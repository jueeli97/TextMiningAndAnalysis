DESPITE THESE BUMPS IN THE
ROAD, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
SO FAR IGNORED GROWING
CRITICISM OF HIS CHOICE AND IS
STANDING BY J.D.
VANCE, CONTINUING TO CALL HIM A
GREAT PICK.
>>> WE ARE EXPECTING TO LEARN
MORE ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPT ON FORMER PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP.
A FEW HOURS SENATE LAWMAKERS
ARE EXPECTED TO QUESTION THE
ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE SECRET
SERVICE ABOUT LAW-ENFORCEMENT
LAPSES IN THE HOURS LEADING UP
TO THE SHOOTING.
THIS COMES AS THE FBI ANNOUNCED
THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAS AGREED
TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERVIEW
CALLED A VICTIM INTERVIEW WITH
THE AGENCY.
OUR SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL
CORRESPONDENT JOINS US WITH
MORE.
THAT HEARING TODAY COMES AFTER
THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE
SECRET SERVICE KIMBERLY CHEATLE
RESIGNED FOLLOWING THE GRILLING
BY BOTH PARTIES LAST WEEK. SHE
WAS DECLINED TO ANSWER WHAT
SEEMED LIKE VERY BASIC
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT.
ARE WE EXPECTING TO SEE MORE OF
THAT TODAY?
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A RARE JOINT
HEARING BETWEEN THE SENATE
HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
IT IS BEING PORTRAYED AS
BIPARTISAN. STAFF MEMBERS FROM
THOSE COMMITTEES HAVE JUST
RETURNED THEMSELVES FROM
BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, THE SITE
OF THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT,
TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION TO
BETTER INFORM THEIR QUESTIONING
OF THE FBI AND SECRET SERVICE
TODAY.
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT REMAINS TO
BE SEEN WHETHER THIS WILL BE
MORE OF THE SAME.
I DO THINK THE RESIGNATION OF
CHEATLE LAST WEEK WAS A
RELEASE OF A PRESSURE VALVE ON
CAPITOL HILL.
IT DID SORT OF ALLEVIATE THE
ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AT
CHEATLE NOT ACCEPTING
RESPONSIBILITY NOW THAT THAT
IS HAPPENED, I THINK THE FOCUS
OF THIS HEARING WILL BE MORE ON
THE SUBSTANCE AND LESS OF THE
THEATER. SO A LOT OF QUESTIONS
STILL REMAIN.
THE SENATORS WILL HIT ON THOSE
TOPICS, INCLUDING HOW DID THIS
SHOOTER, HOW WAS THE SHOOTER
ABLE TO GET A GUN ONTO THE
PREMISES?
BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE
INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON AND WE
LEARNED A NEW DEVELOPMENT JUST
YESTERDAY ON THE HOUSE
INVESTIGATION SIDE WHERE MIKE
JOHNSON AND HAKEEM JEFFRIES
HAVE APPOINTED MEMBERS OF THEIR
SPECIAL TASK FORCE, A
BIPARTISAN TASK FORCE, THAT IS
ALSO LOOKING INTO THIS
SENSATION ATTEMPT?
>> WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET SOME
ANSWERS ON THIS.
AND WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT
INTERVIEW BETWEEN TRUMP AND THE
FBI.
A LOT OF INTEREST IN THAT.
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT IT AND WHAT
ARE INVESTIGATORS HOPING TO
LEARN FROM HIM?
>> Reporter: THIS IS PRETTY
STANDARD, IN FACT, THAT THE
VICTIM OF THIS INCIDENT, OR ANY
INCIDENT, WOULD BE INTERVIEWED.
THE FBI AND SECRET SERVICE, OF
COURSE, ARE INTERVIEWING
EVERYBODY WHO WAS AT THE ACTUAL
SHOOTING.
THEY'VE INTERVIEWED ALREADY
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. BUT FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A UNIQUE
VANTAGE POINT.
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY HE
REACTED IN A CERTAIN WAY BACK
WHEN HE WENT DOWN AND HIT THE
DECK, WHAT WERE THE
CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE
HAPPENING.
WE COULD HEAR THINGS BEING
PICKED UP ON THE MICROPHONE,
SOME OF THOSE INTERACTIONS
BETWEEN SECRET SERVICE AGENTS
THAT RUSH TO ASSIST THE FORMER
PRESIDENT. AND WE HEARD
DIRECTIONS BEING GIVEN, I
THINK, INVESTIGATORS WANT TO
KNOW WHETHER THERE WAS
CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE SECRET
SERVICE AGENTS WHO WERE TELLING
INVESTIGATORS AND WHAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP LATER THIS WEE
