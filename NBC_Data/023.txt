ANNOUNCING ITS BIGGEST CHANGE IN MORE THAN 50 YEARS. AND THAT IS NOT ALL. WE ARE BREAKING DOWN EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU
FLY. >>> GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. I'M JOE FRYER. SAVANNAH SELLERS IS ON ASSIGNMENT. WE BEGIN WITH THE ATTACK ON THE
FRANCH FRENCH HIGH-SPEED NETWORK. THIS AS THE OPENING CEREMONY IN PARIS SET FOR HOURS AWAY.
THE NETWORK WAS TARGETED BY
VANDALS OVERNIGH IN A COORDINATED ARSON ATTACK THAT DAMAGED ITS FACILITY IN A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 800,000
TRAVELERS WILL BE AFFECTED OVER THE COMING WEEKEND AS CREWS RACED TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE. >> HUNDREDS OF PASSENGERS WERE
SEEN STRANDED AT ONE OF THE MAIN STATIONS WAITING FOR UPDATES AFTER MANY TRAINS WERE CANCELED OR DELAYED. >> THIS AHEAD OF THE OPENING
CEREMONY IN PARIS. THOUSANDS EXPECTED TO TRAVEL TO THE EVENT BY TRAIN. OUR NBC NEWS INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT JOINS US WITH
MORE ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY. GOOD MORNING. BRING US UP TO SPEED ON WHAT AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING ABOUT THIS ATTACK AND HOW IT IS
IMPACTING THE REAL NETWORK AND WHO MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE?
>> THE ORGANIZED CRIME UNIT IS TAKING THE LEAD. SO FAR, NO ONE HAS TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS. THERE IS NO INDICATION OF
TERRORISM AT THIS STAGE BUT IT IS A REALLY. THE ATTACK PARALYZED MUCH OF
THE COUNTRY'S HIGH-SPEED RAIL NETWORK AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS ARE SET TO TRAVEL
TODAY TO KICK OFF SUMMER VACATIONS AS WELL AS TRAVEL TO PARIS FOR THE OLYMPICS. THE FRENCH TRANSPORT MINISTER
SAID IT HAPPENED AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING AND THAT THIS WAS A SERIES OF COORDINATED ATTACKS AFFECTING THE ATLANTIC, THE NORTH AND THE EAST.
THE HEAD OF THE REAL NETWORK IN FRANCE CALLED IT A MASSIVE ATTACK SAYING THAT THE FIBER OPTIC TABLES AT THREE LOCATIONS WERE SET ON FIRE.
THEY SAID ONE ATTACK WAS
FOILED. THE ATTACK ON THE SOUTHWESTERN LINE. THE OTHER LINES ARE PRETTY MUCH PARALYZED. THEY SAY THE ATTACKS WERE
PREMEDITATED, COORDINATED AND WITH THE INTENTION TO CAUSE MASSIVE DISRUPTIONS TO THE NETWORK. AND THIS COMES AS THE OPENING
DAY IS STARTING HOURS AWAY. SECURITY IS EXTREMELY TIGHT IN PARIS AND GETTING TIGHTER.
POLICE ARE NOW REINFORCING SECURITY AT TRAIN STATIONS IN
THE CITY. >> DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW THIS WILL IMPACT THE OPENING CEREMONY? AND DO OFFICIALS HOPE THEY CAN GET THINGS UP AND RUNNING
QUICKLY? >> THEY SAY THEY ARE WORKING VERY QUICKLY TO FIX THE DAMAGE.
THEY SAY LIKELY WILL TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS AND THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND.
THE OLYMPIC ORGANIZERS SAY THE OPENING CEREMONY WILL GO AHEAD AS PLANNED. THIS IS WHAT THE SPORTS
MINISTER SAID A SHORT TIME AGO. >> WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING
SOLUTIONS.
IT IS HUGE WORK. WE ARE PREPARED FOR ALL
SCENARIOS. >> THEY HAVE BLANKETED PARIS WITH SECURITY.
45,000 POLICE OFFICERS INCLUDING 650 SPECIALIST OFFICERS WITH TACTICAL UNITS
AND EVEN AN ARMY BATTALION SECURING A MILITARY ZONE. >> PUTTING THIS TO THE SIDE,
WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM TONIGHT'S OPENING CEREMONY?
I KNOW FOLKS IN THE STATES ARE GETTING VERY EXCITED. WHAT DO ORGANIZERS HAVE IN STORE FOR US?
>> IT WILL BE PRETTY SPECTACULAR. FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT WON'T TAKE PLACE IN A STADIUM. ANOTHER FIRST IS THAT IT IS
OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. IT IS EXPECTED TO DRAW THE BIGGEST CROWD EVER.
100 BOATS CARRYING MORE THAN 10,000 ATHLETES CRUISING DOW
PAST SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS LANDMARKS INCLUDING THE PARTIALLY RESTORED NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL AND THE LOUVRE. LEBRON JAMES AND COCO GAUFF
WILL BE FLAG BEARERS FOR TEAM USA.
LADY GAGA AND CELINE DION BOTH RUMORED TO BE PERFORMING. AND I WILL BE AMONG THE 1.5
BILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
TUNING IN TONIGHT. >> I CANNOT WAIT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. APPRECIATE YOU KICKING US OFF
THIS HOUR. WITH THE OPENING CEREMONY SET TO KICK OFF SOON AND SOME EVENTS TAKING PLACE OUTDOORS, WE THOUGHT, WHAT WILL THAT ATHLETES EXPECT WEATHER WISE?
WE HAVE A LOOK AT THAT FORECAST.
GOOD MORNING. >> REPORTER: SO EXCITING. I WISH WE HAD BETTER NEWS. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE CHANCE OF
RAIN. WE HAVE A THREAT FOR RAIN FOR THE OPENING CEREMONY, THE PARADE OF NATIONS. AND THEN THINGS START TO
IMPROVE. WE ARE LOOKING AHEAD TO THE SEVEN-DAY FORECAST. FIRST WE ARE LOOKING AT THE
TRAILING COLD FRONT. THE UK, NORTHERN FRANCE AS WELL INCLUDING PARIS AND GERMANY.
THE RAIN IS SLOWLY MOVING SOUTH AND EAST. WE HAVE DRIZZLE AND A THREAT
FOR SHOWERS AND HEAVIER
DOWNPOURS. SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND. WE HAVE A BIG EXTRAVAGANZA
PLANNED. I'M SURE THEY ARE HOPING WE WON'T GET A LOT OF RAIN BUT WE DO HAVE THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS.
WARMER TEMPERATURES IN THE 70s. 7:30 P.M. AT PARIS TIME IS WHEN IT STARTS. 1:30 P.M.
IS WHEN WE CAN EXPECT IT.
WE HAVE A LOT OF EVENTS HAPPENING SATURDAY AS WELL. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE CHANCE FOR LIGHT RAIN THROUGHOUT THE
DAY. ATHLETES WOULD BE HAPPY WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW 70s. THEN WE DRY OUT AND WARM UP AS
WELL GOING TOWARD THE END OF THE WEEKEND. ON SUNDAY, DRY CONDITIONS. MOSTLY SUNNY. TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S AND THEN WE WARM-UP.
WE ARE LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES MONDAY IN THE UPPER 80S. SUNNY AND HOT BUT DRY.
TEMPERATURES IN THE 90S. AND GOODBYE WEDNESDAY, A FRONT THAT WILL BRING BACK THE CHANCE
OF THUNDERSTORMS AND LIGHTNING INTO THE FORECAST. AND WE ARE WARM STILL WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S. THURSDAY LOOKING NICE WITH LOW
80S. PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL WATCH OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS.
THIS CEREMONY WILL BE SO EXCITING AND SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. WE DO HAVE THE CHANCE FOR
SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST. >> MICHELLE, WE WILL CHECK BACK WITH YOU AND A LITTLE BIT. WE WILL SEE YOU IN A SECOND.
>> YOU CAN TUNE INTO THE OPENING CEREMONY TONIGHT ON NBC AND STREAMING ON PEACOCK AT
7:30 P.M. EASTERN TIME AND 6:30 P.M. CENTRAL. >>> TURNING TO WASHINGTON,
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WRAPPED UP HIS CONTROVERSIAL VISIT TO CAPITOL HILL, PART OF HIS PUSH FOR CONTINUED U.S. SUPPORT IN THE
WAR WITH HAMAS. YESTERDAY, THE PRIME MINISTER MET WITH BOTH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS THAT TWO SEPARATE MEETINGS A
DAY AFTER THE FIERY ADDRESS TO
CONGRESS. HARRIS ECHOED THE PRESIDENT ON THE NEED TO END THE WAR AND BRING HOSTAGES HOME. >> IT IS TIME FOR THE WARD TO
END AND END IN A WAY WHERE ISRAEL IS SECURE AND ALL THE
HOSTAGES ARE RELEASED AND THE SUFFERING OF PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ENDS AND THE PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE CAN EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT
TO FREEDOM, DIGNITY AND SELF DETERMINATION. >> THE MOOD ON CAPITOL HILL
WAS INTENSE THROUGHOUT THE PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT. SEVERAL DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS PROTESTED THE SPEECH. A CONGRESSWOMAN, ONLY
PALESTINIAN AMERICAN WOMAN SERVING IN CONGRESS BROUGHT THESE SIGNS TO BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S ADDRESS. SHE WAS ONE OF SEVERAL
LAWMAKERS SPEAKING OUT.
AND SAYING IT WAS THE WORST PRESENTATION OF ANY FOREIGN
UNITARY. >> OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF CAPITOL HILL, THOUSANDS GATHERED TO PROTEST BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S CONDUCT IN THE WAR
AGAINST HAMAS. SOME CLASHED AND BURNED AMERICAN
FLAGS. >> THE TEAM JOINING US THIS MORNING TO BREAK DOWN THE HISTORIC VISIT INCLUDING NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT AND INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT
SANCHEZ WHO IS IN TEL AVIV.
SO NETANYAHU MET WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND VP HARRIS YESTERDAY. WHAT DO WE HEAR CAME OUT OF THOSE MEETINGS AND HOW DID THE WHITE HOUSE STAGE-MANAGED THIS
MOMENT GIVEN THAT HARRIS IS EXPECTED TO BECOME THE OFFICIAL
NOMINEE. AND INNOCENCE, A LAME-DUCK PRESIDENT WITH SIX MONTHS LEFT IN HIS TERM. >> I THINK STAGE-MANAGED IS
THE RIGHT TERM TO USE. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH A VISITING HEAD OF
STATE SEPARATELY.
THE OTHER THING DIFFERENT HERE IS THE VICE PRESIDENT IS THE ONE WHO MADE THE STATEMENT. THIS IS PART OF THE CAREFUL CHOREOGRAPHY THE WHITE HOUSE IS
HAVING TO DO. THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE
HOUSE ARE VERY MUCH IN THE MINDSET THAT THERE IS ONE PRESIDENT AT A TIME IN THIS
COUNTRY. THAT IS SOMETHING WE HEARD REPEATEDLY AS THERE WAS A TRANSITION FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION. SO THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD TIME TO MEET WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER AND HAVE A
CONVERSATION. BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND VICE
PRESIDENT INDICATED THEY TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR GETTING A DEAL DONE AND ARRIVING AT A CEASE-FIRE AND GETTING HOSTAGES OUT OF GAZA AS WELL AS GETTING
MORE HELP TO THE PEOPLE OF GAZA STILL SUFFERING. THAT IS REALLY THE RESULT OF
WHAT CAME OUT OF THE MEETING.
THERE WAS NOT MUCH READ OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY DISCUSSED OR
THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESSING PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU TO GET THE DEAL FINISHED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
>> WE KNOW THE SPEECH WAS MET WITH MAJOR PROTESTS IN THE U.S. HEADED FOLKS IN ISRAEL RESPOND?
>> ISRAEL IS A POLITICALLY DIVIDED COUNTRY JUST LIKE THE UNITED STATES. THE NETANYAHU SUPPORTERS ON THE POLITICAL RIGHT OF THE COUNTRY,
IT WAS A REMINDER OF BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU'S STRENGTH. HE PRESENTS HIMSELF AS THE ONLY ISRAELI LEADER WITH A STATURE THAT COMMANDS RESPECT IN WASHINGTON THAT CAN ADDRESS A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS FOR
NEARLY AN HOUR AND PERFECT ENGLISH AND RECEIVE 50 PLUS
STANDING OVATIONS. FOR MANY OF THE HOSTAGE FAMILIES, THERE IS DEEP FRUSTRATION THAT THE PRIME
MINISTER DID NOT HAVE VERY MUCH TO SAY IT ALL ABOUT GETTING TO A DEAL TO BRING LOVED ONES HOME AFTER NEARLY 300 DAYS. THE
FATHER OF ONE OF THE AMERICAN ISRAELI HOSTAGES SAID IT WAS BASICALLY POLITICATHEATER AND THAT THIS WAS NETANYAHU SHOWING
OFF TO A DOMESTIC POLITICAL AUDIENCE. REMEMBER THAT HE IS WAY DOWN IN THE POLLS. EVEN SOME PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT,
HIS NATURAL POLITICAL SUPPORTERS, BLAME HIM FOR THE FAILURES LEADING UP TO THE OCTOBER 7 TERROR ATTACK.
HOSTAGE FAMILIES WANT HEAR MORE ABOUT BRINGING LOVED ONES BACK AND NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY REALLY HEARD MUCH DETAIL ABOUT THE FUTURE OF GAZA AND WHO WILL
GOVERN IT AFTER THIS WAR AND CRUCIALLY, WHO WILL PAY FOR THE ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE
RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT? >> YOU MENTIONED A CEASE-FIRE DEAL. WERE TO BE STAND WITH NEGOTIATIONS RIGHT NOW? WE KNOW THAT HERE, FAMILIES OF
THE HOSTAGES MET WITH NETANYAHU AT THE WHITE HOUSE. HOW ARE THEY REACTING TO ALL OF THIS? >> WE DID NOT GET MUCH DETAIL
EITHER ABOUT WHERE EXACTLY THE NEGOTIATIONS AND STAND AT THIS POINT. WE KNOW THERE HAD BEEN SORT OF
A PAUSE OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND VISITING HERE IN THE STATE. THE UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE FROM
THE WHITE HOUSE IS THAT THIS MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME MINISTER, THE PURPOSE WAS TO FILL IN THE
FINAL HOSTAGE DEAL. THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THERE WILL BE SOME MOVEMENT OR CONTINUED MOVEMENT IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS. WE DID HEAR FROM THE FAMILIES
THAT MET WITH THE PRESIDENT. ABOUT 12 PEOPLE MET WITH THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME MINISTER FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR IN THE WHITE HOUSE, BOTH OF THEM
TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME. THE INDICATION WE GET FROM THE FAMILIES AFTER THE MEETING WAS THAT THEY FELT AS THOUGH THEY
GOT A COMMITMENT FROM BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME MINISTER THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THE MOMENT. THAT IS THE PHRASE SOME OF THE
FILM IS USED IN TALKING ABOUT THE MEETING THEY HAD WITH THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME MINISTER. THEY ALSO SAID THEY FEEL MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN PERHAPS THEY
DID SINCE THE BEGINNING, SINCE
THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS A DEAL THAT GOT SOME HOSTAGES OUT OF GAZA. SO INDICATION THAT THERE IS
SOME MOVEMENT HAPPENING. AS WE HEARD OVER AND OVER, IT IS NOT DONE.
>> SPEAKING OF HOSTAGES, WE SHOULD NOTE ISRAELI FORCES SAID THEY RECOVERED THE BODIES OF FIVE HOSTAGES FROM TUNNELS. ONE MORE THING.
NETANYAHU IS EXPECTED TO MEET WITH TRUMP LATER TODAY AT MAR-A-
LAGO. ANY IDEA WHAT THOSE TWO ARE EXPECTED TO TALK ABOUT? >> THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS SUFFERED SOME DAMAGE.
WE KNOW THAT RIGHT AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS ELECTED AND TAKING OFFICE, THE PRIME MINISTER CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS WIN AND FORMER PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAID THAT NETANYAHU WAS
UPSET.
BOTH OF THESE MEN HAVE AN INTEREST IN THIS. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD BE PRESIDENT AGAIN. SO THE PRIME MINISTER HAS AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT
THE RELATIONSHIP CAN SEE SOME STABILITY AGAIN. AND THE PRESIDENT HAS AN INTEREST IN LOOKING AS THOUGH HE CAN STAND ON A WORLD STAGE.
AND THAT IS PART OF WHAT THE MEETING WILL BE ABOUT LATER ON TODAY. >> THANK YOU BOTH.
>>> VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS THIS MORNING IS GETTING BIG TIME SUPPORT FROM SOME BIG NAMED DEMOCRATS IN HER PRESIDENTIAL
BID. >> WE CALLED TO SAY THAT MICHELLE AND I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO ENDORSE YOU AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET YOU
THROUGH THIS ELECTION AND INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. >> THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.
>> THE VIDEO RELEASED TODAY SHOWS FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA CALLING TO PLEDGE HIS SUPPORT TO THE VICE PRESIDENT NOTING THAT HIS WIFE MICHELLE
IS ALSO ENDORSING HARRIS. THEY DISCUSSED HAVING THEM APPEAR TOGETHER ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL. THIS ACCORDING TO THREE SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH THE DISCUSSIONS. PETER ALEXANDER HAS THE LATEST
ON THE RACE FOR THE WHITE
HOUSE. >> VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WELCOMING AND ON STAGE SHOWDOWN WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP ACCUSING HIM OF BACKPEDALING FROM HIS PREVIOUS COMMITMENT TO THE SEPTEMBER DEBATE. >> I THINK THE VOTERS DESERVE
TO SEE THIS ON A DEBATE STAGE. >> JUST THIS WEEK, MR. TRUMP SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING TO DO
MORE THAN ONE DEBATE WITH MS. HARRIS. >> I DO WANT TO DEBATE HER.
SHE WILL BE NO DIFFERENT. THEY HAVE THE SAME POLICIES. >> HEAD-TO-HEAD AS QUICKLY HEATING UP. >> THE PRESIDENT HAS NARROWED
THE ADVANTAGE. THE RACE EFFECTIVELY A TOSSUP ON THE ECONOMY, HARRIS SLAMMING THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S
PROPOSALS AS TAX
CUTS FOR BILLIONAIRES. >> WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE
ARE NOT GOING BACK. >> MR. TRUMP ATTACKING THE VICE PRESIDENT. >> SHE IS THE MOST RADICAL PERSON PROBABLY THAT WE HAVE HAD AN OFFICE LET ALONE THE
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY. >> AND CASTING ASIDE HIS
PROMISE FROM LAST WEEK'S CONVENTION THAT HE WOULD STRIKE A MORE UNIFYING TONE. >> IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'M NOT
GOING TO BE NICE. >> THIS COMES AS PRESIDENT BIDEN DETAILED HIS DECISION TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE.
>> DISCUSSING HIS DESIRE TO UNITE THE COUNTRY BY PASSING THE TORCH TO A NEW GENERATION. >> IT IS A PLACE FOR NEW
VOICES, FRESH VOICES AND YOUNGER VOICES. >> IN THE SELECTION, WE EACH
FACE A QUESTION. >> THE HARRIS TEAM RUNNING WITH ITS FIRST CAMPAIGN VIDEO.
TO THE BEYONCI SONG, "FREEDOM." AND JD VANCE IS FACING A BACKLASH FOR HIS PAST CRITICISM
OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS INCLUDING MS. HARRIS, FOR NOT HAVING CHILDREN. >> HOLLYWOOD STAR JENNIFER
ANISTON POSTING "ALL I CAN SAY MR. VANCE, IS I PRAY YOUR
DAUGHTER IS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BARE CHILDREN OF HER OWN ONE
DAY." IS THE SECOND TO NONE'S WIFE PRAYS TO THE VICE PRESIDENT AS A COPARENT TO THE DOUG EMHOFF
CHILDREN. >> I LOVE OUR BLENDED FAMILY AND I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE HER AND IT. >> WE ARE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN AND WE ARE
EMBRACING A DIFFERENT APPROACH WITH BOTH STYLE AND STRATEGY.
THE YOUNGER CANDIDATE IS VICE PRESIDENT AND EMBRACES POP CULTURE AN APPEAL TO YOUNGER VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN LESS
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT PRESIDENT BIDEN. STRATEGICALLY PERHAPS A DIFFERENT ELECTORAL MAP. AND MOBILIZING DIFFERENT
DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDING SOUTHERN BLACK VOTERS IN STATES LIKE GEORGIA WHERE VICE PRESIDENT
HARRIS WILL HEAD NEXT WEEK. >>> ONE OF THE BIG QUESTION
THAT REMAINS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS WHICH CANDIDATE WILL GET THE SUPPORT FROM VOTERS WHO AT ONE TIME
BACK TO NIKKI HALEY? THIS DRAMATIC SHIFT, WILL THEY STICK WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OR GIVE POMELO HARRIS -- ,
HERE'S A CHANCE. >> TWO DAYS AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN STEPPED ASIDE AND ENDORSED HARRIS.
LET'S BRING IN OUR POLITICAL EDITOR MARK MURRAY. WHAT DOES THE GROUP HAVE TO SAY
ABOUT EIGHT TRUMP HARRIS
MATCHUP? >> AND BEESON'S WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE A FOCUSED GROUP OF 15 DIFFERENT NIKKI HALEY VOTERS
WHO VOTED FOR HER DURING THE PRIMARY SEASON. SOME OF THEM HAD SOME NICE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS.
SOME HAD TOUGH THINGS TO SAY ABOUT HER. BUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING WAS ALL OF THEM SAID THEY WANTED TO
HEAR MORE. THAT SHE IS NOT REALLY DEFINED
FOR THEM. AND I WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE PARIS CAMPAIGN THE NEXT THREE AND HALF MONTHS.
AND OVERALL WHEN IT COMES TO VOTE SUPPORT, YOU END OF HAVING THREE OF THESE NIKKI HALEY
VOTERS THAT SAID THEY WOULD VOTE FOR KAMALA HARRIS. ABOUT FIVE OR SIX SAID THEY WOULD VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP AND
THE REST ENDED UP SAYING THEY WOULD VOTE THIRD PARTY OR NOT AT ALL. >> WE KNOW FOR THESE NIKKI
HALEY VOTERS, AGE IS A BIG FACTOR IN THE RACE BETWEEN PRESIDENT BIDEN AND DONALD TRUMP. ON ELECTION DAY, THERE WILL BE AN 18 YEAR GAP BETWEEN HARRIS
AND TRUMP. HOW IMPORTANT OF AN ISSUE IS THIS? >> THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT CAME UP IN THE FOCUS GROUP.
WE DO HAVE THE NEW DYNAMIC OF JOE BIDEN NOT BEING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT THE FOCUS
GROUP RESPONDENTS HAD TO SAY.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AGE ISSUE FOR A MOMENT. NOW THAT BIDEN IS OUT OF THE
RACE, IS IT PERSUASIVE FOR DEMOCRATS TO ARGUE THAT TRUMP, AT THE AGE OF 78, WOULD BE THE OLDEST PERSON EVER INAUGURATED?
>> THE AGE IS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN. AND IS A TIME FOR NEW
GENERATIONS OF LEADERS TO TAKE OVER. >> WHO THINKS THIS IS A
PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT? >> TELL ME VERY QUICKLY IN THE
INTEREST OF TIME, WHAT PART DO YOU AGREE WITH? >> I AGREE IT IS TIME FOR NEW,
YOUNGER LEADERSHIP. >> THEY WERE BOTH TOO OLD IN THE FIRST PLACE AND WE NEED A
NEW GENERATION OF POLITICAL LEADERS. >> THE WORLD THEY ARE GOING
THROUGH, I CANNOT IMAGINE.
JUST THE TOPICS AND ISSUES ARE SO MUCH DIFFERENT AND HAVE TO BE HANDLED SO MUCH
DIFFERENTLY.
>> AS YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING, AGE IS A FACTOR BUT NOT THAT
BIG OF A FACTOR. ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS IS THAT IT WAS CONDUCTED AFTER SO
MANY BIG EVENTS LIKE THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION AND JOE BIDEN LEAVING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. HOW A LOT OF PERCEPTIONS HAVE
NOT CHANGED DESPITE ALL THE A PEOPLE WE HAVE SEEN. >> AMAZING. MARK MURRAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> EARLIER WE WERE IN A WEATHER FOR PARIS. LET'S SHOW YOU WHAT TO EXPECT ON THE SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC.
THE SOUTH WILL SEE HEAVY RAIN. TEMPERATURES IN THE 90S AND THE
MIDWEST. >> THAT IS RIGHT. WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT CONTINUED
UNSETTLED SALT. SHOWERS AND STORMS HIT SOME COULD BRING HEAVY RAINFALL. WERE LOOKING AT THE CHANCE OF FLOODING AND THAT INCLUDES
FLASH FLOODING. THIS IS WHAT THE RADAR LOOKS LIKE NOW. YOU CAN SEE THE DARKER RETURNS OF THE RED, ORANGE AND YELLOW.
THAT IS WHERE WE SEE THE HEAVIEST RAIN FALLING. SO PORTIONS OF LOUISIANA AND
EASTERN TEXAS AND INTO TENNESSEE AND THEN ALONG THE CAROLINAS. THAT IS SOMETHING WE WILL SEE THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND ENDED THE WEEKEND AS WELL.
THE GULF COAST, THE SOUTHEAST ON THE CAROLINAS COULD SEE HEAVY RAIN. THIS ALL BECAUSE OF THE COLD
FRONT BRINGING SHOWERS AND STORMS. SO ANOTHER UNSETTLED DAY AND
ANOTHER UNSETTLED WEEKEND. WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT SEVERE WEATHER ALTHOUGH WE COULD SEE GUSTY THUNDERSTORMS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WILL BE
FLOODING IN SPOTS AS WE SEE HEAVY DOWNPOURS WITH A LOT OF MOISTURE IN THE AIR.
AND SOME FLOODING CONDITIONS. SATURDAY, MORE SCATTERED SHOWERS ALONG THE GULF COAST. AREAS OF RAINFALL ENTERING THE MIDWEST. THE BIG STORY WILL BE THE
WARMER TEMPERATURES.
TELNET 10 MILLION PEOPLE IN EASTERN TEXAS ARE AFFECTED INCLUDING THE CAROLINAS AND MYRTLE BEACH.
WHERE YOU SEE THE RED AS A FLASH FLOOD WARNING. WE ARE SEEING FLOODING
HAPPENING NOW. THAT WILL BE THE CASE THROUGHOUT THE DAY. IT WILL BE MOVING IN FROM TIME TO TIME.
BE CAREFUL HEADING OUT AND ABOUT ON THIS FRIDAY. THE RAINFALL FORECAST, LOOKING AT A LOT OF RAIN.
WE ARE SEEING THE RED, THE YELLOW AND ORANGE. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE EXPECTING
THE HEAVIEST RAIN FROM THE GULF COAST AND THE SOUTHEAST IN THE CAROLINAS COAST AS WELL. OTHERWISE, A NICE DAY IN THE
OHIO VALLEY. MIDATLANTIC, ON THE WARM SIDE. VERY SUMMERLIKE TEMPERATURES. AND HUMIDITY HAS DROPPED. SO FEELING REALLY NICE.
WARM THROUGHOUT THE MIDWEST AND THE NORTHERN PLAINS WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S AND 90S. WE HAVE A HEAT ALERT FOR FARGO.
AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT FIRE DANGER OUT WEST. TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S IN
MINNEAPOLIS. 95, OMAHA. A WARM ONE THERE TODAY AND ALSO TOMORROW. BACK TO YOU.
>>> WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO GET TO ON MORNING NEWS NOW INCLUDING CHANGE IN THE AIR FOR
ONE MAJOR AIRLINE. WHY IS SOUTHWEST IS DITCHING ITS TRADEMARK OPEN SEATING. FIRST, A WOMAN DUBBED THE GUCCI GODDESSES SENTENCED TO PRISON.
THE JAIL TIME SHE FACES AF>> ME, WHY IS IT SO TOUGH RIGHT NOW? >> NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF
NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW.
>>> WE ARE NOW BACK WITH NEWS OF THE ARREST OF TWO MAJOR FIGURES OF THE VIOLENT MAJOR
DRUG CARTEL. EL CHAPO HAS BEEN ARRESTED IN TEXAS AND SO HAS A COFOUNDER
WHO HELPED LEAD THE ORGANIZATION FOR DECADES. MERRICK GARLAND SAID EL CHAPO
AND GARCIA FACE MULTIPLE CHARGES
IN CONNECTION WITH THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DID NOT PROVIDE DETAILS.
THE CARTELS ARE AT THE HEART OF THE SYNTHETIC DRUG CRISIS IN THE UNITED STATES. >>> A WOMAN NAMED GUCCI GODDESS
IS ACCUSED OF STEALING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE
UNITED STATES ARMY THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO TO CHILDREN IN MILITARY FAMILIES. MARISSA PARRA HAS THE DETAILS.
>> Reporter: THE WOMAN DUBBED THE GUCCI GODDESS IS BEHIND BARS WHERE SHE IS SENTENCED TO
SPEND THE NEXT 15 YEARS. THE FORMER ARMY EMPLOYER FOUND
GUILTY OF STEALING NEARLY $109 MILLION ORIGINALLY MET FOR
CHILDREN IN MILITARY FAMILIES AND, INSTEAD, USED IT FOR OWN PERSONAL LUXURY. >> THIS WAS THE LARGEST FRAUD
THE UNITED STATES ARMY HAS SEEN BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL.
>> Reporter: WORKING AS A FINANCIAL PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE UNITED STATES ARMY INCLUDING SERVICES, PROSECUTORS SAY SHE CREATED A SHAM BUSINESS
ADDING THAT SHE ROUTINELY BETRAYED THE TRUST OF
COLLEAGUES TO GET APPROVALS AND SOMETIMES FORGING SIGNATURES TO FRAUDULENTLY SECURE GRANTS.
THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MEANT FOR MILITARY CHILDREN DEPOSITED INTO HER OWN BANK ACCOUNT AND
MILITARY FAMILIES DID NOT SEE A PENNY. >> OVER A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS, MILITARY CHILDREN WHO
THEMSELVES MAKE SACRIFICES AS THEIR PARENTS SERVE OUR NATION MISSED OUT ON ESSENTIAL FUNDING THAT DID NOT RECEIVE THE BENEFITS THEY WOULD HAVE
RECEIVED IF NOT FOR THIS SCHEME. >> Reporter: INSTEAD, HER
SCHEMING FUNDED AT LEAST 31 PIECES OF REAL ESTATE LIKE THESE LAVISH MANSIONS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, 82
DIFFERENT VEHICLES LIKE MOTORCYCLES AND CLASSIC CARS AND EVEN SPENT $923,000 IN
JEWELRY ON ONE DAY, JUST A FRACTION OF THE TOTAL SPENT FOR MORE THAN 1500 PIECES.
>> THE PROCESS IS UNDERWAY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO RETURNING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. >> Reporter: AS INVESTIGATORS WORK TO RECOVER THOSE
MISAPPROPRIATED FUNDS, SHE WAS SENTENCED AFTER PLEADING GUILTY TO FIVE COUNTS OF MAIL FRAUD AND FIVE COUNTS OF FILING A FALSE TAX RETURN.
>> WE BELIEVE THAT THE SENTENCE THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE
GUIDELINES WAS APPROPRIATE AND WE BELIEVE THAT SHE SHOULD'VE GOTTEN SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT LESS. THIS WAS A LOT OF THE FACT THAT
SHE COOPERATED. SHE RETURNED A LOT OF THE MONEY AND WE EXPECT A LOT MORE WILL BE RETURNED IN THE FUTURE.
>> Reporter: THE PROSECUTOR STANDING FIRM SAYING 15 YEARS IS MORE THAN FAIR. >> WE NEED TO SEND A REALLY STRONG MESSAGE THAT YOU WILL
NOT BE ABLE TO DO THIS. WE WILL NOT TOLERATE IT.
>> Reporter: MELISSA PAREKH, NBC NEWS. >>> NORTH KOREA IS FACING
OBLIGATIONS -- ALLEGATIONS OF CYBER ATTACKS AND STEALING MILITARY SECRETS. CLAUDIO LAVANGA. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING CALL
--, JOE. SOUTH KOREA ACCUSING NORTH KOREA OF CONDUCTING A GLOBAL CYBER ESPIONAGE AND GOT
STEALING CLASSIFIED MILITARY SECRETS. THE HACKERS REACHED COMPUTER
SYSTEMS IN VARIOUS DEFENSE AND ENGINEERING FIRMS INCLUDING ONES THAT MANUFACTURE AIRCRAFTS, NAVY VESSELS AND
SYSTEMS. NASA AND AIR FORCE BASES IN TEXAS AND GEORGIA WERE ALSO TARGETS. >>> NOW TO VENEZUELA WHERE A CRITICAL ELECTION WILL BE TAKING PLACE THIS SUNDAY.
VOTERS WILL DECIDE. GONZALES IS A FORMER AMBASSADOR
AND HAS NEVER HELD PUBLIC OFFICE. DESPITE 21 MILLION VENEZUELANS BEING REGISTERED TO VOTE. ONLY
ABOUT 17 MILLION ARE EXPECTED TO VOTE. >>> TO SOUTH AFRICA WHERE THEY HAVE APPOINTED THEIR FIRST EVER
CHIEF JUSTICE. SHE CURRENTLY SERVES AS THE DEPUTY CHIEF JUSTICE AND WAS
PREVIOUSLY THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN APPOINTED TO THE SUPREME COURT. HER HISTORIC TERM BEGINS ON SEPTEMBER 1st. BACK TO YOU.
>>> COMING UP, HIS ARREST MADE
>>> WE ARE BACK WITH THE LATEST ON THE DWI CHARGE AGAINST JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE. THE POPSTAR'S ATTORNEY AND PROSECUTORS IN SAG HARBOR ARE
MEETING IN A VIRTUAL COURT CONFERENCE, TODAY. THE SINGER WILL NOT BE MAKING
AN APPEARANCE. HE WAS ARRESTED LAST MONTH AND CHARGED WITH DRIVING WHILE
INTOXICATED AFTER ALLEGEDLY WEAVING OUT OF HIS LANE AND ROLLING THROUGH A STOP SIGN. HE WAS RELEASED THE VERY NEXT
DAY AND CONTINUED ON HIS WORLD TOUR. WE KNOW TIMBERLAKE WON'T BE THERE, TODAY.
HE IS CURRENTLY TOURING IN EUROPE. IS THAT NORMAL?
>> THIS IS A VERY STANDARD PRETRIAL COURT HEARING AND IT IS BETWEEN THE PROSECUTOR AND THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY AND THE
DEFENSE UNDERSTANDS WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE THE PROSECUTOR HAS AND WHAT WAS IN THE POLICE
REPORT, WHAT POLICE HAVE BROUGHT FORTH AND TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY POTENTIAL FOR A PLEA DEAL. THAT IS USUALLY WHERE THIS
GOES. >> THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT AND NO ONE WAS HURT SO IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY COULD REACH A PLEA
DEAL, WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE? >> IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS THE
MOST LIKELY POSSIBILITY. THIS LAWYER IS THE SAME LAWYER
WHO NEGOTIATED A PLEA DEAL ON BEHALF OF JASON KIDD IN THE SAME AREA OF THE HAMPTONS.
I IMAGINE THAT COULD BE SOME SORT OF A BLUEPRINT SO THERE IS A DWI CHARGE FOR JASON KIDD AND
JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, THAT IS A CRIMINAL MISDEMEANOR. THERE IS ALSO A DW A I CHARGE
WHICH IS MORE OF A TRAFFIC VIOLATION, DRIVING WHILE IMPAIRED SO OFTEN A PLEA DEAL, IF YOU PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO THE
FIRST AND ULTIMATELY DO COMMUNITY SERVICE, IT CAN TURN INTO A GUILTY PLEA WITH REGARDS TO THE SECOND.
WHAT JASON KIDD WAS REQUIRED TO DO WAS AMENITY SERVICE TO TALK TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN LONG
ISLAND AND WARNED THEM OF THE DANGERS OF DRUNK DRIVING.
IT WOULD BE SIMILAR. AVOID PRISON TIME. >> LET'S ASSUME THERE IS NO
PLEA DEAL AND THIS MOVES FORWARD. SO FAR, THIS HAS NOT IMPACTED HIS TOUR AND HE HAS BEEN ABLE
TO STAY IN EUROPE. COULD THAT CHANGE OR GET TO THE POINT WHERE HE WOULD HAVE TO
START MAKING COURT APPEARANCES IN PERSON? >> IF IT DOES GO TO TRIAL, HE WOULD HAVE TO BE THERE AND IN
THE STATE OF NEW YORK, A DWI TRIAL USUALLY HAPPENS WITHIN
THREE MONTHS. IT WOULD BE A SIX-MEMBER JURY AND THAT IS THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE HE WOULD HAVE TO BE IN COURT. >> IT WILL LIKELY BE A SHORT
TRIAL, I WOULD ASSUME. >> THIS IS PRETTY COMMON IN THE
HAMPTONS, A SERIES CHARGE BUT NOT UNCOMMON. >>> IT IS SOON TO BE THE END OF THE ERA IN THE SKY.
SOUTHWEST IS ORGANIZING A MAJOR SHAKEUP, SCRAPPING THE UNIQUE OPEN SEATING MODEL AFTER IT'S
ALL MAJOR PROFIT LOSSES COMPARED TO ITS COMPETITORS. EMILIE IKEDA SPOKE TO THE CEO
ABOUT WHY THEY ARE MAKING THE CHANGE AND WHEN IT WILL TAKE
EFFECT. >> Reporter: AND MAJOR CHANGE OF COURSE FOR SOUTHWEST AIRLINES WILL SOON START ASSIGNING SEATS AND SELLING
SOME WITH EXTRA LEGROOM ENDING MORE THAN 50 YEARS OF ITS FAMOUS OR FOR SOME, INFAMOUS MODEL OF OPEN SEATING WHERE BOARDING CAN BUILD INTO A MAD
DASH. WHILE SOME FANS ARE DISAPPOINTED --
>> I LOVE OPEN SEATING AND THAT IS WHY I FLY SOUTHWEST. >> Reporter: THE CEO SAYS THE
MOVES IS A BID TO BOOST REVENUE AND ADAPT TO TRAVELERS. 80% ONE AND ASSIGNED SEAT,
ESPECIALLY ON LONGER FLIGHTS. >> WHEN A CUSTOMER DEFECTS TO
NUMBER ONE COMPETITOR, IT IS THE RIGHT THING AT THE RIGHT TIME. >> Reporter: MANY AIRLINES ARE
GRAPPLING WITH OVERCAPACITY. SOUTHWEST RECORDED A 46% DROP IN PROFIT FROM LAST YEAR FACING GROWING RIVALRIES WITH OTHER
BUDGET OPTIONS. >> WHAT KIND OF HEADWINDS IS THE AIRLINES FACING RIGHT NOW?
>> Reporter: THEY HAVE SIMPLY ADDED TO MANY SEATS WHEN IT COMES TO BASIC ECONOMY SEATS. IN OTHER WORDS, SEATS THAT
PEOPLE ARE BUYING AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE FARE. SO MANY ADDED INTO THE SYSTEM NOT I JUST SOUTHWEST BUT OTHER
AIRLINES, IT HAS PUT A LID ON AIRFARES. >> SOUTHWEST HAS BOOKINGS FOR A
SIGNED AND PREMIUM SEATS AVAILABLE SOMETIME NEXT YEAR. THE AIRLINES WILL HAVE TO UPDATE THE CABIN LAYOUT AND GET
FAA APPROVAL FOR THE CHANGE. I WANT TO BRING IN MARK ELWOOD
FOR MORE ON THIS. I FLEW SOUTHWEST WHEN I LIVED ON THE WEST COAST. I ENJOYED IT, I GOT USED TO T
SO I KNEW HOW TO WORK THIS IS A AND ALWAYS GET A GOOD SEAT BUT
HOW BIG OF A DEAL IS IT THAT SOUTHWEST IS MAKING THIS CHANGE INCLUDED AFFECT THE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS AVAILABLE? >> Reporter: I LOVE THE SYSTEM.
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THIS IS A BIT OF A SOAP OPERA.
THE NAME IS THE SAME BUT IT IS GOING TO LOOK SO DIFFERENT. SOUTHWEST ESSENTIALLY SAYING, EVERYONE COPIED US MAKING IT
REALLY EASY TO GET A CHEAP SEAT
ON BOARD. I THINK THE BIG NEWS ISN'T JUST THE OPEN SEATING GOING AWAY.
IT IS THE RED EYES. WHAT A REDEYE ALLOWS YOU TO DO IS KEEP THE PLANE IN THE SKY FOR MORE HOURS EACH DAY AND
SQUEEZE MORE MONEY OUT OF THE SAME AIRCRAFT.
>> THAT OPEN SEATING MODEL WAS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT SOUTHWEST WAS ABLE TO KEEP A LOT OF THEIR PRICES LOWER THAN OTHER
AIRLINES. DOES THIS MEAN I HAVE TO ASSUME SOUTHWEST FLIGHTS ARE GOING TO GET MORE EXPENSIVE IF YOU ARE GETTING THOSE ASSIGNED SEATS?
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE BOTTOM LINE? >> Reporter: I THINK WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS NOT MAKE THEIR SEATS LOOK MORE EXPENSIVE
WHILE EFFECTIVELY MAKING THEM MORE PRICIER. THEY ARE UNBUNDLING AND BASICALLY NOT TELLING YOU WHAT
IT WILL REALLY COST UPFRONT. I AM SURE THAT WILL LEAVE
OPTIONAL EXTRAS YOU CAN NOW BUY WHICH WILL BE SEATING AND MEALS AND EXTRA LEGROOM, YOU NAME IT. SO PRICES MAY GO UP BUT IT WILL
LOOK LIKE THEY ARE AND THAT IS THE DREAM FOR THEM. >> ARE YOU SURPRISED THEY STUCK
WITH THIS FOR AS LONG AS THEY DID WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH MONEY OTHER AIRLINES ARE MAKING OFF OF SEAT UPGRADES AND IS
SOUTHWEST, THERE CHANGE GOING TO IMPACT OTHER AIRLINES AT ALL AND WHAT THEY DECIDE TO DO?
>> Reporter: I AM ASTONISHED THIS HAS LASTED AS LONG AS IT HAS. IT IS ALL ABOUT PEOPLE ABUSING
THE PREBOARDING FACILITY AND GETTING ON BOARD EARLY WITHOUT PAYING. THAT HAS BEEN THE TIPPING POINT
ON THIS. DO I THINK THIS WILL IMPACT OTHER AIRLINES? NOT REALLY. SOUTHWEST IS REALLY JUST
PLAYING CATCH-UP. THE SAD THING IS, IF YOU LOVED ALL OF SOUTHWEST, GET READY FOR
A VERY NEW EXPERIENCE. >> SOUTHWEST HAS BEEN CAUGHT
BETWEEN DELTA AND THE
TRADITIONAL AIRLINES? HAVE THEY SORT OF BEEN CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE GROUND? >> Reporter: THAT IS EXACTLY IT. INSTEAD OF THE PREMIUM THAT
DELTA WAS TRYING TO SELL US LAST WEEK AND VERY CHEAP CAME WITH THE HEAPEST THAT COULD BE, SOUTHWEST WAS NEITHER ONE
THING OR THE OTHER. IN THE CURRENT WORLD, THAT IS NOT A GREAT PLACE TO BE.

>>> LET'S GO TO NASHVILLE WHERE THE WORLDS OF CRYPTO AND POLITICS ARE CONVERGING AT THE ANNUAL BIT COIN CONFERENCE.
THE THREE-DAY EVENT TOUTED AS THE LARGEST IN INDUSTRY FEATURES PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS BY TOP NAMES IN THE
BIT COIN SPACE IN THIS YEAR'S HEADLINER IS FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF DIGITAL
ASSET RESEARCH. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
EXPLAIN WHAT THIS CONFERENCE ACCOMPLISHES AND WHY IT IS SUCH A BIG DEAL FOR THE CRYPTO COMMUNITY. >> GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
IT IS A BIT COIN CONFERENCE UNLIKE OTHER EVENTS IN THE INDUSTRY THAT FOCUS AND
THOUSANDS OF OTHER ASSETS DOWN THE LINE, THIS ONE IS FOCUSED ON BIT COIN, ITS ADOPTION, ITS
DEVELOPMENT AND ITS PRICE, AS WELL. THAT IS THE ATTRACTION.
THEY CALL THEMSELVES BIT COIN
MAXIS. TO THE ORIGINAL MISSION OF DECENTRALIZATION AND FREE MONEY.
>> WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS YEAR'S CONFERENCE COMPARED TO OTHERS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST? >> DONALD TRUMP, IT IS GOING TO
BE HIS FIRST APPEARANCE AT SUCH AN EVENT AND THE FIRST
APPEARANCE EVER FOR SOMEONE OF HIS STATURE TO APPEAR AT A CRYPTO EVENT AND IT HAS THE WHOLE INDUSTRY BUZZING.
LAST YEAR, THEY HAD PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL SANDLER WHO WROTE A BOOK AND ROBERT F KENNEDY
JUNIOR USED THE EVENT TO ANNOUNCE HIS PRESIDENTIAL BID BUT THIS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN STARVED FOR ATTENTION AND
FRANKLY, A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
IT FEELS LIKE IT HAS BEEN IN THE PENALTY BOX FOR YEARS SO WHEN YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT SAYING NICE THINGS ABOUT
CRYPTO, THEY ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GET PAST THE BAD THINGS HE SAID ABOUT CRYPTO
WHEN HE FELT IT WAS WORTHLESS AND MOSTLY USEFUL FOR STAMPS AND THEY ARE GOING TO, I WOULD IMAGINE, GIVE HIM A RAUCOUS
PROCESSION AND THEY ARE EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HE CAN CITE. HE IS GOING TO PUT IN AN FCC
DIRECTOR OR AN FCC CHAIRMAN TO LOOSEN RULES FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY
INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES AND MAKE THEM FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THE PENALTY
BOX. >> TRAP IS SET TO APPEAR TOMORROW, WALK US THROUGH HIS STANCE ON CRYPTO AND TO ME, IT BEGS THE QUESTION, AS CRYPTO
BECOME A PARTISAN ISSUE? >> ALL GOOD POINTS.
FRANKLY, WHEN IT COMES TO DONALD TRUMP, NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY UNTIL HE SAYS IT. HE HAD LIPS ON HIS SPEECHES.
HIS POLICY, HIS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CRYPTO I THINK IS LESS THAN SOME ATTENDEES WANT IT TO BE.
THE FIRST THING HE SAID IS THAT HE HOPES ALL WILL BE -- THAT IS
COMPLETELY OPPOSITE. IT IS SUPPOSED TO CONCENTRATE ACTIVITY IN ONE COUNTRY.
I IMAGINE HE WILL SAY THINGS LIKE THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, JOE BIDEN AND NOW KAMALA HARRIS HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATE
TOWARD THE INDUSTRY. HE IS GOING TO CHANGE ALL OF THAT AND THAT WILL HAVE A LOT OF APPLAUSE. >> IT IS NOT JUST TRUMP, ROBERT
F KENNEDY, EDWARDS NOTED, THE WHISTLEBLOWER. WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
HAVING FIGURES LIKE THAT, SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL FIGURES ON THE STAGE?
>> ROBERT F KENNEDY JUNIOR, THIS WILL BE HIS SECOND APPEARANCE AT THE EVENT. LAST NIGHT, HE GAVE SOME COMMENTS AND IS FULLY
COMMITTED. HE IS REFERRED TO A PARASITIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONGRESS
AND THE BED WHICH I THINK MIGHT BE A LITTLE UNFAIR TO THE BED
GIVEN THAT CONGRESS HAS BEEN SO UNPRODUCTIVE RECENTLY BECAUSE OF THE BIPARTISANSHIP THAT IS
IN SOME WAYS TAKING OVER SOME DUTIES OF CONGRESS BUT BESIDES, HE IS GOING TO SAY SIMILAR THINGS TO TRUMP. REGARDING EDWARDS NOTED, HIS
RELATIONSHIP WITH BIT COIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE BIT INTERESTING BECAUSE HE IS AGAINST SURVEILLANCE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.
THE NATURE MEANS THAT EVERY TRANSACTION GOING BACK TO THE
HISTORY, PUBLISHED ON CHAIN SO HE IS REALLY FOCUSED ON WAYS FOR BIT COIN DEVELOPERS TO ADD
PRIVACY AND FEATURES ON TOP OF THE BIT COIN. WHEN PEOPLE NEED TO USE IT NOT
ONLY FOR ILLICIT PURPOSES BUT TO DETECT THEMSELVES FROM AN AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT, THEY ARE ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT
REVEALING MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES THAN NECESSARY. >> STEPHEN IRWIN, THANK YOU.
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR EXPERTISE. >>> COMING UP, TAKING THE
PLUNGE. IN A REMARKABL
>>> WELCOME BACK. A DOG THAT WENT MISSING FOR NINE YEARS HAS BEEN REUNITED WITH HIS OWNER.

THIS TRICK UNTIL A STRANGER PICKED HIM UP AND DROPPED THEM OFF AT A NEARBY HOSPITAL.
THERE, THE STAFF IDENTIFIED HIM THROUGH HIS MICROCHIP AND JUST LAST WEEK, THE 11-YEAR-OLD WAS RETURNED HOME IN AN EMOTIONAL REUNION.
HE IS NOW GETTING ALL OF THE LOVE AND ATTENTION HE DESERVES.

>> Reporter: SHE WRITES THE NAMES OF PEOPLE IN HER OWN LIFE WHO HAVE BEEN TOUCHED BY CANCER. SHE HAS HAD HER OWN BATTLE WITH
CANCER THIS YEAR, A BENIGN TUMOR THAT RUPTURED. SHE WAS HOSPITALIZED IN OHIO.
>> THE SECOND I GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL, I WAS LIKE, I WANT TO STILL DO THIS. MY PARENTS WERE LIKE, WE CAN
TRY. >> Reporter: SHE HAD TO HIT THE CURRENT JUST RIGHT. >> I HAD BEEN SWIMMING FOR 11
HOURS AT THIS POINT. AND THEY WERE LIKE, YOU HAVE TO SPRINT. AS FAST AS I COULD.
>> I DON'T THINK SHE REALIZES HOW CLOSE SHE IS, RIGHT NOW.
>> Reporter: FOR THE LAST 100 YARDS, HER DAD WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HER. SHE REACHED THE ROCKY SHORE. >> WE PULLED HER ONTO THE VOTE
AND I IMMEDIATELY HUGGED HER AND BRIEF A SIGH OF RELIEF. WE GOT IT DONE. >> Reporter: SHE HAS NOW
COMPLETED THREE OF THE OPEN WATER SWIM'S KNOWN AS THE TRIPLE CROWN. >> SEEING HER ACCOMPLISH IT AND
GET IT DONE BRINGS SO MUCH
HAPPINESS. >> Reporter: DID YOU CRY? >> ABSOLUTELY. JUST A LITTLE BIT. >> I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT
TO FIND SOMETHING YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT IN LIFE. YOU CAN USE THAT TO INSPIRE
OTHER PEOPLE. >> MY HEAD TOLD HER NOW THAT SHE HAS DONE THE TRIPLE CROWN,
SHE WANTS TO FINISH WHAT IS CALLED THE OCEAN SEVEN AND THAT MEANS TACKLING MORE WATERS IN JAPAN, SPAIN, IRELAND, SCOTLAND AND NEW ZEALAND.
THAT IS GOING THAT WILL DO IT FOR THIS HOUR OF WARNING NEWS NOW. THE NEWS CONTINUES RIGHT NOW.

MORGAN CHESKY JOINS US FROM CHICO, CALIFORNIA WITH THE LATEST. THE PARK FIRE HAS FORCED EVACUATION ORDERS AND WARNINGS
IN ADDITION TO DEVASTATED -- DEVASTATING MANY HOMES. WHAT'S THE SITUATION ? >> Reporter: IT HAS CONTINUED
TO GROW RAPIDLY HERE NORTH OF US IN CHICO. WE SAW IT BURNED 50,000 ACRES.
AT LAST CHECK IT HAS BURNED 150,000 ACRES. IN LARGE PART TO VAST WOODED
AREAS WITH HIGH WINDS THAT HAVE PUSHED THE FLAMES THROUGH FORCING THOSE EVACUATIONS AS YOU MENTIONED. NO DEATHS OR INJURIES TO REPORT
RIGHT NOW. I CAN TELL YOU THIS PARTICULAR FIRE IS BRINGING FRIGHTENING
DIJ@ VU IN THAT IT WAS SIX YEARS AGO WE HAD 80 PEOPLE KILLED IN THE DEADLY FIRE IN
PARADISE THAT DESTROYED 90 % OF
THAT TOWN. THOSE SURVIVORS RESETTLED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IN NORTH CHICO THAT HAD TO BE EVACUATED BECAUSE OF THIS FIRE.
THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT HAS SEEN THAT DESTRUCTION FIRSTHAND AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S A LOT OF
FOLKS ON EDGE EVEN THOUGH FOR THE MOST PART THIS FIRE APPEARS TO BE BURNING TO THE NORTH AWAY FROM THE MORE POPULATED AREAS.
>> SO HARD TO ESCAPE THESE WILDFIRES. A SURPRISING NUMBER OF WILDFIRES ARE STARTED BY OUR SIN.
WE KNOW A 42-YEAR-OLD MAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR SPARKING THE MASSIVE WILDFIRE. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE
SUSPECT AND HOW POLICE BELIEVE HE STARTED IT ? >> Reporter: AUTHORITIES TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY AND ANNOUNCE MORE DETAILS HOW THEY BELIEVE
IT STARTED. THEY SAY THIS MAN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WAS WITNESSED PUSHING A FLAMING CAR INTO A RAVINE.
THE RECENT STILL UNKNOWN.
HE HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AND FACING THOSE ARSON CHARGES. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MOTIVATED HIM TO DO SO. THEY SAY THEY BELIEVE THAT
FLAMING CAR WAS THE CATALYST FOR THIS NOW 150,000 ACRE FIRE. THE LARGEST IN OUR STATE THAT
IS CURRENTLY 3 % CONTAINED. >> THERE'S ANOTHER MAJOR FIRE
OVER THE BORDER IN OREGON. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT ONE ? >> Reporter: THAT IS BURNING IN
A RURAL AREA. THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY. IT'S BURNED A QUARTER MILLION ACRE SHUTTING DOWN VARIOUS ROADWAYS THROUGH THAT AREA. IT'S NOT HIGHLY POPULATED.
IT'S BURNED A VAST AREA OF LAND.
THE CAUSE THEY BELIEVE WAS A LIGHTNING STRIKE THAT TOOK PLACE MORE THAN A WEEK AGO. DUE TO THE REMOTE NATURE WITH
THIS FIRE IS BURNING, CREWS ARE HAVING A TOUGH TIME GETTING INTO POSITION CUTTING THOSE FIRE LINES AND SLOWING THE
SPREAD. WE ARE ANTICIPATING TRIPLE DIGIT TEMPERATURES FOR THE NEXT
SEVERAL DAYS.
THAT FIRE SO BIG HERE THAT EXPERTS SAY IT'S CREATED ITS OWN FIRE THUNDERSTORM. THE PYRO CUMULUS CLOUDS BECAUSE IT'S PUTTING UP SUCH INTENSE HEAT.
THAT'S A CONCERN BECAUSE IT CAN CARRY SMOKE AND ASH EVEN FURTHER POTENTIALLY SPARKING A LIGHTNING SPARK THAT COULD GET ANOTHER FIRE.
>>> LET'S GET TO THE WEATHER FORECAST. METEOROLOGIST MICHELLE GROSSMAN IS WITH US.
>>> LET'S START WITH THE FIRES SINCE MORGAN WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FIRE THREAT. WE HAVE RED FLAG WARNINGS ACROSS THE WEST INTO THE
INTERMOUNTAIN WEST. WE AREONCERNED FOR THOSE DRY THUNDERSTORMS. WHAT IS A DRY THUNDERSTORMS ? A
THUNDERSTORM THAT HAPPENS A LOT. THE RAIN EVAPORATES AND DOESN'T HIT THE GROUND.
IT DOESN'T HYDRATE THE DRY
VEGETATION.
THE LIGHTNING STRIKE HAPPENS WE GET THE FIRE GOING. WE HAVE THE OUTFLOW FROM THE THUNDERSTORM THAT CREATES THE WIND THAT WILL PUSH THE FIRE.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. WE HAVE AIR-QUALITY ALERTS THROUGHOUT THE WEST. THE SMOKE IS GOING TO PORTIONS OF THE MIDWEST. THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT. THE WILDFIRE SEASON IS UNTIL OCTOBER. WE'VE GOT MANY MONTHS TO GET
THROUGH. HERE ARE THE RED FLAG WARNINGS. IT'S HOT, WINDY. WE'VE GOT FIRE WEATHER WATCHES.
GOT A CRITICAL RISK TO THE DAKOTAS AND WESTERN NEBRASKA. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REST OF
TODAY. STILL SUNNY AND WARM IN THE WEST. IT WILL BE A NICE DAY. LET'S START WITH THE GOOD NEWS. WE ARE LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES
SUMMERLIKE BUT THE HUMIDITY HAS DROPPED. WE HAD A COLD FRONT FROM THE NORTHEAST BRINGING NICE CONDITIONS THIS MORNING.
STORMS CONTINUE IN THE SOUTH. THAT'S THE BIGGEST STORY. AS WE GO TO THE NEXT FEW DAYS
IN TERMS OF THE WEATHER, WE HAVE A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND
STORMS AND SOME ILL BE HEAVY. AS WE LOOK TOWARD FRIDAY, SOUTH
THESE STORMS CONTINUING. YOU CAN SEE THE GREEN ON THE
MAP. PORTIONS OF TEXAS INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. THE SOUTHEAST ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST. ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE
OHIO VALLEY. THE NORTHEAST, NEW ENGLAND WITH A SATURDAY STUNNER. MONSOON MOISTURE THROUGH THE
FOUR CORNERS. SUNNY SKIES IN THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST. ON SUNDAY, SHOWERS AND STORMS CONTINUE TO THAT SOUTHEAST. YOU MAY NEED YOUR UMBRELLA FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. WE'VE HAD THE LAST FEW DAYS
BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN THE THEME. THE RAIN EXTENDS THROUGH PARTS
OF THE OHIO VALLEY AND THE UPPER MIDWEST, MIDWEST INTO THE
NORTHERN PLAINS.
WE COULD SEE POCKETS OF HEAVY RAIN ALONG THE GULF COAST INTO THE SOUTHEAST AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RISK OF
FLOODING AND FLASH FLOODING FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHEAST. A HEAT WAVE THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS. LOTS OF SUNSHINE IN THE WEST
AND SUNSHINE ON SUNDAY THROUGH NEW ENGLAND. THE LAST WEEK IN JULY LOOKING NICE IN THE NORTHEAST. UNSETTLED SOUTH IS THE HIGHLIGHT. WE ARE LOOKING AT REDS, ORANGES
AND YELLOWS WHICH IS HEAVY
RAIN. THAT'S WHY WE ARE CONCERNED FOR FLOODING ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN TEXAS, WESTERN LOUISIANA AND ALONG THE GULF COAST INTO THE SOUTHEAST. YOU CAN SEE SOME FLOODING IN
THE CAROLINAS AND FLASH FLOODING. WE DO HAVE FLOOD ALERTS. 10 MILLION PEOPLE IMPACTED WE SEE THE GREEN. LET'S START IN THE CAROLINAS.
MYRTLE BEACH, NEW BERN AND PARTS OF TEXAS. LUFKIN, VICTORIA, CORPUS CHRISTI. YOU SEE THOSE RED SHAPES. THOSE ARE FLASH FLOODING POTS.
YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL HEADING OUT ON THIS FRIDAY. THERE'S THE FLASH FLOOD RISK. THIS IS WHERE WE'RE EXPECTING HEAVY RAIN FROM HOUSTON INTO
THE CAROLINAS. THIS IS WHY. A LOT OF RAIN OF THE NEXT FEW
DAYS. THIS IS THROUGH SATURDAY ESPECIALLY WE SEE THOSE DARKER COLORS. UMBRELLAS AND MAYBE MOVIE DAYS
WILL BE THE THEME WATCHING THE OLYMPICS. >> YOU'VE GOT THE OLYMPICS ALL THE TIME. EVEN SOME SPORTS YOU DIDN'T
KNOW WERE PART OF THE OLYMPICS. YOU CAN WATCH IT ALL. >>> MUCH MORE TO COME INCLUDING OUR CONTINUING COUNTDOWN TO THE

CARRIERS. WE ARE LIVE OUTSIDE LAGUARDIA WITH MORE ON THIS. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ? >> Reporter: IT'S HARD TO
IMAGINE SOUTHWEST WITHOUT THAT MAD DASH TO FIND THE BEST SEAT
THAT WOULD THRILL SOME AND STRESS OTHERS OUT. SOUTHWEST CEO HAS SAID URGENT CHANGE IS NEEDED AMID A PLUNGING PROFITS AND HE BELIEVES THEY CAN WIN BACK

SAFETY INCIDENTS.
AMID STIFF, PETITION WITH AIRLINES LOOKING TO FILL SEATS, SOUTHWEST BETTING ON THIS NEW BUSINESS MODEL TO LIFT OFF.

EXPECTS PREMIER AND ASSIGNED SEATING TO BECOME AVAILABLE AT SOME POINT NEXT YEAR. ONE THIRD OF THE PLANE WILL OFFER THAT EXTRA LEGROOM.
THE EXACT DESIGN LAYOUT IS STILL UNDERWAY. IT WILL REQUIRE FAA APPROVAL.
AS FOR THE SAFETY REVIEW THAT I MENTIONED, SOUTHWEST SAYS IT'S WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE
FEDERAL AGENCY AND NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SAFETY OF ITS EMPLOYEES AND PASSENGERS. >> I LOVE FLYING SOUTHWEST WHEN I LIVED IN L.A.
NEAR THE BURBANK AIRPORT. I AGREE THE ANXIETY OF GETTING THAT SEAT WAS BOTHERSOME.
>> IT WAS STRESSFUL. >>> A POWERFUL TYPHOON HAS MADE
LANDFALL IN TAIWAN. CLAUDIO LAVANGA HAS THAT ANOTHER WORLD NEWS.
GOOD MORNING. PORT CO GOOD MORNING, JOE.
TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AFTER THE ISLAND WAS HIT BY A POWERFUL TYPHOON.
THE TYPHOON HAS BEEN CONSIDERED AS POWERFUL AS A CATEGORY THREE
HURRICANE. WINDS UP TO 125 MILES PER HOUR, HEAVY RAINFALL AND DANGEROUS STORM SURGES. A WOMAN WAS TRAPPED BY A TREE
WHILE RIDING ON A MOTORCYCLE AND A WOMAN HIT BY A POWER
POLL. LET'S GO TO UKRAINE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE LEFT WITHOUT POWER AFTER RUSSIA
ATTACKED ENERGY FACILITIES IN TWO REGIONS. THE GOVERNOR OF ONE OF THE
REGIONS AFFECTED SAID 15 PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED IN THE ATTACK. OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS,
RUSSIA HAS ATTACKED ENERGY FACILITIES ACROSS UKRAINE WITH MISSILES AND DRONES CAUSING BLACKOUTS IN MANY REGIONS.
LET'S END IN ARE STILL WERE A FEDERAL COURT HALTED THE
PROJECT TO PAVE A DIRT HIGHWAY IN THE AMAZON FOREST ARGUING IT COULD LEAD TO CLIMATE CHANGE.
THE 560 MILE HIGHWAY CONNECTS MANY REGIONS. HALF OF THE LENGTH IS UNPAVED
AND BECOMES IMPASSABLE DURING THE RAINY SEASON KEEPING FOREST CUTTERS WAY. THE PEN TO PAVE IT WAS APPROVED
IN 2022 BUT IT HAS BEEN STOP BY
A PROSECUTOR WHO ARGUES THE PROJECT LACKS THE PLAN TO DETER THE FOR STATION. >> THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP, A TRIP BACK DOWN
TO EARTH REMAINS UP IN THE AIR FOR THOSE TWO STAR LINER ASTRONAUTS ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.
HITCHED. >> DO YOU SEE OURSELVES IN SPACE ? >> I FEEL GREAT. STAY TUNED NOW ON WEEKNIGHTS AT
8:00. >>> WE ARE BACK WITH THE STAR LINER SPACECRAFT AND THE TWO
ASTRONAUTS ON BOARD. THEY'VE HAD TO SPEND MUCH LONGER TIME AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FOLLOWING TECH ISSUES WITH THAT
SPACECRAFT. JESSIE KIRSCH HAS THE LATEST.
>> Reporter: MORE THAN 50 DAYS AFTER STAR LINERS LIFT OFF,
THIS MORNING THERE'S NO RETURN DATE FOR THE BOEING SPACECRAFT OR ITS CREW. >> WHERE MAKING GREAT PROGRESS BUT WE ARE NOT READY TO DO
THAT. >> Reporter: ASTRONAUTS WILL STAY ABOARD THE INTERNATIONAL
SPACE STATION AS NASA AND BOEING TROUBLESHOOT ISSUES.
>> ONE DID NOT PERFORM WELL. >> Reporter: THEY BELIEVE IN THE FORM THRUSTER FAILED.
MORE TESTING IS AHEAD ON WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A WEEK LONG ISS VISIT INTO AN ORDEAL
LASTING MUCH LONGER. >> I'VE BEEN APPEARED BEFORE IT FEELS LIKE COMING HOME.
>> Reporter: THE ASTRONAUTS SPEAKING WITH REPORTERS. EVEN BORROWING CLOTHES FROM CREW MEMBERS ON THE ISS BECAUSE THEIR LUGGAGE WAS LEFT BEHIND
TO MAKE ROOM FOR ISS TOILET FIXING EQUIPMENT. >> IT'S GREAT TO BE UP HERE.
>> Reporter: BOEING STARLINER IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER BUDGET AND YEARS BEHIND
SCHEDULE. >> HOLDS, HOLDS. >> Reporter: THE SPACE X DRAGON, STAR LINER IS SUPPOSED TO SUPPORT LOWER ORBIT TRAVEL
SO NASA CAN FOCUS ON DEEP SPACE
MISSIONS. STAR LINERS FIRST GROUP MISSION FINALLY TOOK OFF LAST MONTH BEFORE THE FIRST ISSUES.
OFFICIALS WANT TO TEST FIRE TWO DOZEN THRUSTERS WHILE THE SPACECRAFT IS DOCKED TO THE
ISS. NASA WANTS TO CONDUCT AN AGENCY REVIEW WHICH WILL NOT WRAP UP
UNTIL LATE NEXT -- NEXT WEEK
AND IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THE ASTRONAUTS WOULD GET HOME IF STAR LINE IS NOT USED FOR THE RETURN JOURNEY. >> NASA HAS OPTIONS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON BRINGING
BUTCH AND SUNNY HOME. >> Reporter: LET'S GET TO OUR FORMER NASA -- NASA ASTRONAUT.
MIKE, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. OFFICIALS BELIEVE A DEFORMED
THRUSTER SEAL WAS TO BLAME FOR THIS ISSUE. HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS AND WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS IT CAN CAUSE.
>> THEY EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM IS THEY WERE TALKING TO THE SPACE STATION THEY THEY HAD FIVE THRUSTERS FAILED.
THEY RAN TESTS ON THE VEHICLE AND FOUR OF THOSE THRUSTERS CAME BACK.
THEY ARE DOWN ONE WHICH IS OKAY
BECAUSE THEY HAVE 27 OF 28. THRUSTERS ON BOARD ARE IN GOOD SHAPE.
THEY'VE BEEN ABLE THROUGH TESTING TO RE-CREATE THE
PROBLEM UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS THAT WERE EXPERIENCED ON ORBIT THEY WERE
ABLE TO RE-CREATE THAT PROBLEM. THE DEFORMED SEAL IS WHAT THEY FOUND. THAT'S A GOOD THING. RE-CREATING THE PROBLEMS HE COULD STUDY IT AND FIX IT IS A
GOOD THING. IT'S A GOOD SIGN. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS SO IT DOESN'T
HAPPEN AGAIN. THEY ARE MOVING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. THE CREW IS FINE. I HEARD THE WORD ORDEAL USE. I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AN ORDEAL.
THEY ARE PROBABLY ENJOYING THEIR EXTRA TIME UP THERE IN A GOOD THING IN THAT REGARD.
EVENTUALLY, THEY NEED TO COME HOME. IF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM, THAT'S A GOOD THING AND A GOOD SIGN. THAT WILL GIVE US THE
CONFIDENCE TO BRING THEM HOME. >> I DETECT JEALOUSY IN YOUR VOICE. >> YEAH. I WOULD NOT MIND BEING UP
THERE. >> HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE ?
>> I DON'T THINK THEY KNOW. SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE GETTING CLOSER TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A RUSH TO BRING THEM HOME.
THERE'S PLENTY OF SUPPLIES ON BOARD FOR THEM. THE MORE DATA THEY CAN COLLECT THE BETTER.
THE PROPULSION UNIT DOES NOT RETURN TO EARTH. WITH THE THRUSTERS THEY ARE
STUDYING, THEY WILL NOT GET THOSE BACK. THAT THE CREW AND CREW MODULE BACK BUT THE OTHER PART IS
SEPARATING AND BURNING UP DURING
REENTRY. THIS IS THE ONLY CHANCE THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT IT. THIS IS A TEST FLIGHT. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND DOING
TESTS AND CHECKING THINGS. THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM WORKS. THE NEXT FLIGHT WILL BE AN
OPERATIONAL FLIGHT WERE THEY WILL BE PUTTING PAYING
CUSTOMERS ON BOARD. AS WELL AS NASA ASTRONAUTS. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE
SYSTEM WORKS. I THINK THEY ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. THEY SAID THEY HAVE OTHER
OPTIONS. IF THEY LOSE CONFIDENCE, THEY HAVE OTHER OPTIONS TO GET THE CREW HOME. THEY ARE SITTING OKAY. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, I
DON'T KNOW. MAYBE A FEW MORE WEEKS. >> THANK YOU, MIKE. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
