BUT SHE MAKES IT LOOK EASY.
>> IT IS ALMOST LIKE SHE'S THE
ONLY PERSON IN THE POOL.
WE WILL GET TO THAT, BUT WE
START WITH BREAKING NEWS ON THE
ECONOMY.
>>> THIS NEWS COULD HAVE BIG
IMPACT ON YOUR WALLET.
THE FEDERAL RESERVE DID
ANNOUNCE THEY ARE HOLDING
INTEREST RATES STEADY.
FOR A YEAR THE BENCHMARK RATE
HAS REMAINED AT A 23 YEAR HIGH
BUT A CUT COULD BE COMING SOON.
JUST NOT TODAY.
JOINING US NOW WITH THE LATEST,
NBC NEWS BUSINESS AND DATA
CORRESPONDENT BRIAN CHEUNG.
BRIAN, THIS IS NOT A MAJOR
SURPRISE.
YOU HAVE BEEN TELLING US FOR
MONTHS AN INTEREST RATE MIGHT
HAPPEN IN SEPTEMBER.
I DON'T THINK YOU EVER SAID
JULY.
IS THAT STILL THE THINKING?
>> YES, AND THAT NEXT MEETING
IS THE NEXT TIME WE WILL GET A
DECISION SO IT MAY NOT BE LONG
FROM NOW WE WILL GET THAT
INTEREST RATE CUT BUT ON THE
CALENDAR WE'VE GOT ANOTHER SIX
TO EIGHT WEEKS TO GET THAT.
THE ANNOUNCEMENT DROPPED TWO
MINUTES AGO.
THE FEDERAL RESERVE SAYING IT
HAS NOT CUT INTEREST RATES.
IT IS KEEPING INTEREST RATES
WHERE THEY ARE BUT THEY HAVE
SEEN SIGNS OF PROGRESS.
IN RECENT MONTHS THERE HAS BEEN
SOME FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARDS
THE COMMITTEE'S 2% INFLATION
OBJECTIVE AND I BRING THAT UP
BECAUSE THAT IS THE BIG STORY
IN THIS ECONOMY.
THE HIGH-PRICED TAX WE HAVE
BEEN NOTICING AT THE STORE.
THE FEDERAL RESERVE SAYS WITH
THE RATE OF INFLATION COMING
DOWN CLOSER TO 3% AS OF RECENT
MEASURES COMPARED TO 9% AT THE
PEAK OF THE SUMMER OF 2022,
THAT IS GOOD PROGRESS BUT THE
FEDERAL RESERVE HAS BEEN SAYING
WHY IS INFLATION GOING
SIDEWAYS?
IT IS HOVERING AROUND 3% FOR
BASICALLY THE ENTIRETY OF 2024.
OTHER READINGS HAVE BEEN MORE
ENCOURAGING TO THEM.
THIS STATEMENT THEY JUST
RELEASED SEEMS TO CODIFY THAT
BUT THEY ARE SAYING CLEARLY THE
COMMITTEE DOES NOT EXPECT IT
WILL BE APPROPRIATE TO REDUCE
THE TARGET RANGE, A.K.A.
A CUT, UNTIL THEY GAIN FURTHER
CONFIDENCE.
WILL THEY GET THAT BY
SEPTEMBER?
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE WATCHING
FOR NOT JUST IN THE COMING
WEEKS BUT IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR
WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE CHAIRMAN
IN A PRESS CONFERENCE.
>> BRIAN, ASSUMING A CUT DOES
COME IN THE FALL AND SEPTEMBER,
WHAT SHOULD WE BE PREPARING FOR
WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SAVINGS ON
CARS AND HOMES?
>> INTEREST RATES HAVE NOT BEEN
CHANGED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE
IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO SO WHEN
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO
BE AWARE OF, SAVINGS IS A BIG
STORY HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN
GETTING PRETTY DECENT SAVINGS
RATES IF YOU ARE WILLING TO
KEEP YOUR MONEY AT THE BANK FOR
12 TO 18 MONTHS, YOU ARE
GETTING RATES AROUND 5% BUT IF
THE FED CUTS INTEREST RATES,
THE BANKS WHICH LIKE TO CHANGE
THE RATE THEY PAY OUT BASED ON
WHAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS
DOING, THAT COULD GO DOWN, SO
YOU MIGHT GET LESS SAVINGS ON
THOSE ACCOUNTS IF YOU WAIT
UNTIL SEPTEMBER, SO SOME ADVICE
BASED ON FINANCIAL EXPERTS WE
