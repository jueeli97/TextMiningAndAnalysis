AFTER THEY WON. THAT IS LATER IN THE SHOW. HEY, THERE, I'M HALLIE. DEMOCRATS ARE GETTING CLOSER TO
A PRESIDENTIAL TICKET. A FULL TICKET AS THE VICE PRESIDENT IS SET TO HIT THE TRAIL. SAYING LATE TODAY SHE HAS NOT
MADE UP HER MIND YET ON WHO HER RUNNINGMATE MIGHT BE. THERE SHE IS. THAT IS WHERE SHE SAID THE
COMMENTS. TELLING NBC NEWS THAT HAIRIS AND HER PICK, WHO WILL BE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ONE OF THESE MEN
HERE, WILL BE HEADING THROUGH TO SWING THROUGH BATTLEGROUND STATES TOGETHER NEXT WEEK. IT TRACKS WITH OUR TIMING HERE.
GOING TO MAKE THE PICK BY AUGUST 7th. TONIGHT, MAKING HER FIRST TRIP
TO GEORGIA AS THE LIKELY DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND. HOPING TO WIN OVER YOUNGER
BLACK VOTERS AND REENERGIZE. TO DO IT, THEY ARE BRINGING IN MEGAN THEE STALLION AND RUNNING
TRUMP AND HIS RUNNINGMATE WILL HEAD TO ATLANTA TO CAMPAIGN THIS WEEKEND. SAME PLACE, DIFFERENT TIME.
YOU SEE IT HERE. TRUMP/VANCE BLITZ. WE GOT IT COVERED.
GOT PENNSYLVANIA AND YOU GO TO ATLANTA. YOU ARE THERE, GIVE US A SENSE OF THE VIBE AND THE
EXPECTATIONS FROM HARRIS. NOT LIKELY SHE WILL NAME HER VPP
THERE [BAD AUDIO ]
-- WHAT I AM HEARING FROM PEOPLE IS SHE WILL STILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT
SHE FINDS ARE MOST IMPORTANT. AND ISSUES ABOUT THE CRIME. SHE WILL DEAL WITH THEM IN A
SOFT ISSUE WAY. MEANING THEY WILL NOT ROLL OUT THE POLICY GO CHECK MY WEBSITE. SHE SAYS I WILL MAKE YOU FEEL
BETTER AND YOU WILL HAVE A COUNTRY THAT YOU WILL FEEL
BETTER IN. [BROKEN AUDIO ]
. >> Reporter: I EXPECT HER TO ATTACK TRUMP, SHE HAS BEEN DOING THAT. CALLING HIM A FRAUDSTER AND A CHEATER AND SOMEONE THAT CAN
NOT BE TRUSTED.
WE EXPECT HER TO LEAN IN.
. >> WE ARE PLAYING AUDIO ROULETTE IF YOU WILL, YOU ARE IN, YOU ARE OUT. I IMAGINE YOUR MIC IS TAKING
HITS BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE CELL PHONES THERE. WE WILL COME BACK, THANK YOU. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
POLITICAL AISLE, HARRIS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE HER RUNNINGMATE IN A WEEK OR EIGHT DAYS OR SO. YOU HAVE DEVELOPMENTS IN AN
ATTACK THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN LEVELING AGAINST TRUMP AND J.D. VANCE. WE ARE LIVE IN THE BATTLEGROUND
OF PENNSYLVANIA. IT HAS TO DO WITH PROJECT 2025. VIEWERS OF OUR SHOW WILL KNOW
ABOUT THAT. WE TALKED ABOUT IT. CREATED BY A BLUEPRINT CREATED
BY THIS RIGHT-LEANING THINK TANK. THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION AND DEMOCRATS SAID IT IS SIMPLY TOO
EXTREME. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DISTANCED ITSELF OR TRIED TO FROM IT. WALK US THROUGH THE DYNAMICS HERE.
THEY ARE WINDING DOWN THEIR POLICY WORK, SO TO SPEAK, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? >> Reporter: HALLIE, THAT
EXACTLY RIGHT. THEIR LEADER IS STEPPING DOWN IN THE WAKE OF THE FORMER
PRESIDENT REALLY TRYING TO CREATE THAT DISTANCE CRITICIZING THE PROJECT AND THE
GROUP BEHIND IT DEMOCRATS REALLY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TIE
TRUMP AND PROJECT 2025 TOGETHER. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS THINK IT IS TOO EXTREME AND MOST AMERICANS
WILL REJECT THE PROPOSALS. THEY WANT TO REALLY LINK TRUMP AND THAT PROJECT. HE IS TRYING TO DISTANCE HIMSELF AND NOW IN THE WAKE OF
THE LEADER STEPPING DOWN AND THEM SAYING THEY ARE WINDING DOWN THEIR POLICY WORK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS SAYING THEIR
DEMISE WOULD BE GREATLY WELCOMED AND IT SHOULD SERVE AS NOTICE TO ANY OTHERS WHO ARE
CLAIMING THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. HE CALLED THEM DRIFTERS, TRYING TO SEPARATE THEMSELVESES FROM THEIR WORK. EVEN THOUGH SOME OF HIS FORMER
STAFF WAS A PART OF THE PROJECT. A SOURCE SAYING THEY ARE NOT SHUTTING DOWN AND THE PROJECT
ITSELF SAYING THAT THEY HAVE BUILT A TOOL FOR ANY FUTURE ADMINISTRATION TO USE. SO, THEY ARE SAYING WE ARE
STILL OUT THERE. IF TRUMP DOES NOT WANT IT, FINE, IT IS HERE FOR OTHER
REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS TO PUT INTO EFFECT, HALLIE? >> THERE IS ALSO J.D. VANCE HOLDING CAMPAIGN EVENTS OF HIS OWN TODAY.
HE AND TRUMP HAVE BEEN ON DEFENSE FOR SOME OF WHICH YOU TALKED ABOUT AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS ON THAT FRONT AS
WELL? >> Reporter: YEAH, THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS CAMPAIGN ON DEFENSE AFTER AN
INTERVIEW. I JUST WANT YOU TO TAKE A LISTEN SO YOU HAVE THE CONTEXT FOR THIS AND I WILL TALK ABOUT
THEIR RESPONSE ON THE OTHER SIDE. >> THEY TELL ME THAT THIS
HARRIS'HUSBAND IS JEWISH, HE IS JEWISH LIKE BERNIE SANDERS IS
JEWISH, HE IS A HORRIBLE JEW. >> OBVIOUSLY CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
TAKING HEAT FOR IT. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATION DIRECTOR SAYING IN A STATEMENT. HE OBVIOUSLY WASN'T AGREEING
WITH THAT STATEMENT.
STOP TAKING TALKING POINTS AND TRANSCRIPTS FROM THE KAMALA FOLKS. >> AND A DUELING AD BLITZ.
BOTH ARE SPENDING MONEY ON THEIR FIRST TV AD BUYS OF THIS
LET'S CALL IT NEW CAMPAIGN.
NO LONGER BIDEN/TRUTHTRUMP AND
NOW HARRIS/TRUMP. THE HARRIS TEAM LOOKING TO HIGH LIKE HER BACKGROUND. THE TRUMP TEAM LOOKING TO GO AT
HARRIS ON IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER. IT TELLS YOU WHERE EACH CAMPAIGN SEES STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
>> THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. I THINK IF YOU LIVE IN A STATE LIKE PENNSYLVANIA WE ARE
OFFICIALLY IN THAT ZONE. IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID THE CAMPAIGN ADS FROM HERE ON
OUT UNTIL NOVEMBER. $50 MILLION FROM THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN ON THAT AD. IT IS CALLED FEARLESS LEADER.
TALKING UP HER BIO AND HER BACKGROUND. ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE BIGGEST LINE OF ATTACK THAT HAS BEEN USED BY THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SO
FAR. THEY ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH LINES AND MESSAGING, REALLY, THEY ARE FOCUSED ON IMMIGRATION AS A KEY TOPIC.
SOMETHING THEY FEEL THE FORMER PRESIDENT DOES WELL ON AND
SOMETHING THEY THINK IS A VULNERABILITY. GOING AFTER HARRIS, SHE FAILED AS THE BORDER CZAR AND THAT IS WHAT THE AD IS REALLY FOCUSED
ON AND THAT IS LARGELY THE MESSAGE THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
AND WATCHING AS THAT DEVELOPS
HERE. >> THANK YOU. >>> A MAJOR CHANGE FROM THE ACTIVE HEAD OF SERVICE. HE IS A SHAMED AND CAN NOT
DEFEND THE SECURITY FAILURES IN THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT. THINGS GOT, WELL, PRETTY
INTENSE, LISTEN. >> NOTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE UNTIL SOMEBODY LOSES THEIR JOB. >> BY ALL ACCOUNTS THIS WAS A
INEXCUSABLE SECURITY AND PLANNING FAILURE. >> WHAT WERE YOU NEEDING TO INVESTIGATE TO KNOW THERE WERE
CRITICAL ENOUGH FAILURE THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS OUGHT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
>> SENATOR, THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND . >> WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?
>> BLACK HOLE, YOU LOSE THE SUPPORT OF AMERICAN PUBLIC BECAUSE PEOPLE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE BEING DIRECT WITH THEM
>> THE ACTING DIRECTOR SAYS HOW COMMUNICATION BROKE DOWN BETWEEN LOCAL POLICE AND THE SECRET SERVICE THAT DAY.
NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE GUNMAN AS WELL. THE SHOOTER MAY HAVE HAD A
SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT THAT POSTED ANTIIMMIGRANT VIEWS AND YOU HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THIS. A LOT OF DEVELOPMENTS, THIS
HEARING FROM THE ONE THAT THE PREVIOUS HEAD OF THE SECRET SERVICE WHO SINCE STEPPED DOWN
HAD A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. >> Reporter: THAT IS RIGHT,
HALLIE. THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE SINCE THE ONSET, THE MORE QUESTIONS THAT
WE EVENTUALLY HAVE. THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH TODAY. THERE IS A KEY 30 SECOND GAP
HERE BETWEEN WHAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT KNEW ABOUT THE SHOOTER AND WHAT THE SECRET SERVICE DID OR WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING WITH THE SHOOTER.
AND I THINK IF WE CAN LISTEN FOR JUST A SECOND THE ACTING
DIRECTOR OF THE SECRET SERVICE EXPLAIN THE EVENTS OF THAT AND I WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT KEY 30 SECONDS >> I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT
THAT BASED ON WHAT I KNOW RIGHT NOW, NEITHER THE SECRET SERVICE
COUNTERTEAMS OR MEMBERS OF THE FORMER SECURITY DETAIL HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS A MAN ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING
WITH A FIREARM. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THOSE PERSONNEL WERE NOT AWARE THE
ASSAILANT HAD A FIREARM UNTIL THEY HEARD GUNSHOTS. PRIOR TO THAT THEY WERE
ACKNOWLEDGING WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT LOCAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT WAS WORKING THE ISSUE OF A SUSPICIOUS PERSON PRIOR TO SHOTS. >> ACCORDING TO HIM, THERE WAS A 30 SECOND GAP BETWEEN LOCAL
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND YOU REMEMBER OUR REPORTING ON THIS. THEY PHYSICALLY SEE THE SHOOTER, TOMAS CROOKS ON THE
ROOF WITH A RIFLE. THEY ARE CLIMBING ON THE ROOF AND THEY HAVE TO GET DOWN. THEY RADIO IT IN, INTO THE SAME
COMMAND POST WHERE THE SECRET SERVICE IS, MAN ON THE ROOF WITH A GUN AND THEN 30 SECONDS
LATER SLOTS ARE FIRED. THAT IS A KEY QUESTION, WHO TOLD WHAT AND WHEN AND WHY SOMETHING WAS NOT ACTED ON
SOONER. IT IS ONLY 30 SECONDS BUT IT IS 30 SECONDS. SO, I THINK THAT IS JUST GOING TO LEAD TO AS I ALLUDED TO MORE
QUESTIONS HERE AS THE QUESTION GOES FORWARD. >> THERE IS ALSO THIS EXCLUSIVE
INTERVIEW WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND IN WHICH THIS CAME UP. LET ME HAVE YOU TALK US THROUGH THAT. I KNOW WE WILL SEE MORE ON THAT
ON NIGHTLY BUT HEADLINES THERE. >> Reporter: YES, A COUPLE HEADLINES ON THAT, OBVIOUSLY,
DISCUSSIONS HERE AS FAR AS MOTIVE. WE HEARD FROM THE FBI TODAY, THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR TALKING
ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION THE WORK THAT YOU SAW THERE ON THE ROOF. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH RESPECT TO WHO THE FBI HAS SPOKE TONE
AND HOW MANY AGENTS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED. ONE OF THE THINGS THEY SAY THEY
FOUND BACK TO SOMETHING YOU MENTIONED EARLIER IS THE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT GOING BACK TO 2019, 2020, THEY SAY IF THAT
SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT IS CONFIRMED TO BELONG TO CROOKS,
THE SHOOTER, HE SHOWN ANTICEMETTIC VIEWS, ADVOCATED FOR POLITICAL VIOLENCE, HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS EXTREME VIEWS.
SO, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE FBI DISCUSSES. AS FAR AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
THE COUNTRY'S TOP LAWMAN FEDERALLY, HE TALKED ABOUT HIS REAL CONCERNS WITH THE SHOOTING
TODAY. >> HOW ALARMED ARE YOU THAT A 20-YEAR-OLD WAS ABLE TO GET A
CLEAR SHOT, 150 YARDS FROM A FORMER PRESIDENT. >> THIS IS ALARMING. OUR DEMOCRACY WILL NOT DECIDE
IF PEOPLE DECIDE THE WAY THEY WHICH OUTCOMES THEY WANT OR OTHER MOTIVE HE MIGHT HAVE IS BY KILLING SOMEONE THAT IS WHY
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE, WHY IT HAPPENED AND MAKE SURE IT DOES NOT
HAPPEN AGAIN. >> Reporter: THE SECRET SERVICE DOES NOT REPORT TO HIM, THEY REPORT TO HOMELAND SECURITY.
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING INTO WHAT AGENCIES ARE UNDER HIM TO SEE WHAT THEY
COULD HAVE DONE TO BETTER ASSIST THE SECRET SERVICE. AT THIS POINT, THERE IS MORE OF A QUESTION FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
AND DHS. >> QUESTION TOM, WHAT WILL CHANGE IF ANYTHING THIS
ELECTION SEASON. IN OTHER WORDS, ANY STATEMENT TO TIGHTEN WHAT THEY
ACKNOWLEDGED SECURITY GAPS, A VICE PRESIDENT AND SHE WILL HAVE HER RUNNINGMATE? >> Reporter: BY THE TIME WE GET
THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IN A COUPLE WEEKS TIME THIS WILL ALL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT. I MEAN AS YOU I AND KNOW OVER
THE PAST 10 YEARS OR SO, CANDIDATES CRISSCROSSED THE COUNTRY TRYING TO GET UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH VOTERS, A LOT
MORE SMALLER EVENTS AND THE TYPE OF EVENTS WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO THESE RURAL COUNTIES
IN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU HAVE PENNSYLVANIA OBVIOUSLY, KEY, WISCONSIN OTHER AREAS WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO
REACH OUT TO RURAL VOTERS, TOO, IN AN ELECTION THIS MUCH OF A NARROW MARGIN BETWEEN THE TWO
CANDIDATES TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE ENGAGED AND VOTING FOR THEM AS POSSIBLE. THE QUESTION WILL BE, WHAT WILL
BECOME OF THESE RALLIES IN THESE PLACES THAT ARE CAMPGROUNDS AND FAIRGROUNDS THE
TYPE OF WHICH WE ARE LOOKING AT ON SCREEN AND HOW WILL THEY BE ABLE TO SECURE THOSE, THESE
TYPE OF RALLYING BE ALLOWED TO GO ON OR LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT FROM HERE ON OUT? IT IS A QUESTION OF WHEN THE
SECRET SERVICE IS LOOKING HARD AT. >> TOM WINTER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE MENTIONED THE INTERVIEW WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL AIR
IN FULL OR AT LEAST MORE OF IT ON NIGHTLY WITH LESTER HOLT.
>>> TONIGHT, OVERSEAS, NEW DETAILS AFTER A MOMENT THE WORLD HAD BEEN WAITING FOR.
ISRAELI RETALIATION AGAINST HEZBOLLAH. A NEW STRIKE RIGHT NEAR THE CAPITOL OF BAY ROUTE.
ISRAEL CLAIMING TO KILLED A TOP COMMANDER IN RERESPONSE TO
SATURDAY'S ATTACK THAT KILLED TEENS. YOU CAN SEE THE DEBRIS ALL OVER THE STREET. FIRST RESPONDERS TRYING TO GET
A HANDLE ON IT. ONE WOMAN KILLED, 70 OTHER PEOPLE HURT. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THE
COMMANDER HAD AMERICAN BLOOD ON HIS HANDS. ALLEGING HE IS NOT ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WEEKEND
ROCKET ATTACK BUT A 1983 BOMBING THAT KILLED AMERICAN SERVICE MEMBERS.
THIS IS A MOMENT THAT THE WORLD IN SO MANY WAYS WAS HOLDING ITS BREATH FOR AFTER THAT ATTACK ON
SATURDAY. THE ISRAELI'S SAID THEY WILL SEEK RETALIATION. HERE NOW IT HAS COME OUT.
>> Reporter: THIS COULD BE IT. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. THAT IS THE THING THAT EVERYONE IS STILL WAITING. THE WORLD IS STILL WAITING FOR
MORE. THEY ARE WAITING TO SEE IF ISRAEL WILL BE SATISFIED, THIS IS THIS MASSIVE ATTACK THEY
HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE HEARD A LOT OF RHETORIC FROM
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ON DOWN DESCRIBING HOW THEY ARE GOING
TO RETALIATE AGAINST HEZBOLLAH. IF IT IS, THIS IS NOT LAYING THEM DOWN. THIS IS PRETTY LIMITED.
IT IS PRETTY TARGETED. YOU MENTIONED A LOT OF CASUALTIES AMONG THE INJURIES, BUT, THIS COULD MEAN THERE IS
STILL MORE TO COME. IT ALSO COULD MEAN THERE IS MORE TO COME ON THE HEZBOLLAH
SIDE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THAT AS WELL. HOW WILL THEY RESPOND TO THIS
RETALIATION. WILL THEY RETALIATE? WILL THEY INTRODUCE A POSSIBILITY OF A REGION WAR? WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS
FOR MONTHS. THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. WHETHER OR NOT IRAN WILL ENTER
INTO A CONFLICT WITH HEZBOLLA H AND IF IRAN COMES IN, THE ALLY,
THE UNITED STATES THAT PARKED A LOT OF ASSETS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IF THEY WILL
ENTER THE WAR. THAT WILL RISK BRINGING IN THE WHOLE MIDDLE EAST INCLUDING COUNTRIES LIKE THE UNITED
STATES AND OTHER ISRAELI ALLIES, OTHER ARAB STATES AND OTHER STATES OR GROUPS THAT ARE
BENEFICIARIES OF IRANIAN AREAS. SO, YES, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THIS IS WHAT WE WERE ALL WAITING FOR. LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE OVER.
IF IT IS NOT THERE STILL COULD BE A LOT MORE BLOOD TO BE SHED
HERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST. >> MATT BRADLEY LIVE FOR US IN
BAY ROUTE, BEIRUT, MATT, THANK YOU. >>> NOW, A STABBING ATTACK THAT LEFT THREE CHILDREN DEAD.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE SCENE HERE. BIG CROWD HERE, WE GOT POLICE
OFFICERS, YOU HAVE THOSE YELLOW POLICE VANS WITH OFFICIALS SAYING DEMONSTRATORS WERE
THROWING BOTTLES, DAMAGING POLICE CARS, SETTING ONE ON FIRE, THEY SAY. ALL OF IT COMING AS WE ARE
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE VICTIMS. 6-YEAR-OLD BEBE KING, 7-YEAR
OLD ELSIE AND 9-YEAR-OLDALIS. THEY WERE AT A TAYLOR SWIFT
THEMED DANCE PARTY. A 17-YEAR-OLD MAN WALKED INTO THE BUILDING AND STARTED
STABBING PEOPLE WITH A KNIFE. SWIFT, SAYING SHE IS IN SHOCK. STILL TAKING IN THE HORROR.
THESE WERE JUST LITTLE KIDS AT A DANCE CLASS, I AM AT A COMPLETE LOSS FOR HOW TO EVER
CONVEY MY SYMPATHIES TO THESE FAMILIES. >> A NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENTS HERE TODAY. CAN WE START OFF WITH THESE
DEMONSTRATIONS? DESCRIBED AS A CLASH NEAR WHERE THIS ATTACK HAPPENED. TONIGHT WHAT IS GOING ON?
>> Reporter: YES, HORRIFIC KILLING SPREE LAST NIGHT HALLIE. TONIGHT, ANOTHER REALLY UGLY INCIDENT THAT THE POLICE ARE
INDICATING MAY BE TIED TO THAT STABBING SPREE YESTERDAY. SO, ACCORDING TO THE POLICE IN
THE AREA, A GROUP OF ESSENTIALLY PROTESTERS BEGAN HURLING OBJECTS AT A LOCAL
MOSQUE, NOT FAR FROM WHERE THE STABBING SPREE TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY. THE POLICE SAY THEY BELIEVE
THAT MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS UNREST TODAY WERE NOT EVEN FROM
THE AREA. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF THE ENGLISH DEFENSE LEAGUE. THIS IS A FAR RIGHT
ORGANIZATION KNOWN FOR ISLAMICPHOBIA. THE POLICE ARE TELLING THE MEDIA, ALL OF THE SPECULATION OF WHO THE SUSPECT IS, IS NOT
HELPING. WE ALREADY SAID HE IS A BORN IN THE U.K., DESPITE SOME OF THE RUMORS CIRCULATING ON LINE.
IN FACT, A NAME THAT HAS BEEN POSTED ON LINE THAT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE IS THE SUSPECT
ACCORDING TO THE POLICE IS FALSE. SO, YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF JUST HOW HIGH-TENSIONS ARE TONIGHT.
THE POLICE ARE SAYING, LOOK, OUR OFFICERS ALREADY HAD TO DEAL WITH A TRAGEDY LAST NIGHT. THE LAST THING THEY SHOULD BE
DEALING WITH TONIGHT IS ANOTHER INCIDENT OF UNREST. NOT EVEN FOUNDED ON REALITY. >> WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW GOING
BACK TO THE ATTACK LAST NIGHT? WE OBVIOUSLY HEARD FROM TAYLOR SWIFT, FAMILIES LIVING A SALUTE
NIGHTMARE WITH THE DEATHS OF THEIR CHILDREN. AND NEW DETAILS COMING OUT ABOUT THE SUSPECT, FILL US IN.
>> Reporter: YES, WE ARE LEARNING ACCORDING TO WITNESSES WHO SPOKEN TO LOCAL MEDIA THAT
THIS 17-YEAR-OLD SUSPECT ARRIVED AT THE INCIDENT IN A TAXICAB. APPARENTLY REFUSED TO PAY THE
DRIVER OF THAT TAXI. THERE WAS A BIT OF A BACK AND FORTH THERE PRIOR TO HIM GOING
TO THE COMMUNITY CENTER AND STABBING ALL OF THOSE YOUNG GIRLS. THIS SUSPECT IS NOT IDENTIFIED BECAUSE UNDER BRITISH LAW IF
YOU ARE UNDER AGE AS A SUSPECT YOU ARE NOT GENERALLY
IDENTIFIED BUT UNDER REALLY SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. LISTEN TO THE POLICE OFFICIAL DESCRIBING WHY THEY ARE TAKING
THIS INVESTIGATION WITH SUCH SENSITIVITY AND CARE. >> IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE
POLICE PURSUE EVERY SINGLE AVENUE. AND THAT IS WHAT THE POLICE WILL DOING.
I SUPPORT THE POLICES IN THAT WORK. YOU WILL UNDERSTAND I AM NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING THAT WILL
CUT ACROSS THEIR INVESTIGATION OR PREJUDICE THAT INVESTIGATION AS I TAKE THAT INVESTIGATION
IMMENSELY SERIOUSLY INTO THIS TRULY HORRIFIC ATTACK. >> IN THE MEANTIME, HALLIE, THE COMMUNITY IS STILL HOLDING ITS
BREATH TO SEE IF THE INCIDENT CAN GET WORSE. TODAY WE LEARNED A THIRD VICTIM HAD DIED, THERE ARE STILL EIGHT
PEOPLE WHO ARE HOSPITALIZED. MANY OF THEM IN CRITICAL CONDITION. SO, THIS COMMUNITY REALLY HOPING THAT NO MORE OF THEM
FALL VICTIM TO THEIR INJURIES AND THAT THIS INCIDENT CAN BE PUT BEHIND THEM, HALLIE?
>> JOSH LETTERMAN LIVE FOR US IN LONDON, THANK YOU. >>> TAKE YOU BACK HOME OUT
WEST. COMBINATION OF WIND, HEAT, LIGHTNING ARE SPARKING THE RISK
FOR NEW WILDFIRES AND SUPER -- SUPER SIZING THE ONES THAT ARE BURNING. THIS IS WEST OF LOVE LAND IN
COLORADO, IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, RIVERSIDE COUNTY, THESE IMAGES ARE COMING IN. PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO LEAVE HOME BECAUSE OF THE NIXON FIRE.
ALL OF IT ON TOP OF THE PARK FIRE. MASSIVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE TOP FIVE FIRES IN
THAT STATE EVER. ONE OF THE FIVE BIGGEST. THE BURNED OUT CITY OF
COHASSET. WE ARE HEARING STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO STAYED BEHIND TO SAVE THEIR OWN HOMES.
HE INSTALLED A HIGH PRESSURE PUMP AND SPRINKLERS AFTER HIS INSURANCE COMPANY DROPPED HIS
COVERAGE LAST MONTH. >> FAMILY AND FRIENDS WERE LIKE YOU GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE. I DECIDED TO STAY.
EVEN THOUGH YOU, YOU HAVE SURVIVED THE ONSLOT. WE NOW HAVE THOUSANDS OF SMALL
FIRES ALL OVER OUR PROPERTY. WE ARE GLAD WE WERE ABLE TO SAVE OUR PROPERTY IT JUST -- IT IS TOUGH. THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE PHONE
CALLS, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES.
>> NBC STEVE PATTERSON IS JOINING US NOW FROM COHASSET,
WHAT IS THE LATEST? >> IT IS A WONDER THAT ANYBODY WAS ABLE TO SAVE THEIR HOME AFTER THE FIRE CAME THROUGH HERE.
THERE IS THE WORST THAT I HAVE SEEN ON THIS FIRE. A FIRE BY THE WAY, LARGER THAN THE SIZE OF LOS ANGELES.
IT IS HALF OF THE SIZE OF RHODE ISLAND. FIREFIGHTERS FIGHTING THIS THING NOW FOR THE PAST SIX
DAYS, EXHAUSTION IS SETTING IN. 24-48 HOUR SHIFTS TRYING TO PUSH THE FLAMES BACK. I SAW A MAP TODAY, HALLIE, THAT
SHOWED EXACTLY WHERE THE FIRE IS MOVING. THEY ARE MOSTLY PUSHING IT INWARD INTO A WILDERNESS AREA.
A LOT OF IT IS PUSHING AWAY FROM CITY CENTERS. THAT IS THE GREAT NEWS, THEY
HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER WEATHER OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, THAT IS GOOD NEWS AS WELL. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET
CONTAINMENT ON IT AS WELL. 14% CONTAINMENT ALONG THE AREAS THEY NEED TO. AGAIN, PARADISE, CHICO, PLACES
THAT EXPERIENCED TRAUMA BEFORE. AND DON'T WANT TO SEE THE FLAMES AGAIN. THEY ARE NOT IN THAT AREA. ALL OF THAT IS GREAT NEWS, THE
BAD NEWS IS HOW IT FEELS NOW. THE WEATHER IS HEATING UP, IT WILL BE HOTTER, DRIER, WINDIER
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, AND THAT WILL FURTHER COMPLICATE THE EFFORT ON THE GROUND.
AGAIN, THE FIRE IT IS ENORMOUS, 380,000 ACRES. THE FIFTH LARGEST, A LOT OF
OFFICIALS THINK IT WILL BE HIGHER ON THAT LIST AND THEY COULD BE FIGHTING THIS THING
FOR MONTHS. HALLIE? >> THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS, WE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.
THIS WAS, THE OFFICIALS SAY, APPARENTLY SET ON PURPOSE BY SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN CHARGED
WITH ARSON, RIGHT? >> Reporter: 42-YEAR-OLD RONNIE SCOTT II, HE FACED THE JUDGE YESTERDAY, WE KNOW ARSON
CHARGES ARE COMING. HE WILL BE FORMALLY ARRAIGNED TOMORROW.
THE STORY IS SIMPLE. WITNESSES SAY THEY SAW HIM PUT SOMETHING INTO A CAR, THE CAR IGNITING ON FIRE AND THEN HIM
PUSHING THAT CAR INTO A RAVINE. OUR TEAM HAS BEEN TO WHERE THE SITE OF THE FIRE WAS, YOU CAN
SEE WHERE THAT AREA IS. HE IS NOW ACCORDING TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHO IS GOING TO THROW THE BOOK AT HIM.
SAYING THAT HE DID NOT DO THAT. HE DENIES EVER PUSHING THAT
CAR. HERE IS WORD FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HIMSELF.
LISTEN TO THIS. >> HE DENIES THE STATEMENT OF A WITNESS AT THE AREA.
THAT HE PUSHED HIS FLAMING CAR DOWN INTO A GULLY 60 FEET DOWN.
IT IS AT THIS POINT, A BELIEF, THAT THE EVIDENCE TENDS
STRONGER TO THE WITNESS. >> WE ALSO KNOW HE HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PRIOR
RECORD, PRIORS ON HIS RECORD, OBVIOUSLY THIS WOULD BE HIS THIRD STRIKE IF HE IS CONVICTED FOR THIS HE IS LOOKING AT LIFE
IN PRISON, HALLIE? >> STEVE PATTERSON LIVE FOR US THERE IN CALIFORNIA, THANK YOU. >>> ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
COUNTRY. RESCUE CREWS ARE STANDING BY AFTER RAIN TRIGGERED CATASTROPHIC FLASH FLOODING IN
NORTHEAST VERMONT TODAY. A ONCE IN 1,000 YEAR EVENT ACCORDING TO FORECASTERS, ABOUT
TWO DOZEN PEOPLE HAD TO BE RESCUE FRIDAY THEIR HOMES AFTER EIGHT INCHES OF RAIN CAME DOWN IN A FEW HOURS OVERNIGHT.
YOU SEE SOME OF THE WATER HERE. OBVIOUSLY MESSING UP ROADS IN A
BIG WAY, DAMAGING BRIDGES, WASHING OUT STATE ROUTE 5. ONE OF THE RIVERS THERE RISING 13 FEET. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS SAN AREA
THAT WAS ALREADY SATURATED FROM RAIN FROM HURRICANE BARREL A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WITH MORE STORMS EXPECTED TOMORROW.
WE ARE GOING TO WATCH THIS SITUATION CLOSELY. >>> WATCHING MORE HEADLINES
COMING UP IN THIS SHOW, AND TESLA AND THE NINTH RECALL OF THE YEAR.
THE SURPRISE HOOD POPPING THAT COULD EFFECTF SOMETHING BIG.
>>> SO, WE REACHED THAT POINT IN THE SHOW AND WE WILL REACH IT MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THE
COURSE OF TWO WEEKS WHERE WE ARE THRILLED TO PLAY THE ROLE
OF SPOILER. OLYMPICS SPOILER SPECIFICALLY.
>>> YES, SPOILER ALERT FOR
GYMNASTICS. THEY WON GOLD! YES.
REMEMBER, SHE WITH DREW BECAUSE OF THE TWISTIS AND YOU KNOW WHO
ELSE WAS WATCHING? SERENA, MICHAEL PHELPS. SPIKE LEE, NATALIE PORTMAN. EVERYONE DESCENDING ON THE VENUE TO WATCH THE WOMEN
COMPETE AND THEN BACK HOME,
LOOK AT THIS. WATCH PARTIES. YOUNG, UP AND COMING GYMNASTS LOOKING AT THEIR ICONS DO THEIR THING. HOW DO YOU WATCH THAT AND NOT
GET A LITTLE TEAR. IT IS A SPECIAL MOMENT. SO INCREDIBLE. >> SO TRUE. >> EVEN A PERSON WITH A COLD,
COLD HEART LIKE MINE IT SOFTENS A LITTLE, YOU KNOW [ LAUGHTER ]
>> WE TEASE EACH OTHER ON THE SHOW BUT WE CAN BOTH AGREE THAT
SIMONE BILES AMAZING, AMAZING. THE MOMENT SHE BECAME THE MOST DECORATED U.S. GYMNAST OF ALL-
TIME. SHE DESERVES IT. HER TEAMMATES STANDING TO ONE SIDE WATCHING, WAITING, AND THEN THE RESULTS CAME IN AND
JUST CELEBRATIONS AND THE STARS AND STRIPES. IT WAS WONDERFUL. IT MADE ME PROUD TO BE AMERICAN
BUT I AM NOT AMERICAN. AND JORDAN CHILES STUMBLED A
LITTLE BIT. SUNI LEE I DON'T KNOW T IS INCREDIBLE.
>> IT IS NOT OVER YET. NOW THEY WILL COMPETE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MEDALS THEY COULD
RACK UP THEIR MEDALS EVEN MORE. >> YES. SHE MIGHT GET 5 MEDALS AT THESE GAMES, WHAT A STORY THAT WOULD
BE. WHAT A COMEBACK THAT WOULD BE. SO, YEAH, WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED HERE. I GOT TO TELL YOU, THEY LOOK SO
CONFIDENT AND SO STRONG AND SO UNITED AND THEN, WHAT WAS REALLY COOL AS WELL AT THE TEAM
USA HOUSE HERE IN PARIS WAS TO SEE THE MEN'S TEAM, WON BRONZE
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2008, WATCHING, CHEERING, SENDING A MESSAGE OF SUPPORT. IT IS GREAT. A THING THAT YOU LOOK FOR IN AN
OLYMPICS >> THAT IS FOR SURE. I LOVE AT THE END, AFTER THEY WON THE GOLD YOU HAD BILES
TALKING WITH, I THINK IT WAS SUNI LEE WHICH TIKTOK THEY WERE GOING TO DO, WHAT THEY WERE
GOING TO PLAN. LOVING THE VIBE. LOVING THE VIBE, MY FAVORITE TIKTOK STAR OF THE OLYMPICS.
THAT IS THE WOMEN'S ILONA
MAHER WHO GOT THEIR FIRST GOLD,
I KNOW YOU KNOW ABOUT RUGBY.
>> I KNOW ILONA.
THAT IS IT. >> AMERICA SEEMED TO WIN TODAY. MANY WAYS IT IS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE YOU WIN AT EVERIING AND
NOW AT RUGBY. OH MY GOODNESS. NO, IT WAS GREAT, GREAT, BRONZE MEDAL. FANTASTIC. >> AND THEN LOOK AHEAD A LITTLE
BIT. >> THAT WAS MY ANALYSIS OF RUGBY FOR AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE, DID YOU LIKE THAT? I DID NOT GET INTO .
>> IT WAS PERFECT. I UNDERSTOOD IT. THAT YOU ARE NAILING IT HERE AS YOU ARE, PROUD TO BE AN
AMERICAN COME WE WILL CLIP AND
POST IN OUR PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS VERY SOON. ONE THING IS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF THE RIVER. RAINED OVER THE WEEKEND.
THE QUESTION OF THE TRIATHLON.
THE SEINE WATER THEY WILL TEST IT. YOU WILL FIND OUT IN THE
MORNING. IT IS A NAIL BITER, TENSE. JUST TO SAY, I THINK WE SAID IT
YESTERDAY, THAT THE ATHLETES THEMSELVES, THE TRIATHELETES SAY IT IS JUST PART OF IT. THEY SWIM IN OPEN WATER SO,
THEY SOMETIMES GET TOLD THEY CAN NOT SWIM AND THAT IS THE NATURE OF IT. SO, THAT IS COOL BUT STILL IT
IS TENSE BECAUSE I GOT TO TELL YOU T IS HOT HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE I
AM SWEATING A LITTLE BIT. IT IS SO HOT. BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR, THERE IS A THUNDERSTORM IN THE DISTANCE.
SO, IT IS GOING TO RAIN AGAIN, MAYBE. >> INTERESTING. >> THEY NEED TO GET THIS DONE BEFORE THE RAIN COMES AGAIN AND
AS EVERYONE WILL NOW KNOW RAISES THE BACTERIA. JUST SEEN ANOTHER PIECE OF
LIGHTNING ACROSS THERE N THAT DIRECTION. SO, THEY NEED TO GET IT DONE. TOMORROW, WE ARE CROSSING OUR
FINGERS >> ALL RIGHT, FINGERS CROSSED I KNOW YOU ARE LOCKED IN THE LIVE SHOT CAMERA BUT HAVE YOU GOTTEN
TO SEE ANYTHING COOL OR INTERESTING? >> I WENT TO THE TENNIS. I LOVE TENNIS. THAT WAS REALLY GREAT.
I LOVE THAT. I WANT TO GET DOWN TO THE
BREAKING. SO MANY AMAZING THINGS HERE. >> EVERY SINGLE DAY I JUST WANT, I WAS THE KIER SIMONS
FAVORITE THING UPDATES. >> I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT. >> LOVE TO SEE YOU FRIEND, APPRECIATE IT. >>> LET'S GET YOU OVER TO THE
FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. >>> SUPREME COURT RULING A
MAN'S CONVICTION OVERTURNED HAS TO STAY BEHIND BARS UNTIL HE IS RETRIED IN COURT. WE HAVE BEEN TELLING BUT THIS
STORY. INCARCERATED FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS FOR A MURDER HE DID NOT COMMIT. SET TO BE RELEASED LAST WEEK
BECAUSE A JUDGE AGREED UNTIL THE SUPREME COURT GRANTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REQUEST FOR A STAY IN THAT STATE.
NOW, HE MUST STAY IN PRISON WHILE CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE PENDING. >>> NUMBER 2, MORE THAN 100
PEOPLE ARE KILLED AFTER LANDSLIDES IN SOUTHERN INDIA. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE MISSING OR TRAPPED.
ROADS ARE BLOCKED AND THINGS ARE SO UNSTABLE RIGHT NOW THAT THEY CAN NOT GET IN THERE TO DO
ANY RESCUES, MORE RAIN EXPECTED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
>>> THE SON OF ANGELINA JOLIE AND BRAD PITT HAD TO BE
HOSPITALIZED AFTER A EBIKE. THE BIKE COLLIDED WITH A STOPPED CAR. DID NOT SAY WHO WAS INVOLVED.
PAX IS IN STABLE CONDITION. REPS FOR BOTH OF THE STARS HAVE NOT YET RESPONDED TO A REQUEST
FOR COMMENT. >>> MICROSOFT NOW INVESTIGATING NEW OUTAGES TODAY. EFFECTING OFFICE AND OTHER
SERVICES AROUND THE WORLD. EARLIER THIS MONTH, I SHOULD SAY, YOU REMEMBER THAT ROUTINE
SOFTWARE UPDATE CAUSED THAT GLOBAL IT TECH MELTDOWN THAT EFFECTED EVERYTHING FROM YOUR FLIGHTS TO MY FLIGHTS TO
HOSPITALS ET CETERA. THE CAUSE OF THIS ONE, NOT CLEAR. MICROSOFT SAYS SOME SERVICES ARE BACK IN LINE.
NOT THE SAME AS WHAT WE SAW A WEEK AGO. >>> NUMBER 5, NEW RESEARCH
SUGGESTS A WEIGHT LOSS DRUG
SIMILAR TO OZEMPIC COULD PROTECT ALZHEIMER'S SOME, OF THESE CAN FIGHT ADDICTION, THE
NEW FINDINGS ARE NOT PUBLISHED YET. BUT, IT CAN CUT THE RISK OF
DEMENTIA WITH PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES SOMETHING TO WATCH. >>> ALSO SOMETHING TO WATCH,
TESLA RECALLING TWO MILLION CARS TO PREVENT THEIR MOODS FROM POPPING OPEN WHILE YOU ARE
DRIVING DOWN THE STREET. THERE IS TESLA'S NINTH RECALL OF THE YEAR THEY FOUND IN THEIR WORDS I AM QUOTING HERE, LATCH
SWITCH DEFORMATION. OPENING, BLOCKING SOMEONE'S
VIEW, CLEARLY AN ISSUE. THEY WILL FIX IT WITH A SOFTWARE UPDATE ON THE MODELS. WE ARE SHOWING YOU THE MODELS
HERE. DRIVERS WILL BE NOTIFIED PROPERLY IF THEIR HOODS POP
OPEN. I AM JOINED BY TOM COSTELLO, NINE RECALLS, THE YEAR IS ONLY HALFWAY OVER, IS THAT A LOT?
>> WELL, LET'S TAKE A LOOK. WE HAVE A LIST OF WHAT OTHER CAR COMPANIES HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF THE RECALLS ALREADY
THIS YEAR. IT IS REALLY NOT THAT MUCH. LOOK AT THIS. WE HAVE A BUNCH OF THEM OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW
MONTHS. FORD HAD SEVEN RECALLS, CHRYSLER HAS HAD ABOUT 36, BMW, 17, KIA15, I GOT A RECALL ON MY
CAR FOR A FUEL PUMP ISSUE, I CAN NOT GET FIXED YET WAITING FOR PARTS TO COME IN.
REAL, IT IS NOT THAT MUCH. >> OKAY. >> BUT, A RECALL CAN BE EVERYTHING FROM A, WHATEVER, A
SEAT BELT LATCH THAT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY TO IN THIS CASE THE HOOD LATCH THAT IS NOT
WORKING PROPERLY, NOT A GOOD IDEA IF YOUR HOOD FLIES UP ON YOU AS YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN THE
ROAD. BY THE WAY THE CONSISTENT THEME ACROSS THIS RECALL ALL OF THESE DEFORMED HOOD LACHES WERE MADE
IN CHINA, EVERY ONE OF THEM. THEY THINK THIS EFFECTS FEWER THAN 1% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF
VEHICLES THAT ARE RECALLED. MAYBE ONLY 1% HAVE AN ISSUE. >> THAT IS INTERESTING.
OBVIOUSLY TESLA, OWNED BY ELON MUSK, UNDER CRITICISM FOR SPREAD A LITTLE THING GIVEN HE HAS A STAKE IN A LOT OF
DIFFERENT THINGS. >> YES, SPACE X, THE BORING COMPANY. >> YES. SECOND QUARTER PROFITS JUST LAST WEEK A DROP IN WHAT THEY
EARNED HERE. IS THE COMPANY IN DANGER FINANCIALLY? I AM ASKING YOU TO PUT ON YOUR CNBC. >> NO, I AM GEEKY GUY ON THIS.
LET'S PUT THE GRAPHIC BACK UP. IT IS IMPORTANT. Q2 PROFITS DOWN 45%.
THERE YOU GO. RIGHT THERE. HOWEVER, YOU KNOW, TOTAL SALES ARE STILL HEALTHY. THE STOCK DOWN 9% TODAY BECAUSE
OF THE RECALL. AND THEN IT IS DOWN A TOTAL OF 20% SO FAR FROM THE HIGH
EARLIER THIS YEAR. WALL STREET IS KIND OF BETTING RIGHT NOW THAT TESLA IS MOVING TOWARDS AND WILL BE SUCCESSFUL
IN BECOMING MORE OF AN AI-TYPE OF COMPANY. AND, LISTEN A LOT OF SPACE
RIGHT NOW IN THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE SPACE, EV SALES HAVE BEEN KIND OF WEAK FOR TESLA,
OTHER COMPANIES AS WELL NOT JUST TESLA. THEY ARE BETTING THAT, IN FACT, ELON WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN
TRANSFORMING TESLA INTO SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST A BATTERY AND A CAR COMPANY. THERE IS ALSO THE TRUMP EFFECT
HERE. >> THAT IS INTERESTING, SAY MORE. >> ELON WRAPPED HIMSELF INTO THE TRUMP ORBIT.
ENDORSED TRUMP, HE HAS BEEN PUTTING OUT SOME, AI-GENERATED
ANTIHARRIS ADS ON TWITTER. AND, THIS CAN GO ONE OF TWO
WAYS. YOU MIGHT SEE PEOPLE PRO-TRUMP NOW I AM GOING TO BUY ONE OF
THE THE TESLAS, CONVERSELY, FOLKS OFFENDED BY THAT, MAY NOT. RISKY WHEN ANYONE WEIGHS IN ON POLITICS LIKE THAT
>> I WILL NAME YOU CO-PRODUCER OF THE SHOW, TOM, LATER, WE HAVE A DEEP DIVE ON THIS.
THE BATTLE OF THE TECH BILLIONAIRES AND WHAT IT MEANS >> WHAT A GREAT IDEA I HAD [ LAUGHTER ] >> TOM, WE ARE LAUNCHING IT,

HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING READY TO DEMAND JUSTICE FOR SONYA MASSEY.
WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE SHERIFF WHO IS FACING CHARGES. >>> META AGREEING TO PAY TEXAS
$1 BILLION, BUT WHY? BEING IT. WHAT DOES IT DO FOR OUR HEALTH? >> WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA TO BE A SAFER
PLACE? >>> HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED IN CHICAGO NOT TOO LONG FROM NOW FOR A RAL TOW
DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SONYA MASSEY. THE 36-YEAR-OLD MOTHER WHO WAS SHOT ASK KILLED BY A POLICE OFFICER IN HER OWN HOME EARLIER THIS MONTH. RIGHT NOW YOU ARE LOOKING AT
LIVE PICTURES, THAT IS ATTORNEY CRUMP AND REVEREND SHARPTON THERE AS WELL.
THIS IS A PRERALLY NEWS CONFERENCE BEFORE IT IS SET TO BE BEGIN. THE MAN CHARGED, HAS BEEN
FIRED, PLED NOT GUILTY TO CHARGES INCLUDING FIRST-DEGREE MURDER AS WELL AS OTHERS.
MAGGIE VESPA IS JOINING US. GIVE US A SENSE OF WHERE THINGS STAND.
THE UNION IS REQUESTING THE
OFFICER BE REINSTATED. THE UNDERSTANDABLY UPSET. >> Reporter: THAT IS WHY THIS PRESS CONFERENCE WAS SCHEDULED. WE KNEW ABOUT A RALLY LATER ON
TONIGHT AT THAT CHURCH IN CHICAGO THIS YOU JUST SHOWED THE LIVE PICTURE OF.
ONCE THE ILLINOIS ORDER OF POLICE FILED THAT GRIEVANCE SAYING THAT DEPUTY SHAWN
GRAYSON, NOW FORMER DEPUTY, WAS FIRED WITHOUT JUST CAUSE AND DEMANDING THAT HE BE REINSTATED
IN THE WAKE OF SONYA MASSEY'S DEATH. THAT IS WHERE YOU SEE IT.
YOU SEE CRUMP FLYING IN TO BE WITH THE FAMILY AND SHARPTON AND LEFT, HER MOTHER AND HER
TEENAGE SON. WHAT YOU SEE RIGHT NOW, THE FAMILY IS GOING TO SAY THEY ARE OUTRAGED. WE GOT A PRESS CONFERENCE
ALLUDING TO THIS. THE LABOR UNION WOULD, AGAIN, MAKE THOSE DEMANDS SAYING HE
WAS FIRED WITHOUT JUST CAUSE. THIS COMPOUNDS THE OUTRAGE WE
ALREADY HEARD FROM THE FAMILY. SONYA MASSEY KILLED IN HER
HOME. CALLED 911 ABOUT A POSSIBLE PROWLER, SHE WAS UNARMED BUT HOLDING A POT OF BOILING WATER.
CROUCHED DOWN, BEGGING FOR HER LIFE BEFORE WE SAW ON DISTURBING BODY CAMERA VIDEO, SHE WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN HER
OWN HOME. THE STORY CONTINUES TO UNFOLD, LAYER BY LAYER, THIS IS A WAY, A PIECE OF OUTRAGE WE ARE
SEEING FROM THIS POOR FAMILY. >> THE ACCOUNTABILITY LENS IS
REALLY CRITICAL HERE FROM TH FAMILY'S PERSPECTIVE.
>> Reporter: IT IS, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE SPOKE PUBLICLY. THE DAY THE BODY CAMERA VIDEO
WAS RELEASED LAST MONDAY, HE RELEASED A STATEMENT ON FACEBOOK. HAD NOT SEEN HIM ON CAMERA OR IN FRONT OF 300 PEOPLE IN A
STADIUM AT WHAT IS CALLED A LISTENING AND HEALING SESSION HELD LAST NIGHT HERE IN
SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS. FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SPOKE PUBLICLY, HE FACED A CROWD OF
HUNDREDS AND HE APOLOGIZED SAYING HIS DEPARTMENT HAD FAILED SONYA MASSEY.
HERE IS WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT. >> SONYA MASSEY, I SPEAK HER
NAME. I WILL NEVER FORGET IT. WE FAILED HER, HER FAMILY AND
FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY AND I STAND HERE IN FRONT OF YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.
>> NOW, OF COURSE, THAT STATEMENT COMES AFTER WE AND A NUMBER OF JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN
UNCOVERING WHAT THE FAMILIES SEES AS RED FLAGS FROM THE OFFICER'S PAST, DUI AND A
NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT IN PREVIOUS JOBS. HE HAS BEEN IN SIX LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SINCE 2020. THIS LAST ONE, A NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT BUT LEFT THE JOB IN GOOD STANDING.
IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THE SHERIFF KNEW WHEN HIRED HIM. LAST NIGHT THE SHERIFF REFUSES TO STEP DOWN IN THE WAKE OF
THIS, HALLIE? >> MAGGIE, LOTS TO FOLLOW AND WATCH THERE, THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE. >>> NBC NEWS COVERS HUNDREDS OF
STORIES EVERY DAY. BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ OR WATCH OR LISTEN TO THEM ALL, OUR BUREAU TEAMS HAVE DONE IT
FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT THEY TELL US IS GOING DOWN IN THEIR REGIONS IN
A SEGMENT CALLED "THE LOCAL" METAAGREEING TO PAY $1 BILLION TO TEXAS.
USING FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT DATA ON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT
THEIR PERMISSION, META SAYS THEY ARE PLEASED TO RESOLVE THE MATTER. >>> ALSO, FIREFIGHTERS IN GEORGIA RESCUING A PLAN WHO

WAS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AS A SILICONE VALLEY FUNDRAISER WITH REPUBLICANS TRYING TO GET MORE AND MORE SUPPORT FROM TECH
GIANTS AND ON WALL STREET. YOU HAVE HARRIS THERE TRYING TO GET MONEY WITH THIS ELECTION FIGHT INVOLVING A HUGE AMOUNT
OF MONEY PICKS UP STEAM. >> Reporter: RIGHT NOW MANY ROADS FOR THE 2024 ELECTION
CYCLE SEEM TO BE LEADING BACK TO THE ULTRAWEALTHY, FAR AWAY FROM WASHINGTON. >> YOU KNOW, ELON, I LOVE ELON
MUSK. I LOVE HIM. POLITICIANS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE COURTING THE MEGARICH
TRYING TO GET THEM TO DUMP BILLIONS INTO THEIR CAMPAIGN.
DENOUNCING FORMER PRESIDENT OVER THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL >> I VOTED FOR HIM. TODAY, I AM SORRY I DID THAT.
WE NEED TO HEAL FROM TRUMP. IT WAS REALLY A DEVASTATING BLOW. >> NOW HE IS SAYING HE WILL
VOTE FOR TRUMP AGAIN. HE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE TURNING AROUND HIS SUPPORT.
THERE IS A VENTURE CAPITALIST, FORMER PAYPAL EXECUTIVE, AND
REAL ESTATE TYCOON ROBERT BIGELOW THAT GAVE $1 MILLION TO HELP TRUMP'S LEGAL FEES, THE
BIG QUESTION, WHY? WHAT ARE THESE BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMEN HAVING TO GAIN? >> IT IS A DRUMBEAT OF MONEY
GOING TO TRUMP. TRUTH IS AING WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. CUTTING THE CORPORATE TAX RATE AGAIN.
HE IS TALKING ABOUT SAVING THEM MONEY, LONG-TERM. >> Reporter: SOME CASES THEY
ARE HELPING SWAY HUGE DECISIONS. BILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN MEGA DONOR TOLD THE ATLANTIC THAT
TRUMP WAS CRAZIER AND MORE DANGEROUS THAN HE THOUGHT BACK IN NOVEMBER. >> IT IS TIME TO REBUILD AMERICA. >> WARMED BACK UP TO THE FORMER
PRESIDENT ACCORDING TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES." AND, ACCORDING TO "THE
WASHINGTON POST,," HE WORKED HARD BEHIND-THE-SCENES WITH ELON MUSK TO CONVINCE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO PUT J.D.
VANCE THAT USED TO WORK FOR HIM ON THE TICKET. NBC NEWS REACHED OUT TO THE BIG REPUBLICAN DONORS FOR COMMENT
BUT HAS NOT IMMEDIATELY HEARD BACK. AND IT IS NOT JUST REPUBLICANS TRYING TO COZY UP TO THESE
MEGADONORS, KAMALA HARRIS FORTIFYING HER OWN STRENGTH AMONG WEALTHY DONORS AS MANY OPEN THEIR WALLETS BACK UP NOW
THAT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS OFF OF THE TICKET.
ABGAL DISNEY TURNED BACK ON THE TAP AFTER REFUSING TO DONATE IF BIDEN STAYS IN THE RACE.
HOFFMAN, THE COFOUNDER OF LINKED IN WORKING THE PHONES TO GET SUPPORT FOR HARRIS. NOW ON TRACK TO RAISE $100
MILLION. >> A CASE WE ARE HEARING FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT TO COME AND SUPPORT HER OVER TRUMP IS LIKE THIS, SHE IS WILLING TO HAVE
CONVERSATIONS WITH CEO'S, BIDEN DID NOT ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. HE HAD PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE
THE TALKS FOR HIM. >> Reporter: THE MONEY, CRUCIAL TO DOMINATING THE AIRWAVES FOR BOTH SIDES. >> SINCE HARRIS ROSE TO THE TOP
OF THE TICKET THERE HAS BEEN, YOU KNOW, OVER $100 MILLION PUT IN FUTURE AD RESERVATIONS IN
THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS, SUPPORT FOR HARRIS AND AGAINST HARRIS BY TRUMP AND HIS ACTION COMMITTEE THAT IS THE TELL OF
WHERE WE WILL SEE A LOT OF THIS MONEY. >> Reporter: SHOWING THE
IMPORTANCE, INFLUENCE, POWER, THESE BIG MONEY DONORS YIELD WITH LESS THAN 100 DAYS UNTIL
THE ELECTION. >>> YAZ IS JOINING US NOW, WHAT IS NEXT BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER? >> Reporter: MONEY TALKS, THAT
IS POLITICAL POWER WHEN IT COMES UP TO THE LEAD UP TO THE ELECTION. INFLUENCE IN GETTING J.D.
VANCE ON THE TICKET TAKING THE FORMER PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT MAKING VANCE HIS VICE PRESIDENT, IT IS ALL ABOUT THE
ATTACK ADS, ALL OF THIS MONEY, WE CAN NOT UNDERSCORE IT, EVERY ELECTION YEAR WE KNOW THIS,
THEY ARE VYING FOR THE MEGADONORS, THIS YEAR AROUND, BECAUSE OF A SHORT RUNWAY UNTIL NOVEMBER WITH KAMALA HARRIS AT
THE TOP OF THE TICKET FOR THE DEMOCRATS IT WILL BE ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ADS, BECAUSE KAMALA
HARRIS HAS SO LITTLE TIME, THEY NEED THIS MONEY, THEY NEED IT FAST AND THEY ARE GETTING IT, BY THE WAY, TO ROLL OUT THESE
ATTACK ADS IN THE NEXT 100 DAYS AND TRUMP AND VANCE RETHINKING THEIR STRATEGY AS WELL WITH A NEW PERSON AT THE TOP OF THE
TICKET TO ROLL OUT THEIR ATTACK ADS AS WELL. JUST LOOKING AT MY EMAIL 30
MINUTES OR SO, TRUMP ROLLING OUT ANOTHER ATTACK AD ON HARRIS ON THE BORDER. AND SO THAT IS WHY MONEY IS SO
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS AND HOW WE WILL SEE IT PLAY OUT OVER THE NEXT
100 NBC NEWS NOW. >>> KRISTEN WELKER HOSTS "MEET THE PRESS" ON NBC.
>> LESTER HOLT AMERICA'S MOST TRUSTED NEWS ANCHOR.
>>> FEDERAL REGULATORS TODAY TAKING AIM AT AMAZON'S MARKETPLACE.
SAYING AMAZON CAN BE HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SELLING A BUNCH OF STUFF THAT DOES NOT WORK OR MIGHT BE HAZARDOUS.
THIS APPLIES EVEN WHEN THE STUFF THAT THEY ARE SELLING COMES FROM A THIRD PARTY
VENDOR. UNDER THE NEW RULING FROM THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION AMAZON WILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO RECALL
THAT FAULTY STUFF. IT SOUNDS LIKE IF YOU BUY SOMETHING ON AMAZON THAT DOES NOT WORK AMAZON HAS TO MAKE IT
RIGHT, FAIR? >> Reporter: YEAH, HALLIE, THAT IS FAIR. IT COULD CHANGE HOW AMAZON DOES
BUSINESS FROM HERE ONGOING FORWARD AND THEY HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION FOR
YEARS NOW AS AMAZON TRIED TO
MAINTAIN, HALLIE, THEY ARE MERELY A CONDUIT OF GOODS ON AMAZON. THAT IS NOT THE FINDINGS WHERE
THEY SAY AMAZON FITS SQUARELY AS A DISTRIBUTOR OF GOODS SO
THEY BEAR LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR RECALL. AS SUCH, THEY ARE SAYING THAT AMAZON AS YOU MENTIONED HAS TO
MAKE RIGHT BY THE CONSUMER BY THE CUSTOMER AND YOU MENTIONED THIS THIRD PARTY SELLER.
THIS BUSINESS HAS EXPLODED ON THE PLATFORM OF AMAZON OVER THE
LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN PARTICULAR, HALLIE. THE NUMBERS ARE STAGGERING HERE. AS OF LAST CHECK ABOUT 60% OF
AMAZON'S ECOMMERCE COMES FROM THESE THIRD PARTY SELLERS AND THOSE ARE THE GOODS THAT WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IN THIS
DECISION HERE. THEY ARE GOODS THAT THE AGENCY FOUND COULD BE COUNTERFEIT, UNSAFE OR EXPIRED.
THOSE ARE THE ONES THEY ARE TRYING TO HOLD AMAZON
ACCOUNTABLE HERE THROUGH A VARIETY OF MEANS GOING FORWARD. >> FOR A LONG TIME AMAZON TRIED TO DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS A GO
BETWEEN, BETWEEN VENDORS AND SHOPPERS THEY ARE JUST THE PERSON PASSING ALONG THE GOODS,
RIGHT? >> Reporter: RIGHT. EXACTLY. AND AMAZON FOR THEIR PART SAYS INSPITE OF THIS DECISION THAT THEY PLAN TO APPEAL IT.
SAYING THAT AMAZON STANDS BEHIND THE SAFETY OF EVERY PRODUCT IN ITS STORE REGARDLESS OF IF IT IS SOLD BY THE COMPANY
OR A THIRD PARTY SELLER. A BIT OF A DEJA VU ON BOTH SIDES HERE, BACK IN 2021 THE
CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION HAD AMAZON UPDATE THE RETURNS POLICY AND THEY SUED AMAZON TO RECALL HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS IT DEEMED HAZARDOUS. THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH MORE THAN 400,000 GOODS, THAT IS A
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER HERE. AMONG THOSE, SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.
FAULTY CARBON MONOXIDE
DETECTORS AND HAIR DRIVERS WITHOUT PROTECTION AND THAT WAS IN 2021 STRESSING THAT IS NOT GOOD
ENOUGH. THEY SHOULD HAVE OFFERED A FULL REFUND GOING FORWARD. HAILLE? >> MORGAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR THAT BREAKDOWN. AND THK YOANU FOR JOINING US. COVERAGE PICKS UP RIGHT NOW.

>>> WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR WITH A KEY SWING STATE STOP. ON A NEW TICKET FOR DEMOCRATS,
ACCORDING TO OUR TICKETS. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS MIGHT HIT THE ROAD WITH HER NEW RUNNING
MATE. AND WHAT MEGAN THEE STALLION HAS TO DO WITH IT.
>>> THE ASSASSINATION ATTACK, SAYING IT'S NOT SENSIBLE. SO WHAT'S NEXT?
IN OUR NBC NEWS EXCLUSIVE WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ABOUT IT ALL. >>> THE MOMENT THE WORLD IS
WAITING FOR. ISRAEL HITTING BACK AT HEZBOLLAH. THE STRIKES AFTERMATH.
AND WHY FIREFIGHTERS ARE STRUGGLING TO GET THE PARK FIRE
UNDER CONTROL WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STILL NOT ABLE TO HEAD BACK HOME. >>> CALLING THE REGIME TEAM.
FOUR YEARS AFTER ASSEMBLING IN TOKYO. WE WILL TELL YOU HOW THE WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS SQUAD -- AND
THE TIKTOK'S THEY PLANNED RIGHT AFTER THEY WON.
HEY THERE, I'M HAILLE.
DEMOCRATS APPEAR TO BE CLOSER TO A FULL TICKET AS THE VICE PRESIDENT SETS TO HIT THE TRAIL. SAYING SHE HAS NOT MADE UP HER
MIND YET ON WHO HER RUNNING MATE WILL BE. THERE SHE IS.
TWO SOURCES TELL NBC NEWS THAT HARRIS IN HER PICS, THESE MEN
HERE HEADING TO SOME BATTLEGROUND STATES TOGETHER NEXT WEEK.
WE THINK SHE WILL MAKE THAT PAID BY AUGUST 7th. THE VICE PRESIDENT TONIGHT MAKING HER FIRST PICK IN GEORGIA
AS A LIKELY NOMINEE. RE-ENERGIZING DEMOCRATS.
BRINGING IN MEGAN THEE STALLION WHO HIT THE STAGE, A BIG CELEBRITY SUPPORTER, AS WELL.
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS RUNNING MATE WILL HEAD TO A CAMPAIGN
THIS WEEKEND, SAME PLACE, DIFFERENT TIME. THEY SPAN OUT ACROSS THE SWING
STATES, TOO. YAMICHE, WE WILL START WITH YOU.
YOU WERE THERE. IT'S NOT LIKE SHE WILL NAME HER VP PICK THEIR.
>> Reporter: A SORT OF SWAG HE CAMPAIGN SEASON. WHAT I'M HEARING, IT WILL BE
ABOUT THE ECONOMY. AND THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING.
ROLLING OUT THE POLICIES, SAYING, I WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
MAYBE POSSIBLY SOME NEW CONVERSATIONS IN WAYS THAT ASH
--
>> Reporter: CALLING HIM A FRAUDSTER, A TEETER. -- CHEATER.
>> YAMICHE, WE ARE PLAYING AUDIO ROULETTE . WE DID HEAR YOU TALK ABOUT THE SWAGGY VIBE.
WE WILL COME BACK TO THAT. THANK YOU. SETTING TO ANNOUNCE THE RUNNING MATE SPEAKING IN THE NEXT WEEK
OR EIGHT DAYS. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TICKET, NEW DEVELOPMENTS AS IT
RELATES TO AN ATTACK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN LEVELING AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.
DASHA BURNS IS LIVE FOR US IN THE BATTLEGROUNDS. DASHA, IT HAS TO DO WITH
PROJECT 2025. WE TALKED ABOUT IT.
THIS RIGHT-WING STATION, ESSENTIALLY.
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS DISTANCED THEMSELVES, OR HAVE TRIED TO.
THEY ARE WINDING DOWN THEIR POLICY WORK. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> Reporter: YEAH, HAILLE. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THEIR LEADER IS NOW STEPPING DOWN IN THE WAKE OF THE
PRESIDENT REALLY TRYING TO CREATE THAT DISTANCE. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN REALLY
TRYING TO TIE THEM TOGETHER. THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF
DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THEY WOULD REJECT SOME OF THOSE PROPOSALS.
AND THEY WANTED TO REALLY LINK TRUMP AND THAT PROJECT.
NOW SAYING THAT THEY ARE WINDING DOWN THEIR POLICY WORK, SAYING THEIR DEMISE WOULD BE WELCOMED.
AND TO ANY OTHERS WHO ARE CLAIMING THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. THEY TRIED TO SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM THEIR WORK.
EVEN THOUGH SOME OF HIS FORMER STAFF WAS A PART OF THAT PROJECT. SAYING THAT THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY SHUTTING DOWN.
AND SAYING THEY AVE BUILT A TOOL FOR ANY FUTURE ADMINISTRATIONS USE. THEY ARE SAYING IF TRUMP
DOESN'T WANT IT, FINE.
THEY WILL HAVE ANOTHER REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION TO PUT INTO EFFECT, HAILLE. >> BEING ON THE DEFENSE THAT
WAS TALKED ABOUT. ARE THEY ON THAT SIDE, AS WELL?
>> Reporter: YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS CAMPAIGN ON DEFENSE AFTER AN INTERVIEW. I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LISTEN SO
YOU HAVE THE CONTEXT, AND THEN I WILL TALK ABOUT THE RESPONSE ON THE OTHER SIDE.
>> THEY TELL ME THAT HARRIS' HUSBAND, MR. PRESIDENT, IS
JEWISH. HE'S JEWISH LIKE BERNIE SANDERS IS JEWISH. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? HE'S A CRAPPY JEW.
>> Reporter: HE TOOK SOME HEAT FOR IT. SAYING IN A STATEMENT THAT HE OBVIOUSLY WASN'T AGREEING WITH
THAT STATEMENT. STOP TAKING POINTS AND TRANSCRIPTS FROM THE, THE FOLKS
-- KAMALA FOLKS.
>> LET'S CALL IT NEW CAMPAIGN. NO LONGER BIDEN-TROP, BUT
HARRIS-TROP -- HARRIS-TRUMP, IT
APPEARS. LOOKING TO HIGHLIGHT AS A PROSECUTOR, LOOKING TO GO AFTER
HARRIS SPECIFICALLY ON IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER.
>> Reporter: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. IF YOU LIVE IN A STATE LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, WE ARE OFFICIALLY
IN THAT ZONE. IT'S GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID THOSE CAMPAIGN ADS FROM HERE ON OUT. BUT YEAH, $50 MILLION.
THAT AD WITH THE SO-CALLED FEARLESS LEADER, TALKING HER BACKGROUND ON THE OTHER SIDE.
THEY ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH A FEW DIFFERENT POINTS OF MESSAGING.
REALLY, THEY ARE FOCUSED ON IMMIGRATION AS A KEY TOPIC.
THAT SOMETHING THEY THINK IS A VULNERABILITY FOR DEMOCRATS, GOING AFTER HARRIS, SAYING THAT SHE FAILED AS THE, QUOTE,
BORDER -- AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE FOCUSED ON. THAT IS LIKELY THE MESSAGE
WE'VE BEEN HEARING.
>> THANK YOU.
SAYING IT'S THE SAME, AND THEY CANNOT DEFEND THE SECURITY FAILURES.
SPEAKING WITH LAWMAKERS TODAY. THINGS ARE PRETTY INTENSE. LISTEN.
>> NOTHINGS ON A CHANGE. UNTIL SOMEBODY LOSES THEIR JOB.
>> BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THIS WAS AN EXCUSABLE SECURITY AND PLANNING FAILURE.
>> YOU NEED TO INVESTIGATE TO KNOW THAT THERE WERE CRITICAL AND THE FAILURES THAT SOME INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW?
>> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SITTING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. >> WAS THE DIFFERENCE? >> YOU LOSE THE SUPPORT OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK YOU'RE BEING DIRECT WITH THEM.
>> HOW COMMUNICATIONS FROM THEM BETWEEN LOCAL POLICE AND THE SECRET SERVICE THAT DAY. NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE GUNMAN, AS WELL.
AND THE ACCOUNT POSTING ANTI SEMITIC AND ANTI-IMMIGRANT VIEWS.
THEY'VE BEEN ALL OVER THIS ONE HERE. THERE WERE A LOT OF DEVELOPMENTS. INTERESTING WHEN YOU CONTRAST THIS ONE AND THE PREVIOUS HEAD
OF THE SECRET SERVICE WHO STEPPED DOWN.
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, HAILLE. WHAT WE GOT WAS A TIMELINE FROM
THE SECRET SERVICE IS PERSPECTIVE AS FAR AS WHAT HAPPENED.
THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH.
BETWEEN WHAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT KNEW ABOUT THE SHOOTER, WHAT THE SECRET SERVICE DATE, VACH DATA, AND
WHAT HAPPENED. MICHAEL ROLLE EXPLAINED THE EVENTS OF THAT.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT BASED ON WHAT I KNOW RIGHT NOW, NOT OF THE SECRET SERVICE
COUNTER SNIPER TEAM, NOR MEMBERS OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT SECURITY DETAIL HAD ANY
KNOWLEDGE THERE WAS A MAN ON THE ROOF OF THE HR BUILDING
WITH A FIREARM. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THOSE PERSONNEL WILL NOT -- WERE NOT
AWARE UNTIL THEY HEARD GUNSHOTS. PRIOR TO THAT, THEY WERE OPERATING WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT LOW LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS WORKING AN ISSUE OF A SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUAL PRIOR TO
THE SHOTS BEING FIRED. >> THE KEY THING HERE,
ACCORDING TO ROWE, THERE WAS A 30 SECOND GAP.
AND PHYSICALLY SEEING THE SHOOTER, THOMAS CROOKS, ON THE ROOF.
AND INTO THE SAME COMMAND POST WHERE THE SECRET SERVICE IS SAYING THERE WAS A MAN ON THE ROOF WITH A GUN. THEN SHOTS ARE
FILED -- FIRED A DONALD TRUMP.
AND WHY IT WASN'T ACTED ON SOONER, GRANTED IT WAS ONLY 30 SECONDS. BUT IT WAS 30 SECONDS.
I THINK IT WILL ALLUDE TO MORE QUESTIONS AS THIS GOES FORWARD. >> ALSO, WITH THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND. THERE WILL BE MORE ON THAT
TONIGHT ON NIGHTLY, BUT SOME HEADLINES HERE. >> RIGHT. A COUPLE OF HEADLINES, THE DISCUSSIONS HERE AS FAR AS
MURDER. WE HEARD FROM THE FBI DIRECTOR TALKING ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION. THE WORK THAT YOU SAW THERE ON THE ROOF.
WITH WHO THE FBI IS TALKING TO, HOW MANY AGENT INVOLVED. THAT'S BACK TO SOMETHING YOU
MENTIONED EARLIER. GOING BACK TO 2019-2020.
IF THAT SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT IS CONFIRMED TO ALONG TO CROOKS,
THE SHOOTER, HE ADVOCATED FOR POLITICAL VIOLENCE.
HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS EXTREME VIEWS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE FBI DISCUSSED.
AND AS FAR AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, FEDERALLY, HE TALKED ABOUT HIS REAL CONCERNS WITH
THE SHOOTING TODAY. >> HOW WAS A 20-YEAR-OLD ABLE
TO GET A CLEAR SHOT 150 YARDS FROM A FORMER PRESIDENT?
>> THIS IS EXTREMELY ALARMING. DEMOCRACY WILL NOT SURVIVE IF PEOPLE DECIDE THAT THE WAY THEY
WILL GET WHATEVER OUTCOMES THEY WANT, OR WHATEVER MOTIVE YOU MIGHT HAVE IS BY KILLING SOMEONE.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE, WHY IT HAPPENED, AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
>> OF COURSE, THE SECRET SERVICE DOES NOT REPORT TO THEM. YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING INTO WHAT THEY COULD HAVE DONE TO BETTER ASSIST THE
SECRET SERVICE. BUT AT THIS POINT, IT WAS A QUESTION FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> SO WHAT IS GOING TO CHANGE, IF ANYTHING? WILL THEY BE STEPS TO PROTECT
CANDIDATES, FORMER PRESIDENT? SHE WILL HAVE HER RUNNING MATE,
AS WELL. >> YEAH. BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, THIS WILL ALL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT.
AS YOU AND I KNOW OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS OR SO, CANDIDATES HAVE CRISSCROSSED THIS COUNTRY,
TRYING TO GET VERY UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH VOTERS. THE TYPE OF EVENTS WHERE THEY
ARE GOING TO THESE COUNTIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU'VE GOT PENNSYLVANIA,
WISCONSIN, OTHER AREAS WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO RURAL VOTERS. TRYING TO GET AS
MANY PEOPLE ENGAGED IN VOTING FOR THEM AS POSSIBLE. THE QUESTION WILL BE, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THIS?
THE CAMPGROUNDS, FAIRGROUNDS, TYPE OF WHICH WE ARE LOOKING AT ON-SCREEN. HOW WILL THEY BE ABLE TO SECURE THESE? WILL THESE TYPE OF
RALLIES BE ABLE TO GO ON? I THINK IT IS VERY MUCH A QUESTION.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS YOU MENTIONED, KEN DILANIAN DID AN INTERVIEW WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. MORE ON THAT WITH LESTER HOLT.
TONIGHT, RECEIVING THE DETAILS AFTER A MOMENT THE WORLD HAD BEEN RATING FOR -- WAITING FOR.
RIGHT HERE NEAR THE LEBANESE CAPITOL. CLAIMING TO KILL A TOP
HEZBOLLAH COMMANDER. AND IN ISRAELI CONTROL TERRITORY.
YOU ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE AFTERMATH HERE. FIRST RESPONDERS, TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE SITUATION.
ONE WOMAN WAS KILLED. NEARLY SEVEN OTHER PEOPLE HURT. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS THE
HEZBOLLAH COMMANDER HAS, QUOTING HERE, AMERICAN BLOOD ON
HIS HANDS. ALSO, A 1983 BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 AMERICAN SERVICE
MEMBERS. THIS IS THE MOMENT THAT THEY'VE BEEN HOLDING THEIR BREATH FOR.
THE ISRAELI SAID THEY DID SEEK RETALIATION. ERE IS MATT
BRADLEY. >> Reporter: THIS COULD BE IT.
THEY ARE WAITING TO SEE WHETHER ISRAEL B -- WILL BE SATISFIED.
A LOT OF RHETORIC FROM BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ON DOWN, DESCRIBING HOW THEY WILL RETALIATE.
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ARE LAYING THE COUNTRY TO WASTE. THIS IS PRETTY LIMITED, PRETTY
TARGETED. THIS COULD MEAN THERE IS MORE
TO COME. AND MORE TO COME ON THE HEZBOLLAH SIDE.
HOW WILL THEY RESPOND TO THIS RETALIATION? WILL THEY RETALIATE THEMSELVES? WILL THEY ESCALATE FURTHER?
WITH A INTRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF A REGIONWIDE WAR? YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS. WHETHER OR NOT IRAN WILL ENTER INTO CONFLICTS WITH HEZBOLLAH.
AND IF IT WILL INCREASE IF IRAN ENTERS. THE ALLY, AND THE MEDITERRANEAN
HERE. WILL THEY ANSWER ON ISRAEL SIDE AS WELL? THAT WILL RISK A FULL ON
REGIONWIDE CONFLICT THAT COULD -- THE WHOLE MIDDLE EAST,
INCLUDING OTHER ISRAELI ALLIES. AND OTHER GROUPS THAT ARE
BENEFICIARIES. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT IN THE REGION.
SO YES, IT LOOKS AS THIS IS THE THING WE WERE WAITING FOR.
THERE STILL COULD BE A LOT MORE BLOOD TO BE SHED. HAILLE? >> MATT BRADLEY, LIFE FOR US.
IN QUEUE. ALSO OVERSEAS, NEW UNREST.
DEMONSTRATORS, CLASHING WITH POLICE. A STABBING ATTACK THAT LEFT THREE CHILDREN DEAD.
THIS BIG CROWD HERE. YOU'VE GOT THOSE YELLOW POLICE VANS.
OFFICIAL SAYING DEMONSTRATORS WERE THROWING BOTTLES, DAMAGING POLICE CARS, EVEN SETTING ONE ON FIRE. ALL OF THIS COMING AS WE ARE
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE VICTIM. -- AND NINE-YEAR-OLD, ALL
ATTENDING A DANCE PARTY AND THE YOGA EVENT AT THIS COMMUNITY
CENTER. THAT'S WHEN POLICE SAY A MAN
WALKED IN THE BUILDING, STARTED STABBING PEOPLE WITH A KNIFE. -- ON INSTAGRAM, SAYING SHE IS
STILL IN SHOCK ARE YOU LITTLE KIDS AT A DANCE CLASS. I MET A COMPLETE LOSS FOR
HOWEVER TO CONVEY MY SYMPATHIES TO THESE FAMILIES.
CAN WE START OFF AT THE DEMONSTRATION, KNOWING WHERE THIS ATTACK HAPPENED TONIGHT.
WHAT'S GOING ON? >> Reporter: YEAH, A HORRIFIC
KILLING SPREE LAST NIGHT. AND ANOTHER HORRIFIC INCIDENT THAT PARLAYS ARE INDICATING MAY
BE TIED TO THAT. ACCORDING TO POLICE IN THE AREA, A GROUP OF PROTESTERS BEGAN
HURLING OBJECTS NOT FAR FROM
WHERE THE STABBING TOOK PLACE YESTERDAY. POLICE SAY THEY BELIEVE THAT
MANY OF THESE PEOPLE TODAY WERE NOT EVEN FROM THE AREA.
MAY HAVE BEEN MEMBERS OF WHAT WAS CALLED THE ENGLISH DEFENSE LEAGUE. THIS IS A FAR RIGHT ORGANIZATION
. THE POLICE YOU ARE TELLING THE MEDIA, LOOK, ALL OF THE SPECULATION ABOUT WHO THE SUSPECT IS IS NOT HELPING.
BORN IN THE UK, DESPITE SOME OF THESE RUMORS ONLINE.
IN FACT, A NAME POSTED ONLINE THAT MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE IS THE SUSPECT. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, IT'S FALSE.
YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF JUST HOW HIGH TENSIONS ARE TONIGHT.
POLICE ARE SAYING, LOOK, OUR OFFICERS ALREADY HAD TO DEAL WITH THE TRAGEDY LAST NIGHT. THE LAST THING THEY SHOULD BE DEALING WITH TONIGHT IS ANOTHER
INCIDENT OF UNREST THAT'S NOT EVEN FOUND IT ON REALITY.
>> GOING BACK TO THE ATTACK,
FAMILIES IN AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE HERE WITH THE DEATH OF THEIR CHILDREN.
>> Reporter: WE ARE LEARNING ACCORDING TO WITNESSES WHO HAVE SPOKEN TO LOCAL MEDIA THAT THIS
17-YEAR-OLD SUSPECT ARRIVED AT THE INCIDENT IN A TAXICAB. APPARENTLY, REFUSING TO PAY THE DRIVER OF THAT TAXI. IT WAS A
BIT OF A BACK-AND-FORTH THERE PRIOR TO HIM GOING TO THE COMMUNITY CENTER AND STABBING ALL OF THOSE YOUNG GIRLS.
THIS SUSPECT IS NOT BEING IDENTIFIED. UNDER BRITISH LAW, IF YOU ARE UNDERAGE, YOU ARE NOT GENERALLY IDENTIFIED EXCEPT UNDER REALLY
SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. LISTEN TO THE POLICE OFFICIAL DESCRIBING WHY THEY ARE TAKING
THIS INVESTIGATION WITH SENSITIVITY AND CARE. >> IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE
POLICE TO VIEW EVERY SINGLE AVENUE.
THE POLICE IN THAT WORK,
CUTTING ACROSS NO PREJUDICE. WE
TAKE THE INVESTIGATION IMMENSELY SERIOUSLY. >> Reporter: IN THE MEANTIME,
THE COMMUNITY IS STILL HOLDING ITS BREATH. TODAY, WE LEARNED A THIRD
VICTIM HAD DIED. EIGHT PEOPLE WE BELIEVE ARE HOSPITALIZED.
THIS COMMUNITY, REALLY HOPING THAT NO MORE OF THEM FALL VICTIM TO THEIR INJURIES.
>> JOSH LEDERMAN LIFE FOR US TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
>>> A COMBO OF WIND, HEAT, AND LIGHTNING. SPARKING UP NEW WILDFIRES.
LOOK AT THIS. ALL THE SMOKE COMING FROM ONE FIRE OVERNIGHT IN COLORADO. SEE THAT HUGE PLUME OF SMOKE.
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, NEW IMAGES FROM HERBICIDE TOWN. PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO LEAVE HOME.
ALL OF IT OF COURSE ON TOP OF THAT PARK FIRE THAT'S MASSIVE
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. NOW ONE OF THE TOP FIVE FIRES IN THAT STATE EVER.
WE ARE HEARING STORIES FROM PEOPLE WHO STAYED BEHIND TO SAVE THEIR OWN HOMES. TELLING OUR TEAM HE INSTALLED HIGH PRESSURE PUMPS AND
SPRINKLERS ALL OVER HIS PROPERTY AFTER HIS INSURANCE COMPANY DROPPED HIS COVERS JUST LAST MONTH.
>> THEY WERE LIKE, YOU GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE. I DECIDED TO STAY.
EVEN THOUGH YOU SURVIVED THE ONSLAUGHT, WE PROBABLY HAVE THOUSANDS OF SMALL FIRES ALL OVER OUR PROPERTY. IT'S TOUGH.
A LOT OF PHONE CALLS, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES.
>> NBC'S STEVE PATTERSON JOINING US NOW. WAS THE LATEST, STEVE?
REMATCHES DEVASTATION AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. IT'S A WONDER THAT ANYBODY WAS ABLE TO SAVE THEIR HOME.
IT'S PROBABLY THE WORST I'VE SEEN ON THIS FIRE. BY THE WAY, LARGER THAN THE SIZE OF LOS ANGELES.
IT'S HALF THE SIZE OF RHODE ISLAND. FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS FOR THE PAST SIX DAYS.
THESE ARE GUYS THAT ARE DOING 24 , TRYING TO PUSH THE FLAMES
BACK. SHOWING EXACTLY WHERE THE FIRE
IS MOVING. A LOT OF IT IS PUSHING AWAY
FROM CITY CENTERS. THAT'S GOOD NEWS, AS WELL.
14% CONTAINMENT ALONG THE AREAS. AGAIN, PARADISE.
AND DON'T WANT TO SEE THE FLAMES AGAIN. THEY ARE NOT IN THAT AREA.
ALL OF THAT'S GREAT NEWS. THE WEATHER IS HEATING UP.
IT WILL BE HOTTER, DRIER, AND WINDIER OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THAT WILL FURTHER COMPLICATE THE EFFORTS ON THE GROUND.
AGAIN, THE FIRE IS ENORMOUS. 380,000 ACRES, THE FIFTH LARGEST.
A LOT SAY IT WILL BE EVEN HOT -- EVEN HOTTER ON THAT LIST.
>> APPARENTLY SANK IT WAS SET ON PURPOSE.
>> Reporter: HE FACED THE JUDGE YESTERDAY. WE KNOW THAT ARSON CHARGE IS
COMING. IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
PUT SOMETHING INTO A CAR. THE CAR IGNITING ON FIRE, AND THEN PUSHING THAT CAR INTO A RAVINE.
OUR TEAM HAS BEEN TO WHERE THE SITE OF THE FIRE WAS. YOU CAN SEE WHERE THAT AREA IS. ACCORDING TO THE DISTRICT
ATTORNEY, WILL ESSENTIALLY THROW THE BOOK AT HIM, SAYING
HE DIDN'T DO THAT. HE DENIES EVER PUSHING THE CAR. HERE IS WORD FROM THE DISTRICT
ATTORNEY HIMSELF. LISTEN TO THIS. >> HE DENIES THE STATEMENT OF WITNESS. SO HE PUSHED THE
FLAMING CAR 60 FEET DOWN.
AT THIS POINT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE EVIDENCE IS STRONGER TO THE
WITNESS. >> A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PRIOR
ON HIS RECORD.
THIS WOULD BE HIS THIRD STRIKE. IF HE IS CONVICTED FOR THIS, HE'S LOOKING AT LIFE IN PRISON.
>> STEVE PATTERSON, LIFE FOR US. THANK YOU. SONIC ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY, RESCUE CREWS STANDING BY. THEY ARE CALLING THIS
CATASTROPHIC FLASH FLOODING. ACCORDING TO FORECASTERS, ABOUT
2000 PEOPLE HAD TO BE RESCUED FROM THEIR HOMES. THE WATER
HERE, MESSING UP ROADS AND A BIG WAY, DAMAGING BRIDGES.
KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS AN AREA THAT WAS ALREADY SATURATED FROM
RAIN AND HURRICANE BEARS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. WATCHING THE SITUATION CLOSELY.
ALSO WATCHING WILL HEADLINES COMING UP, INCLUDING TESLA ON ITS NINTH RECALL OF THE YEAR.
IT COULD AFFECT MILLIONS OF CARS. >>> THE SON OF ANGELINA JOLIE
AND BRAD PITT NOW IN THE HOSPITAL AFTER A BIK
>>> WE ARE AT THAT POINT IN THE SHOW.
OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, WE ARE THRILLED TO PLAY THE ROLE OF SPOILER. OLYMPICS SPOILERS, SPECIFICALLY. YOU KNOW EVERYONE TODAY WAS
WAITING TO SEE IF THEY WOULD WIN THE COMPETITION. LED BY THE GOAT, SIMONE BILES.
YES, GOLD IT IS! NOW BECOMING THE MOST DECORATED U.S. GYMNASTS IN THE HISTORY OF
THE EPICS. SHE WON EIGHT METALS AT ALL. MAY BE MORE TO COME. GOING DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL
COMPETITION IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. MAKING THE BEST POSSIBLE START
FOR WHAT SHE CALLED THE REDEMPTION TOUR. REMEMBER, SHE WITHDREW FROM THE
OLYMPICS IN 2017. AND ALL OF THESE SUPER FAMOUS
PEOPLE. MICHAEL PHELPS. SPIKE LEE.
EVERYBODY DESCENDING ON THE VENUE TO WATCH THE WOMEN COMPETE. AND THEN BACK HOME, LOOK AT THIS WATCH PARTY.
YOUNG UP-AND-COMING GYMNASTS LOOKING AT THEIR ICONS DO THEIR THING.
HOW DO YOU WATCH THAT AND NOT GET A LITTLE TEAR. >> AT SUCH A MOMENT.
IT'S SO INCREDIBLE TO SEE.
>> Reporter: YEAH. WE TEASE EACH OTHER ON THE SHOW. WE LOVED TO TEASE EACH OTHER ON THE SHOW. BUT IT'S AMAZING. AMAZING.
THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN THEY WON THE TEAM GOLD. SHE BECAME THE MOST DECORATED U.S. GYMNASTS OF ALL TIME.
HER TEAMMATES, STANDING, WATCHING. AND THEN THE RESULTS COMING IN.
IT WAS LIKE AMERICANO. IT MADE ME PROUD TO BE AMERICAN. EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT AMERICAN.
STUMBLING A BIT ON THE BAR, BUT THAT'S OKAY. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE.
>> AND IT'S NOT OVER YET.
YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY, BECAUSE NOW THEY WILL COMPETE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL METALS. >> YEAH.
AND WHAT A COMEBACK THAT WOULD BE.
WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED HERE. THEY ARE JUST SO CONFIDENT, SO
STRONG, SO UNITED. AND WHAT WAS REALLY COOL, AS WELL, SEEING THE MEN'S TEAM.
WATCHING, CHEERING, SENDING SUPPORT. THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK FOR FROM THE OLYMPICS.
>> YEAH, THAT'S FOR SURE. AND YOU HAVE VITALS -- BILES
TALKING WITH THEM ABOUT THE TIKTOKS THEY WOULD DO LATER.
AND THE WOMEN'S RUGBY TEAM, GETTING THEIR FIRST OLYMPIC MEDAL EVER. >> RIGHT.
HUGE. THEY BEAT AUSTRALIA. YOU KNOW I LOVE RUGBY. I KNOW YOU KNOW LITTLE BIT
ABOUT RUGBY. >> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
>> Reporter: THAT'S AMAZING. IT WAS A GOOD GAME. WE PLAY OVER HERE.
WINNING TODAY, IN A LOT OF WAYS, THAT'S VERY FRUSTRATING. YOU WIN AND A LOT OF THINGS, AND NOW YOU'VE WON RUGBY.
YEAH. IS FANTASTIC. >> AND LOOK AHEAD A LITTLE BIT
-- >> Reporter: THAT WAS MY ANALYSIS OF RUGBY FOR AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE. DID YOU LIKE THAT?
>> IT WAS PERFECT. YOU ARE, AS YOU SAY, PROUD TO
BE AN AMERICAN, WHICH WE WILL CLIP AND POST IN OUR COMMERCIAL MATERIALS.
IT RAINED OVER THE WEEKEND FOR THE OPENING CEREMONY, THE SCRATCHING OF THE TRIATHLON.
WILL THE SWIMMERS ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO SWIM IN THE RIVER. IT'S POSTPONED I THINK ANOTHER DAY?
WHAT'S THE STATUS? WHAT'S THE UPDATE? >> Reporter: WE DON'T KNOW. IT IS UNDER BITE.
AND JUST TO SAY, I THINK WE SENT THIS YESTERDAY. THEY SAY THIS IS JUST PART OF IT.
THEY SWIM IN OPEN WATERS, SO THEY SOMETIMES GET TOLD THEY CAN'T SWIM. AND THAT'S THE NATURE OF IT.
I WILL TELL YOU, IT IS HOT HERE. I'M KIND OF SWEATING A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE IT'S SO HOT IN
PARIS RIGHT NOW.
SO IT'S GOING TO RAIN AGAIN, MAYBE. THEY NEED TO GET IT DONE BEFORE THE RAIN COMES AGAIN.
AND SEEING ANOTHER PIECE. TOMORROW, I'M HOPING.
I'M CROSSING MY FINGERS. >> I KNOW YOU ARE LOCKED INTO
THE LIVE SHOT CAMERA FOR THE ENTIRE GAME. >> I LOVE TENNIS.
THAT WAS GREAT. I WANT TO GET DOWN TO THE PART OF THE CONCOURSE.
THERE ARE SO MANY AMAZING THINGS HERE. >> EVERY SINGLE DAY, I JUST
WANT THE KEIR SIMMONS FAVORITE UPDATES. SO JUST BE READY FOR IT. LOVE TO SEE IT. HAVE A GOOD TIME.
APPRECIATE IT. >>> LET'S GET TO THE FIVE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW. >>> RULING TODAY A MAN WHOSE
CONVICTION IS OVERTURNED HAS TO STAY BEHIND BARS UNTIL HE IS
RETRIED. HE'S BEEN INCARCERATED FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS FOR MURDER HE SAID HE DID NOT COMMIT.
HE WAS SAID TO BE RELEASED LAST WEEK. THE SUPREME COURT GRANTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REQUEST.
NOW HE MIGHT STAY IN PRISON. SO
MY DETAILS AFTER A LANDSLIDE IN SOUTHERN INDIA.
OBVIOUSLY, THINGS ARE SO UNSTABLE RIGHT NOW THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET IN THERE TO
GET ANY RESCUES. NUMBER THREE, THEY HAD TO BE -- THE SON OF ANGELINA JOLIE AND
BRAD PITT HAVE TO BE HOSPITALIZED. COLLIDING WITH A STOPPED CAR.
THEY DIDN'T SAY WHO WAS INVOLVED.
REPS FOR BOTH OF THE STARS HAVE NOT RESPONDED FOR COMMENT. >>> NOW INVESTIGATING SOME NEW OUTAGES AFFECTING SERVICES
AROUND THE WORLD. EARLIER THIS MONTH, REMEMBER THAT ROUTINE SOFTWARE UPDATE
CAUSING THE GLOBAL I.T. TECH MELTDOWN THAT AFFECTED EVERYTHING TO HOSPITALS, ET
CETERA? THE CAUSE OF THIS ONE? MICROSOFT SAYING SOME SERVICES
ARE ALREADY BACK IN LINE. >>> A WEIGHT-LOSS DRUG SIMILAR
TO OZEMPIC COULD HAVE PROTECTION AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S.
FOR EXAMPLE, SMOKING ADDICTION. ACCORDING TO EARLIER STUDIES, CUTTING THE RISK OF DEMENTIA.
ALSO SOMETHING TO WATCH, TESLA TONIGHT SAYING IT IS RECALLING NEARLY 2 MILLION CARS TO
PREVENT THEIR HEADS FROM POPPING OPEN WHILE THEY ARE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET. FOUND IN THEIR WORDS, LET'S
SWITCH DEFAMATION. OBVIOUSLY BLOCKING SOMEONE'S
VIEWS, CAUSING A BIG SAFETY ISSUE.
WE ARE SHOWING YOU THE MODELS HERE. THE DRIVERS WILL BE NOTIFIED.
I'M JOINED BY NBC'S TOM COSTELLO WHO'S BEEN FOLLOWING THIS. HELP US PUT THIS INTO
CONTEXT. THE YEAR IS ONLY ABOUT HALFWAY OVER. >> LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH. I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS.
WE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS.
CHRYSLERS HAD ABOUT 36, BMW, 17. I GOT A RECALL ON MY CAR FOR
FUEL PUMP ISSUE. THEY WERE WAITING FOR THE PARTS TO COME IN. REALLY IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF
THINGS, IS NOT THAT MUCH. IT CAN BE ANYTHING FROM A SEATBELT LATCH THAT DOESN'T
WORK PROPERLY, IN THIS CASE, THE HOOD LATCH THAT'S NOT
WORKING PROPERLY. BY THE WAY, THE CONSISTENT THEME ACROSS THE RECALL, ALL OF
THE LATCHES WERE MADE IN CHINA. AND THEY THINK THIS AFFECTS 1%
OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT ARE RECALLED. MAINLY ONLY 1% ACTUALLY HAVE AN ISSUE.
>> CRITICISM FOR BEING SPREAD A LITTLE THIN, PERHAPS.
>> YES. THE BORING COMPANIES. >> YEAH, EXACTLY.
WE'VE SEEN A DROP IN WHAT THEY ARE IN HERE.
>> YOU KNOW, I'M KIND OF A GEEKY GUY ON THIS KIND OF STUFF. I LOVE IT. YOU ARE RIGHT. 45%.
THERE YOU GO RIGHT THERE. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL PRETTY HEALTHY.
TODAY BECAUSE OF THE RECALL, DOWN A TOTAL OF 20% SO FAR.
WALL STREET IS KIND OF BETTING RIGHT NOW. WILL THEY BE
SUCCESSFUL IN BECOMING MORE OF AN AI TYPE COMPANY.
AND LISTEN, THERE'S A LOT OF SPACE RIGHT NOW, THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE SPACE. BUT OTHER COMPANIES, AS WELL.
NOT JUST TESLA. THEY ARE BETTING THAT HE IS
GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN TRANSFORMING TESLA INTO SOMETHING MORE THAN JUST THE
BATTERY AND CAR COMPANY. THERE IS ALSO THE TRUMP EFFECT HERE. HE HAS DEFINITELY WRAPPED HIMSELF INTO THE TRUMP ORBIT.
HE HAS ENDORSED TRUMP. HE HAS BEEN PUTTING OUT SOME AI
GENERATED ANTI-HARRIS ADS.
SO THIS CAN GO 1 OF 2 WAYS. THE SIDING NOW, I WILL PROBABLY
GET ONE OF THOSE TESLAS.
SOME OFFENDED BY THAT AY NOT VIA TESLA. >> I MAY NEED A NEW COEXECUTIVE
PRODUCER OF THE SHOW, TOM. A DEEP DIVE OF THE BATTLE OF THE TECH BILLIONAIRES.
>> WHAT A GREAT IDEA I HAD. MET WE ARE AIRING IT IN 10 MINUTES. THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT. >>> IN ADDITION, WE ARE ALSO TAKING YOU TO -- JUSTICE FOR
SONYA MASSEY. HEARING FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE FORMER DEPUTY GETTING
CHARGED WITH HER MURDER. >>> COSTING $1 BILLION, BUT
WHY? â™ª â™ªNOW. >>> LESTER HOLT, AMERICA'S MOST
TRUSTED NEWS ANCHOR.
>>> HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE EXPECTED IN CHICAGO NOT TOO NOW. THE
MOTHER WHO WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY A POLICE OFFICER IN HER OWN HOME EARLIER THIS MONTH. YOU ARE LOOKING AT LIVE PICTURES.
REVEREND AL SHARPTON THERE, AS WELL.
THIS IS BEFORE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE SET TO BEGIN. THE MAN CHARGED WITH KILLING
SONYA MASSEY HAS BEEN FIRED. HE IS PLEADING NOT GUILTY TO CHARGES, INCLUDING FIRST-DEGREE MURDER.
MAGGIE VESPA JOINS US NOW. THE UNION THAT REPRESENTS THAT OFFICER IS CLAIMING TO BE
REINSTATED.
>> Reporter: YEAH, EXACTLY. THAT IS EXACTLY WHY THIS PRESS CONFERENCE WAS SCHEDULED. WE ALREADY KNEW ABOUT A RALLY
LATER ON. YOU JUST SHOWED THE LIVE PICTURE. ONCE THE LABOR COUNCIL FILED
THAT GRIEVANCE SAYING THAT FORMER DEPUTY SHOT GRACIE WAS
FIRED WITHOUT -- AND REINSTATED IN THE WAKE OF SONYA MASSEY'S
DEATH . WE SEEN REVEREND AL SHARPTON.
AND HER MOTHER AND TEENAGE SON. THE FAMILY WILL SAY THEY ARE
ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGED. THAT THE LABOR UNION WOULD AGAIN MAKE THOSE DEMANDS.
THIS WAS THE OUTRAGE WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM THE FAMILY. SHOT IN HER HOME EARLIER THIS
MONTH. SHE IS CALLED 911 ABOUT A POTENTIAL PROWLER.
SHE WAS HOLDING A POT OF BOILING WATER, KIND OF CROUCHED DOWN, BEGGING FOR HER LIFE.
SHE WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN HER OWN HOME.
THE STORY CONTINUES TO UNFOLD LAYER BY LAYER. THE LATEST PIECE OF OUTRAGE WE
ARE SEEING FROM THIS COURT. >> THE ACCOUNTABILITY LENS IS REALLY CRITICAL HERE.
WE'VE ALSO GOT THE SHERIFF NOW APOLOGIZING TO THE COMMUNITY. OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE VERY UPSET.
>> Reporter: IT IS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME HE SPOKEN PUBLICLY.
LAST MONDAY, RELEASING A STATEMENT ON FACEBOOK. BUT WE HADN'T SEEN HIM ON CAMERA. CERTAINLY NOT AT THE POINT OF
300 PEOPLE IN A STATE OF THEM -- STADIUM.
AND HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE SPOKE PUBLICLY, FACING A CROWD OF HUNDREDS.
AND HE APOLOGIZED, SAYING HIS DEPARTMENT HAD FAILED SONYA MASSEY. THIS IS WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT.
>> I SPEAK HER NAME.
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. WE FAILED HER. WE FELT HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
>> Reporter: THAT STATEMENT COMES AFTER WE AND A NUMBER OF JOURNALISTS, UNVEILING WHAT THE
FAMILY CALLS A SERIES OF RED FLAGS. INCLUDING DUI CONVICTIONS IN
2015 AND 2016, AND A NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT AT
PREVIOUS JOBS. THIS LAST ONE, LOGAN COUNTY, ALLEGATIONS THAT HE HAD A
NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT, BUT LEFT THAT JOB IN GOOD STANDINGS. IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT HE KNEW WHEN
HIRING GRAYSON. HE SAYS HE REFUSES TO STEP DOWN IN THE WAKE OF THIS, HAILLE.
>> MAGGIE VESPA, LOTS TO FOLLOW. THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE.
WE COVER HUNDREDS OF STORIES EVERY DAY. BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO READ, WATCH, OR LISTEN TO THE
MALL, OUR TEAMS HAVE DONE THEM FOR YOU. THIS IS A SEGMENT WE CALL THE LOCAL.
META, AGREEING TO PAY MORE THAN $1 BILLION TO SETTLE A LAWSUIT. ACCUSING THEM OF USING FACIAL
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT DATA ON MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION.
>>> ALSO, FIREFIGHTERS IN GEORGIA RESCUING A MAN WHO FELL DOWN THE 50 FOOT WILL.
LITERALLY PULLING UP THE ROPE, GETTING HIM OUT OF THERE. THEY MANAGED TO GET HIM UP SAFELY. OUT OF THE MIDWEST, PLEADING
NOT GUILTY TO DRUG CHARGES IN COURT IN CHICAGO TODAY. L TOPPLES SON -- EL CHAPO SON.
HE WAS ARRESTED EARLIER THIS WEEK. >>> STILL AHEAD, FOLLOWING THE 2024 ELECTION.
>>> TONIGHT'S ORIGINAL NOW WITH IN-DEPTH REPORTING ON A TOPIC WE'VE BEEN WATCHING. TONIGHT, IT'S THE BATTLE OF THE
BILLIONAIRES RIGHT NOW. YOU'VE GOT JD VANCE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN NEVADA TODAY.
WE SAW HIM BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AT A SILICON VALLEY FUNDRAISER.
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO GET MORE SUPPORT FROM TECH GIANTS, AND ON WALL STREET.
ALLIES OF KAMALA HARRIS NOW TRYING TO BRING THEM IN THE
ELECTION FIGHT, BRINGING IN A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. YASMIN VOSSOUGHIAN HAS MORE.
>> MANY ROWS OF THE ELECTION CYCLE SEEM TO BE LEADING BACK
TO THE ULTRA-WEALTHY FAR AWAY FROM WASHINGTON. >> I LOVE ELON MUSK.
>> Reporter: FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, QUOTING THE MEGARICH, TRYING TO GET THEM TO
DUMP BUCKS IN THEIR CAMPAIGN.
ONCE THE ANNOUNCING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL . >> I VOTED FOR HIM TODAY. I'M SORRY I DID THAT.
WE NEED TO HEAL FROM TRUMP. IT WAS REALLY A DEVASTATING BLOW.
>> NOW SAYING HE WILL VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN. HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE TURNING AROUND HIS SUPPORT.
THE FORMER PAYPAL EXEC. AND ROBERT BIGELOW, DAVID --
WHO EVEN GAVE $1 MILLION OF HIS OWN MONEY. WHAT DO BUSINESSMEN HAVE TO GAIN?
>> THIS HAS TURNED INTO BIG MONEY GOING BACK TO TRUMP. TRUMP HAS BEEN SAYING WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR.
HE'S TALKING ABOUT CUTTING THE CORPORATE TAX RATE. TALKING ABOUT SAVING THE MONEY
LONG-TERM. >> Reporter: IN SOME CASES, HELPING SWAY SOME HUGE
DECISIONS. TELLING THE ATLANTIC THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WAS, QUOTE,
CRAZIER,END QUOTE, MORE DANGEROUS THAN HE THOUGHT BACK IN NOVEMBER. BACKUP TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT,
AND ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST, WORKING HARD BEHIND THE SCENES WITH ELON MUSK TO
CONVINCE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO PUT JD VANCE ON THE TICKET.
NBC NEWS REACHED OUT TO THESE BIG REPUBLICAN DONORS FOR COMMENT, BUT HAVE NOT IMMEDIATELY HEARD BACK.
AND IT'S NOT JUST REPUBLICANS TRYING TO COZY UP TO THE MEGA DONORS. KAMALA HARRIS, SHOWING HER
STRENGTH. AND NOW THAT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS OFF THE
TICKET -- TURNING BACK, AFTER REFUSING TO DONATE ANOTHER
DOLLAR IF BIDEN STAYED IN THE RACE. THE CO-FINDER -- COFOUNDER OF
LINKEDIN. NOW ON TRACK TO RAISE $100 MILLION.
>> THE CASE WE ARE HEARING FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT TO COME SUPPORTER OVER TRUMP IS LIKE THIS, SHE'S WILLING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH CEOS.
BIDEN DIDN'T ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THEY WOULD HAVE THOSE TALKS FOR HIM.
>> Reporter: THE MONEY, CRUCIAL. >> THERE HAVE BEEN OVER $100
MILLION PUT INTO FUTURE ADD -- FUTURE ADS IN THE BUSINESS.
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF THIS MONEY. >> SHOWING IMPORTANT, THE INFLUENCE AND POWER THE BIG
MONEY DONORS SEALED WITH LESS THAN 100 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION. >> SO WHAT'S NEXT BETWEEN NOW
AND NOVEMBER? >> MONEY TALKS. THAT'S POLITICAL POWER. AND WE JUST ARE THERE, RIGHT?
INFLUENCING, GETTING JD VANCE ON THE TICKET. TALKING TO HIM ABOUT MAKING HIM HIS VICE RESIDENT.
BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ATTACK ADS. WE CAN'T UNDERSCORE HOW MUCH MONEY.
AND WE KNOW THIS, RIGHT? THEY ARE VYING FOR THESE MEGA DONORS. BUT THIS YEAR, BECAUSE IT'S
SUCH A SHORT RUNWAY UNTIL NOVEMBER WITH, THE HARRIS AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET.
LET'S NOT FORGET BECAUSE KAMALA HARRIS DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
THEY ARE GETTING THESE ATTACK ADS IN THE NEXT 100 DAYS.
AND THEY ARE KIND OF RETHINKING THEIR STRATEGY, AS WELL. LOOKING AT MY EMAIL 30 MINUTES
AGO, DONALD TRUMP ROLLING OUT YET ANOTHER ATTACK AD TO KAMALA HARRIS ON THE BORDER.
THAT'S WHY MONEY IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO BOTH THESE CAMPAIGNS. AND HOW WE WILL SEE IT PLAY OUT OVER THE NEXT 100 DAYS OR SO.
>> GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON THAT . >> WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA TO BE A SAFER
PLACE? >> WEEKDAYS FROM 12:00 TO 4:00 ON NBC NEWS NOW.
>>> FEDERAL REGULATORS TAKING AIM AT AMAZON, SAYING THEY CAN BE HELD LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
SELLING A BUNCH OF STUFF THAT DOESN'T WORK, I MIGHT EVEN BE HAZARDOUS. EVEN WHEN THE STUFF THEY ARE
SELLING COMES FROM A THIRD PARTY VENDOR. UNDER THIS NEW RULE, AMAZON
WILL HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO RECALL THAT FAULTY STUFF. NBC'S MORGAN CHESKY, WHO'S BEEN
DIGGING INTO THIS. AND IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE IF YOU BUY SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T
WORK, THEY HAVE TO MAKE IT RIGHT. >> THAT'S FAIR, BUT IT COULD CHANGE HOW THEY DO BUSINESS
FROM HERE, GOING FORWARD. AND THEY'VE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM FOR YEARS NOW.
AMAZON HAS TRIED TO MAINTAIN THAT THEY ARE NEARLY A CONGEE WENT TO THE GOODS AND SERVICES
SOLD ON AMAZON. THAT WAS NOT THE FINDINGS OF THAT AGENCY TODAY, WHERE THEY
SAID EXPLICITLY THAT IT FITS SQUARELY IN THE DEFINITION OF A DISTRIBUTOR OF GOODS.
SO THEY BEAR LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR RECALL.
AS YOU MENTIONED, HAVING TO MAKE RIGHT BY THE CONSUMER, BY THE CUSTOMER, AND YOU MENTIONED
THIS THIRD-PARTY SELLER. THIS BUSINESS HAVE EXPLODED OVER THE PAST YEAR IN
PARTICULAR, HAILLE. IN FACT, THE NUMBER IS QUITE STAGGERING HERE.
ABOUT 60% OF AMAZON e-COMMERCE COMES EXPLICITLY FROM THESE THIRD-PARTY SELLERS.
AND THESE ARE THE GOODS WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT. THAT IT COULD BE COUNTERFEIT,
UNSAFE, OR EVEN EXPIRED. THOSE ARE THE ONES THEY ARE TRYING TO HOLD AMAZON
ACCOUNTABLE FOR. HAILLE?
>> THEY BASICALLY TRY TO DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS A GO- BETWEEN BETWEEN THIS PERSON AND SHOPPERS.
THAT THEY ARE THE PERSON PASSING ALONG THE GOODS, RIGHT? >> RIGHT. AND THEY SAY AND SPITE OF THIS,
SAYING THAT AMAZON STANDS BEHIND THE SAFETY OF EVERY PRODUCT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
IT'S SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OR A THIRD-PARTY SELLER. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF DEJA VU
ON BOTH SIDES. BACK IN 2021, THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION HAD AMAZON UPDATE IT'S RETURN POLICY
, SUING THEM AND RECALLING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS THAT THEY DEEMED HAZARDOUS.
THEY HAD TO DEAL WITH MORE THAN 400,000 GOODS.
AMONG THOSE, KIND OF SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, HAIRDRYERS WITHOUT ELECTROCUTION PROTECTION, AND
SLEEPWEAR THAT POSE THE BURN RISK. THAT WAS BACK IN 2021. AMAZON WAS OFFERING CREDITS FOR
THAT. THE AGENCY, SAYING THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.
THEY SHOULD HAVE OFFERED A FULL REFUND GOING FORWARD. >> MORGAN CHESKY, THANK YOU FOR THAT RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU
