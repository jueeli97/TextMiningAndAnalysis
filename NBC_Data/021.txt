IN MORE THAN 50 YEARS.
AND THAT IS NOT ALL.
WE ARE BREAKING DOWN EVERYTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU
FLY.
>>> GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
I'M JOE FRYER.
SAVANNAH SELLERS IS ON
ASSIGNMENT.
WE BEGIN WITH THE ATTACK ON THE
FRANCH FRENCH HIGH-SPEED
NETWORK.
THIS AS THE OPENING CEREMONY IN
PARIS SET FOR HOURS AWAY.
THE NETWORK WAS TARGETED BY
VANDALS OVERNIGH
IN A COORDINATED ARSON ATTACK
THAT DAMAGED ITS FACILITY IN A
NUMBER OF LOCATIONS.
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 800,000
TRAVELERS WILL BE AFFECTED OVER
THE COMING WEEKEND AS CREWS
RACED TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE.
>> HUNDREDS OF PASSENGERS WERE
SEEN STRANDED AT ONE OF THE
MAIN STATIONS WAITING FOR
UPDATES AFTER MANY TRAINS WERE
CANCELED OR DELAYED.
>> THIS AHEAD OF THE OPENING
CEREMONY IN PARIS.
THOUSANDS EXPECTED TO TRAVEL TO
THE EVENT BY TRAIN.
OUR NBC NEWS INTERNATIONAL
CORRESPONDENT JOINS US WITH
MORE ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY.
GOOD MORNING.
BRING US UP TO SPEED ON WHAT
AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING ABOUT
THIS ATTACK AND HOW IT IS
IMPACTING THE REAL NETWORK AND
WHO MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE?
>> THE ORGANIZED CRIME UNIT IS
TAKING THE LEAD.
SO FAR, NO ONE HAS TAKEN
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS.
THERE IS NO INDICATION OF
TERRORISM AT THIS STAGE BUT IT
IS A REALLY.
THE ATTACK PARALYZED MUCH OF
THE COUNTRY'S HIGH-SPEED RAIL
NETWORK AS HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS ARE SET TO TRAVEL
TODAY TO KICK OFF SUMMER
VACATIONS AS WELL AS TRAVEL TO
PARIS FOR THE OLYMPICS.
THE FRENCH TRANSPORT MINISTER
SAID IT HAPPENED AT 4:00 IN THE
MORNING AND THAT THIS WAS A
SERIES OF COORDINATED ATTACKS
AFFECTING THE ATLANTIC, THE
NORTH AND THE EAST.
THE HEAD OF THE REAL NETWORK IN
FRANCE CALLED IT A MASSIVE
ATTACK SAYING THAT THE FIBER
OPTIC TABLES AT THREE LOCATIONS
WERE SET ON FIRE.
THEY SAID ONE ATTACK WAS
FOILED.
THE ATTACK ON THE SOUTHWESTERN
LINE.
THE OTHER LINES ARE PRETTY MUCH
PARALYZED.
THEY SAY THE ATTACKS WERE
PREMEDITATED, COORDINATED AND
WITH THE INTENTION TO CAUSE
MASSIVE DISRUPTIONS TO THE
NETWORK.
AND THIS COMES AS THE OPENING
DAY IS STARTING HOURS AWAY.
SECURITY IS EXTREMELY TIGHT IN
PARIS AND GETTING TIGHTER.
POLICE ARE NOW REINFORCING
SECURITY AT TRAIN STATIONS IN
THE CITY.
>> DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW
THIS WILL IMPACT THE OPENING
CEREMONY?
AND DO OFFICIALS HOPE THEY CAN
GET THINGS UP AND RUNNING
QUICKLY?
>> THEY SAY THEY ARE WORKING
VERY QUICKLY TO FIX THE DAMAGE.
THEY SAY LIKELY WILL TAKE A
COUPLE OF DAYS AND THROUGHOUT
THE WEEKEND.
THE OLYMPIC ORGANIZERS SAY THE
OPENING CEREMONY WILL GO AHEAD
AS PLANNED.
THIS IS WHAT THE SPORTS
MINISTER SAID A SHORT TIME AGO.
>> WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING
SOLUTIONS.
IT IS HUGE WORK.
WE ARE PREPARED FOR ALL
SCENARIOS.
>> THEY HAVE BLANKETED PARIS
WITH SECURITY.
45,000 POLICE OFFICERS
INCLUDING 650 SPECIALIST
OFFICERS WITH TACTICAL UNITS
AND EVEN AN ARMY BATTALION
SECURING A MILITARY ZONE.
>> PUTTING THIS TO THE SIDE,
WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM
TONIGHT'S OPENING CEREMONY?
I KNOW FOLKS IN THE STATES ARE
GETTING VERY EXCITED.
WHAT DO ORGANIZERS HAVE IN
STORE FOR US?
>> IT WILL BE PRETTY
SPECTACULAR.
FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT WON'T
TAKE PLACE IN A STADIUM.
ANOTHER FIRST IS THAT IT IS
OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
IT IS EXPECTED TO DRAW THE
BIGGEST CROWD EVER.
100 BOATS CARRYING MORE THAN
10,000 ATHLETES CRUISING DOW
PAST SOME OF THE MOST FAMOUS
LANDMARKS INCLUDING THE
PARTIALLY RESTORED NOTRE DAME
CATHEDRAL AND THE LOUVRE.
LEBRON JAMES AND COCO GAUFF
WILL BE FLAG BEARERS FOR TEAM
USA.
LADY GAGA AND CELINE DION BOTH
RUMORED TO BE PERFORMING.
AND I WILL BE AMONG THE 1.5
BILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
TUNING IN TONIGHT.
>> I CANNOT WAIT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
APPRECIATE YOU KICKING US OFF
THIS HOUR.
WITH THE OPENING CEREMONY SET
TO KICK OFF SOON AND SOME
EVENTS TAKING PLACE OUTDOORS,
WE THOUGHT, WHAT WILL THAT
ATHLETES EXPECT WEATHER WISE?
WE HAVE A LOOK AT THAT
FORECAST.
GOOD MORNING.
>> REPORTER: SO EXCITING.
I WISH WE HAD BETTER NEWS.
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE CHANCE OF
RAIN.
WE HAVE A THREAT FOR RAIN FOR
THE OPENING CEREMONY, THE
PARADE OF NATIONS.
AND THEN THINGS START TO
IMPROVE.
WE ARE LOOKING AHEAD TO THE
SEVEN-DAY FORECAST.
FIRST WE ARE LOOKING AT THE
TRAILING COLD FRONT.
THE UK, NORTHERN FRANCE AS WELL
INCLUDING PARIS AND GERMANY.
THE RAIN IS SLOWLY MOVING SOUTH
AND EAST.
WE HAVE DRIZZLE AND A THREAT
FOR SHOWERS AND HEAVIER
DOWNPOURS. SOMETHING TO KEEP
IN MIND.
WE HAVE A BIG EXTRAVAGANZA
PLANNED.
I'M SURE THEY ARE HOPING WE
WON'T GET A LOT OF RAIN BUT WE
DO HAVE THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS.
WARMER TEMPERATURES IN THE 70s.
7:30 P.M.
AT PARIS TIME IS WHEN IT
STARTS.
1:30 P.M.
IS WHEN WE CAN EXPECT IT.
WE HAVE A LOT OF EVENTS
HAPPENING SATURDAY AS WELL.
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE CHANCE
FOR LIGHT RAIN THROUGHOUT THE
DAY.
ATHLETES WOULD BE HAPPY WITH
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW 70s.
THEN WE DRY OUT AND WARM UP AS
WELL GOING TOWARD THE END OF
THE WEEKEND.
ON SUNDAY, DRY CONDITIONS.
MOSTLY SUNNY.
TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S AND
THEN WE WARM-UP.
WE ARE LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES
MONDAY IN THE UPPER 80S.
SUNNY AND HOT BUT DRY.
TEMPERATURES IN THE 90S.
AND GOODBYE WEDNESDAY, A FRONT
THAT WILL BRING BACK THE CHANCE
OF THUNDERSTORMS AND LIGHTNING
INTO THE FORECAST.
AND WE ARE WARM STILL WITH
TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S.
THURSDAY LOOKING NICE WITH LOW
80S.
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.
THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL WATCH
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS.
THIS CEREMONY WILL BE SO
EXCITING AND SO DIFFERENT FROM
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN.
WE DO HAVE THE CHANCE FOR
SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST.
>> MICHELLE, WE WILL CHECK
BACK WITH YOU AND A LITTLE BIT.
WE WILL SEE YOU IN A SECOND.
>> YOU CAN TUNE INTO THE
OPENING CEREMONY TONIGHT ON NBC
AND STREAMING ON PEACOCK AT
7:30 P.M.
EASTERN TIME AND 6:30 P.M.
CENTRAL.
>>> TURNING TO WASHINGTON,
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU WRAPPED UP HIS
CONTROVERSIAL VISIT TO CAPITOL
HILL, PART OF HIS PUSH FOR
CONTINUED U.S. SUPPORT IN THE
WAR WITH HAMAS.
YESTERDAY, THE PRIME MINISTER
MET WITH BOTH PRESIDENT BIDEN
AND PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS
THAT TWO SEPARATE MEETINGS A
DAY AFTER THE FIERY ADDRESS TO
CONGRESS.
HARRIS ECHOED THE PRESIDENT ON
THE NEED TO END THE WAR AND
BRING HOSTAGES HOME.
>> IT IS TIME FOR THE WARD TO
END AND END IN A WAY WHERE
ISRAEL IS SECURE AND ALL THE
HOSTAGES ARE RELEASED AND THE
SUFFERING OF PALESTINIANS IN
GAZA ENDS AND THE PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE CAN EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT
TO FREEDOM, DIGNITY AND SELF
DETERMINATION.
>> THE MOOD ON CAPITOL HILL
WAS INTENSE THROUGHOUT THE
PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT.
SEVERAL DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS
PROTESTED THE SPEECH.
A CONGRESSWOMAN, ONLY
PALESTINIAN AMERICAN WOMAN
SERVING IN CONGRESS BROUGHT
THESE SIGNS TO BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU'S ADDRESS.
SHE WAS ONE OF SEVERAL
LAWMAKERS SPEAKING OUT.
AND SAYING IT WAS THE WORST
PRESENTATION OF ANY FOREIGN
UNITARY.
>> OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF
CAPITOL HILL, THOUSANDS
GATHERED TO PROTEST BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU'S CONDUCT IN THE WAR
AGAINST HAMAS.
SOME CLASHED AND BURNED AMERICAN
FLAGS.
>> THE TEAM JOINING US THIS
MORNING TO BREAK DOWN THE
HISTORIC VISIT INCLUDING NBC
NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT
AND INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT
SANCHEZ WHO IS IN TEL AVIV.
SO NETANYAHU MET WITH PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND VP HARRIS YESTERDAY.
WHAT DO WE HEAR CAME OUT OF
THOSE MEETINGS AND HOW DID THE
WHITE HOUSE STAGE-MANAGED THIS
MOMENT GIVEN THAT HARRIS IS
EXPECTED TO BECOME THE OFFICIAL
NOMINEE.
AND INNOCENCE, A LAME-DUCK
PRESIDENT WITH SIX MONTHS LEFT
IN HIS TERM.
>> I THINK STAGE-MANAGED IS
THE RIGHT TERM TO USE.
IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT TO
MEET WITH A VISITING HEAD OF
STATE SEPARATELY.
THE OTHER THING DIFFERENT HERE
IS THE VICE PRESIDENT IS THE
ONE WHO MADE THE STATEMENT.
THIS IS PART OF THE CAREFUL
CHOREOGRAPHY THE WHITE HOUSE IS
HAVING TO DO.
THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE
HOUSE ARE VERY MUCH IN THE
MINDSET THAT THERE IS ONE
PRESIDENT AT A TIME IN THIS
COUNTRY.
THAT IS SOMETHING WE HEARD
REPEATEDLY AS THERE WAS A
TRANSITION FROM THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION TO THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION.
SO THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE
PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD TIME TO
MEET WITH THE PRIME MINISTER
AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SPEND
TIME TOGETHER AND HAVE A
CONVERSATION.
BOTH THE PRESIDENT AND VICE
PRESIDENT INDICATED THEY TALKED
ABOUT THE NEED FOR GETTING A
DEAL DONE AND ARRIVING AT A
CEASE-FIRE AND GETTING HOSTAGES
OUT OF GAZA AS WELL AS GETTING
MORE HELP TO THE PEOPLE OF GAZA
STILL SUFFERING.
THAT IS REALLY THE RESULT OF
WHAT CAME OUT OF THE MEETING.
THERE WAS NOT MUCH READ OUT IN
TERMS OF WHAT THEY DISCUSSED OR
THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESSING
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU TO GET
THE DEAL FINISHED AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE.
>> WE KNOW THE SPEECH WAS MET
WITH MAJOR PROTESTS IN THE U.S.
HEADED FOLKS IN ISRAEL RESPOND?
>> ISRAEL IS A POLITICALLY
DIVIDED COUNTRY JUST LIKE THE
UNITED STATES.
THE NETANYAHU SUPPORTERS ON THE
POLITICAL RIGHT OF THE COUNTRY,
IT WAS A REMINDER OF BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU'S STRENGTH.
HE PRESENTS HIMSELF AS THE ONLY
ISRAELI LEADER WITH A STATURE
THAT COMMANDS RESPECT IN
WASHINGTON THAT CAN ADDRESS A
JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS FOR
NEARLY AN HOUR AND PERFECT
ENGLISH AND RECEIVE 50 PLUS
STANDING OVATIONS.
FOR MANY OF THE HOSTAGE
FAMILIES, THERE IS DEEP
FRUSTRATION THAT THE PRIME
MINISTER DID NOT HAVE VERY MUCH
TO SAY IT ALL ABOUT GETTING TO
A DEAL TO BRING LOVED ONES HOME
AFTER NEARLY 300 DAYS. THE
FATHER OF ONE OF THE AMERICAN
ISRAELI HOSTAGES SAID IT WAS
BASICALLY POLITICATHEATER AND
THAT THIS WAS NETANYAHU SHOWING
OFF TO A DOMESTIC POLITICAL
AUDIENCE.
REMEMBER THAT HE IS WAY DOWN IN
THE POLLS.
EVEN SOME PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT,
HIS NATURAL POLITICAL
SUPPORTERS, BLAME HIM FOR THE
FAILURES LEADING UP TO THE
OCTOBER 7 TERROR ATTACK.
HOSTAGE FAMILIES WANT HEAR MORE
ABOUT BRINGING LOVED ONES BACK
AND NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY
REALLY HEARD MUCH DETAIL ABOUT
THE FUTURE OF GAZA AND WHO WILL
GOVERN IT AFTER THIS WAR AND
CRUCIALLY, WHO WILL PAY FOR THE
ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE
RECONSTRUCTION EFFORT?
>> YOU MENTIONED A CEASE-FIRE
DEAL.
WERE TO BE STAND WITH
NEGOTIATIONS RIGHT NOW?
WE KNOW THAT HERE, FAMILIES OF
THE HOSTAGES MET WITH NETANYAHU
AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
HOW ARE THEY REACTING TO ALL OF
THIS?
>> WE DID NOT GET MUCH DETAIL
EITHER ABOUT WHERE EXACTLY THE
NEGOTIATIONS AND STAND AT THIS
POINT.
WE KNOW THERE HAD BEEN SORT OF
A PAUSE OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND
VISITING HERE IN THE STATE.
THE UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE FROM
THE WHITE HOUSE IS THAT THIS
MEETING BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT
AND THE PRIME MINISTER, THE
PURPOSE WAS TO FILL IN THE
FINAL HOSTAGE DEAL.
THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT
THERE WILL BE SOME MOVEMENT OR
CONTINUED MOVEMENT IN MAKING
SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS.
WE DID HEAR FROM THE FAMILIES
THAT MET WITH THE PRESIDENT.
ABOUT 12 PEOPLE MET WITH THE
PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME
MINISTER FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR IN
THE WHITE HOUSE, BOTH OF THEM
TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME.
THE INDICATION WE GET FROM THE
FAMILIES AFTER THE MEETING WAS
THAT THEY FELT AS THOUGH THEY
GOT A COMMITMENT FROM BOTH THE
PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME
MINISTER THAT THEY UNDERSTAND
THE URGENCY OF THE MOMENT.
THAT IS THE PHRASE SOME OF THE
FILM IS USED IN TALKING ABOUT
THE MEETING THEY HAD WITH THE
PRESIDENT AND THE PRIME
MINISTER.
THEY ALSO SAID THEY FEEL MORE
OPTIMISTIC THAN PERHAPS THEY
DID SINCE THE BEGINNING, SINCE
THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS A DEAL
THAT GOT SOME HOSTAGES OUT OF
GAZA.
SO INDICATION THAT THERE IS
SOME MOVEMENT HAPPENING.
AS WE HEARD OVER AND OVER, IT
IS NOT DONE.
>> SPEAKING OF HOSTAGES, WE
SHOULD NOTE ISRAELI FORCES SAID
THEY RECOVERED THE BODIES OF
FIVE HOSTAGES FROM TUNNELS.
ONE MORE THING.
NETANYAHU IS EXPECTED TO MEET
WITH TRUMP LATER TODAY AT MAR-A-
LAGO.
ANY IDEA WHAT THOSE TWO ARE
EXPECTED TO TALK ABOUT?
>> THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP THAT
HAS SUFFERED SOME DAMAGE.
WE KNOW THAT RIGHT AFTER
PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS ELECTED AND
TAKING OFFICE, THE PRIME
MINISTER CONGRATULATED HIM ON
HIS WIN AND FORMER PRESIDENT
TRUMP SAID THAT NETANYAHU WAS
UPSET.
BOTH OF THESE MEN HAVE AN
INTEREST IN THIS.
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP COULD BE
PRESIDENT AGAIN.
SO THE PRIME MINISTER HAS AN
INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT
THE RELATIONSHIP CAN SEE SOME
STABILITY AGAIN.
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS AN
INTEREST IN LOOKING AS THOUGH
HE CAN STAND ON A WORLD STAGE.
AND THAT IS PART OF WHAT THE
MEETING WILL BE ABOUT LATER ON
TODAY.
>> THANK YOU BOTH.
>>> VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS THIS
MORNING IS GETTING BIG TIME
SUPPORT FROM SOME BIG NAMED
DEMOCRATS IN HER PRESIDENTIAL
BID.
>> WE CALLED TO SAY THAT
MICHELLE AND I COULD NOT BE
MORE PROUD TO ENDORSE YOU AND
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET YOU
THROUGH THIS ELECTION AND INTO
THE OVAL OFFICE.
>> THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.
>> THE VIDEO RELEASED TODAY
SHOWS FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA CALLING TO PLEDGE HIS
SUPPORT TO THE VICE PRESIDENT
NOTING THAT HIS WIFE MICHELLE
IS ALSO ENDORSING HARRIS.
THEY DISCUSSED HAVING THEM
APPEAR TOGETHER ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL.
THIS ACCORDING TO THREE SOURCES
FAMILIAR WITH THE DISCUSSIONS.
PETER ALEXANDER HAS THE LATEST
ON THE RACE FOR THE WHITE
HOUSE.
>> VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS
WELCOMING AND ON STAGE SHOWDOWN
WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP
ACCUSING HIM OF BACKPEDALING
FROM HIS PREVIOUS COMMITMENT TO
THE SEPTEMBER DEBATE.
>> I THINK THE VOTERS DESERVE
TO SEE THIS ON A DEBATE STAGE.
>> JUST THIS WEEK, MR. TRUMP
SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING TO DO
MORE THAN ONE DEBATE WITH MS.
HARRIS.
>> I DO WANT TO DEBATE HER.
SHE WILL BE NO DIFFERENT.
THEY HAVE THE SAME POLICIES.
>> HEAD-TO-HEAD AS QUICKLY
HEATING UP.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS NARROWED
THE ADVANTAGE.
THE RACE EFFECTIVELY A TOSSUP
ON THE ECONOMY, HARRIS SLAMMING
THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S
PROPOSALS AS TAX
CUTS FOR BILLIONAIRES.
>> WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE
ARE NOT GOING BACK.
>> MR. TRUMP ATTACKING THE
VICE PRESIDENT.
>> SHE IS THE MOST RADICAL
PERSON PROBABLY THAT WE HAVE
HAD AN OFFICE LET ALONE THE
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY.
>> AND CASTING ASIDE HIS
PROMISE FROM LAST WEEK'S
CONVENTION THAT HE WOULD STRIKE
A MORE UNIFYING
TONE.
>> IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'M NOT
GOING TO BE NICE.
>> THIS COMES AS PRESIDENT
BIDEN DETAILED HIS DECISION TO
DROP OUT OF THE RACE.
>> DISCUSSING HIS DESIRE TO
UNITE THE COUNTRY BY PASSING
THE TORCH TO A NEW GENERATION.
>> IT IS A PLACE FOR NEW
VOICES, FRESH VOICES AND
YOUNGER VOICES.
>> IN THE SELECTION, WE EACH
FACE A QUESTION.
>> THE HARRIS TEAM RUNNING
WITH ITS FIRST CAMPAIGN VIDEO.
TO THE BEYONCI SONG, "FREEDOM."
AND JD VANCE IS FACING A
BACKLASH FOR HIS PAST CRITICISM
OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS INCLUDING
MS. HARRIS, FOR NOT HAVING
CHILDREN.
>> HOLLYWOOD STAR JENNIFER
ANISTON POSTING "ALL I CAN SAY
MR. VANCE, IS I PRAY YOUR
DAUGHTER IS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO
BARE CHILDREN OF HER OWN ONE
DAY."
IS THE SECOND TO NONE'S WIFE
PRAYS TO THE VICE PRESIDENT AS
A COPARENT TO THE DOUG EMHOFF
CHILDREN.
>> I LOVE OUR BLENDED FAMILY
AND I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVE HER
AND IT.
>> WE ARE IN THE EARLY DAYS OF
THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN AND WE ARE
EMBRACING A DIFFERENT APPROACH
WITH BOTH STYLE AND STRATEGY.
THE YOUNGER CANDIDATE IS VICE
PRESIDENT AND EMBRACES POP
CULTURE AN APPEAL TO YOUNGER
VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN LESS
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT PRESIDENT
BIDEN.
STRATEGICALLY PERHAPS A
DIFFERENT ELECTORAL MAP.
AND MOBILIZING DIFFERENT
DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDING SOUTHERN
BLACK VOTERS IN STATES LIKE
GEORGIA WHERE VICE PRESIDENT
HARRIS WILL HEAD NEXT WEEK.
>>> ONE OF THE BIG QUESTION
THAT REMAINS IN THE
PRESIDENTIAL RACE IS WHICH
CANDIDATE WILL GET THE SUPPORT
FROM VOTERS WHO AT ONE TIME
BACK TO NIKKI HALEY?
THIS DRAMATIC SHIFT, WILL THEY
STICK WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
OR GIVE POMELO HARRIS -- ,
HERE'S A CHANCE.
>> TWO DAYS AFTER PRESIDENT
BIDEN STEPPED ASIDE AND
ENDORSED HARRIS.
LET'S BRING IN OUR POLITICAL
EDITOR MARK MURRAY.
WHAT DOES THE GROUP HAVE TO SAY
ABOUT EIGHT TRUMP HARRIS
MATCHUP?
>> AND BEESON'S WAS ABLE TO
OBSERVE A FOCUSED GROUP OF 15
DIFFERENT NIKKI HALEY VOTERS
WHO VOTED FOR HER DURING THE
PRIMARY SEASON.
SOME OF THEM HAD SOME NICE
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT VICE
PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS.
SOME HAD TOUGH THINGS TO SAY
ABOUT HER.
BUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING WAS
ALL OF THEM SAID THEY WANTED TO
HEAR MORE.
THAT SHE IS NOT REALLY DEFINED
FOR THEM.
AND I WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR
THE PARIS CAMPAIGN THE NEXT
THREE AND HALF MONTHS.
AND OVERALL WHEN IT COMES TO
VOTE SUPPORT, YOU END OF HAVING
THREE OF THESE NIKKI HALEY
VOTERS THAT SAID THEY WOULD
VOTE FOR KAMALA HARRIS.
ABOUT FIVE OR SIX SAID THEY
WOULD VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP AND
THE REST ENDED UP SAYING THEY
WOULD VOTE THIRD PARTY OR NOT
AT ALL.
>> WE KNOW FOR THESE NIKKI
HALEY VOTERS, AGE IS A BIG
FACTOR IN THE RACE BETWEEN
PRESIDENT BIDEN AND DONALD
TRUMP.
ON ELECTION DAY, THERE WILL BE
AN 18 YEAR GAP BETWEEN HARRIS
AND TRUMP.
HOW IMPORTANT OF AN ISSUE IS
THIS?
>> THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT CAME
UP IN THE FOCUS GROUP.
WE DO HAVE THE NEW DYNAMIC OF
JOE BIDEN NOT BEING THE
PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT THE FOCUS
GROUP RESPONDENTS HAD TO SAY.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AGE
ISSUE FOR A MOMENT.
NOW THAT BIDEN IS OUT OF THE
RACE, IS IT PERSUASIVE FOR
DEMOCRATS TO ARGUE THAT TRUMP,
AT THE AGE OF 78, WOULD BE THE
OLDEST PERSON EVER INAUGURATED?
>> THE AGE IS A LEGITIMATE
CONCERN.
AND IS A TIME FOR NEW
GENERATIONS OF LEADERS TO TAKE
OVER.
>> WHO THINKS THIS IS A
PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT?
>> TELL ME VERY QUICKLY IN THE
INTEREST OF TIME, WHAT PART DO
YOU AGREE WITH?
>> I AGREE IT IS TIME FOR NEW,
YOUNGER LEADERSHIP.
>> THEY WERE BOTH TOO OLD IN
THE FIRST PLACE AND WE NEED A
NEW GENERATION OF POLITICAL
LEADERS.
>> THE WORLD THEY ARE GOING
THROUGH, I CANNOT IMAGINE.
JUST THE TOPICS AND ISSUES ARE
SO MUCH DIFFERENT AND HAVE TO
BE HANDLED SO MUCH
DIFFERENTLY.
>> AS YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING,
AGE IS A FACTOR BUT NOT THAT
BIG OF A FACTOR.
ONE OF THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS IS
THAT IT WAS CONDUCTED AFTER SO
MANY BIG EVENTS LIKE THE
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON DONALD
TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION AND JOE BIDEN
LEAVING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.
HOW A LOT OF PERCEPTIONS HAVE
NOT CHANGED DESPITE ALL THE A
PEOPLE WE HAVE SEEN.
>> AMAZING.
MARK MURRAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> EARLIER WE WERE IN A
WEATHER FOR PARIS.
LET'S SHOW YOU WHAT TO EXPECT
ON THE SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC.
THE SOUTH WILL SEE HEAVY RAIN.
TEMPERATURES IN THE 90S AND THE
MIDWEST.
>> THAT IS RIGHT.
WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT CONTINUED
UNSETTLED SALT.
SHOWERS AND STORMS HIT SOME
COULD BRING HEAVY RAINFALL.
WERE LOOKING AT THE CHANCE OF
FLOODING AND THAT INCLUDES
FLASH FLOODING.
THIS IS WHAT THE RADAR LOOKS
LIKE NOW.
YOU CAN SEE THE DARKER RETURNS
OF THE RED, ORANGE AND YELLOW.
THAT IS WHERE WE SEE THE
HEAVIEST RAIN FALLING.
SO PORTIONS OF LOUISIANA AND
EASTERN TEXAS AND INTO
TENNESSEE AND THEN ALONG THE
CAROLINAS.
THAT IS SOMETHING WE WILL SEE
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND ENDED
THE WEEKEND AS WELL.
THE GULF COAST, THE SOUTHEAST
ON THE CAROLINAS COULD SEE
HEAVY RAIN.
THIS ALL BECAUSE OF THE COLD
FRONT BRINGING SHOWERS AND
STORMS.
SO ANOTHER UNSETTLED DAY AND
ANOTHER UNSETTLED WEEKEND.
WE ARE NOT WORRIED ABOUT SEVERE
WEATHER ALTHOUGH WE COULD SEE
GUSTY THUNDERSTORMS.
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WILL BE
FLOODING IN SPOTS AS WE SEE
HEAVY DOWNPOURS WITH A LOT OF
MOISTURE IN THE AIR.
AND SOME FLOODING CONDITIONS.
SATURDAY, MORE SCATTERED
SHOWERS ALONG THE GULF COAST.
AREAS OF RAINFALL ENTERING THE
MIDWEST.
THE BIG STORY WILL BE THE
WARMER TEMPERATURES.
TELNET 10 MILLION PEOPLE IN
EASTERN TEXAS ARE AFFECTED
INCLUDING THE CAROLINAS AND
MYRTLE BEACH.
WHERE YOU SEE THE RED AS A
FLASH FLOOD WARNING.
WE ARE SEEING FLOODING
HAPPENING NOW.
THAT WILL BE THE CASE
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
IT WILL BE MOVING IN FROM TIME
TO TIME.
BE CAREFUL HEADING OUT AND
ABOUT ON THIS FRIDAY.
THE RAINFALL FORECAST, LOOKING
AT A LOT OF RAIN.
WE ARE SEEING THE RED, THE
YELLOW AND ORANGE.
THAT IS WHERE WE ARE EXPECTING
THE HEAVIEST RAIN FROM THE GULF
COAST AND THE SOUTHEAST IN THE
CAROLINAS COAST AS WELL.
OTHERWISE, A NICE DAY IN THE
OHIO VALLEY.
MIDATLANTIC, ON THE WARM SIDE.
VERY SUMMERLIKE TEMPERATURES.
AND HUMIDITY HAS DROPPED.
SO FEELING REALLY NICE.
WARM THROUGHOUT THE MIDWEST AND
THE NORTHERN PLAINS WITH
TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S AND
90S.
WE HAVE A HEAT ALERT FOR FARGO.
AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT FIRE
DANGER OUT WEST.
TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S
