>>> WE BEGIN WITH BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT. THE MAN POLICE SAY INTENTION
AGOLY INTENTIONALLY SEAT RAGING FIRE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH
SARSON. RONNIE DEAN STOUT STARTED THE PARK FIRE BY PUSHING A BURNING CAR INTO A RAVINE LAST WEEK IN
THE CITY OF CHICO WHICH IS ABOUT 90 MINUTES OUTSIDE
SACRAMENTO. THE FIRE HAS BURNED NEARLY
370,000 ACRES, QUICKLY BECOMING CALIFORNIA'S SIXTH LARGEST FIRE IN REPORTED HISTORY.
FIREFIGHTERS SAY IT'S 12% CONTAINED. SOME EVACUATION ORDERS WERE LIFTED, BUT MANY PEOPLE RETURNING TO THEIR HOMES FOUND
SCENES OF TOTAL DEVASTATION. AND UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT COMES
NEXT. >> WE WILL CREATE A LIFE IN ANOTHER PLACE AND TRY TO HOLD ON TO THE JOYS AND MEMORIES AND
GOOD THINGS FOR THIS PLACE. >> STEVE JOINS ME NOW FROM BUTTE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. STEVE, REALLY HEART BREAKING
SCENES OUT THERE THAT DEVASTATION, BUT I WANT TO BEGIN WITH THE BREAKING NEWS. THESE ARE SERIOUS CHARGES THIS SUSPECT IS FACING.
360,000+ acres burned in California park fire
WHAT DID WE LEARN IN COURT TODAY? >> Reporter: YEAH, THEY ARE.
42-YEAR-OLD RONNIE DEAN STOUT II IN FRONT OF A JUDGE THIS AFTERNOON. WE LEARNED MOMENTS AGO THAT
STOUT WILL FACE CRIMINAL ARSON CHARGES. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THOSE CHARGES ARE GOING TO BE. THE ARRAIGNMENT SET FOR
THURSDAY ALTHOUGH HE DID APPEAR BRIEFLY TODAY. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
ESSENTIALLY IS HE GUILTY OF RECKLESSLY COMMITTING ARSON OR IS HE SUSPECTED OF
INTENTIONALLY COMMITTING ARSON. THOSE TWO THINGS WILL DETERMINE SENTENCING FIED LANES AND SEVERITY OF THE CHARGES. HE IS ACCUSED OF WITNESSES SAY,
OF PUTTING SOMETHING IN A CAR, LEAVING THE CAR AND THE CAR LIGHTS ON FIRE AND HE PUSHES IT
IN A RAVINE. ESSENTIALLY, ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, SPARKING A FIRE. NOW THE SIZE OF THE LARGE
AMERICAN CITY. VALLEY. >> HOW ABOUT FIREFIGHTERS? HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE
PROGRESS ON THE FIRE ITSELF? >> Reporter: THEY HAVE. YOU KNOW OVER LAST THREE, FOUR, I WOULD SAY DAYS OR SO, THE
FIRE HAS -- THE WEATHER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY COOLED DOWN. COOLER TEMPERATURES MEANS ESSENTIALLY LESS FIRE DANGER.
THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS. THAT'S WHY THERE'S ANY
CONTAINMENT ON THE FIRE WHATSOEVER. IT IS 12% CONTAINED FOR 360,000 ACRE FIRE, IT TONIGHT SEEM LIKE
MUCH, BUT ANY PROGRESS IS GOOD PROGRESS WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A FIRE THAT MOVED THIS
QUICKLY AND MOVED ON MULTIPLE FRONTS AND SURROUNDING FIREFIGHTERS BECAUSE OF THE
NUMBER OF SPOT FIRES SHOOTING UP. ALMOST GENERATING ITS OWN WEATHER SYSTEM AT CERTAIN
POINTS. THE FIRE MORE PUSHED OFF INTO THE WILDERNESS, AWAY FROM COMMUNITY CENTERS. IT IS THE PRIMARY MISSION OF
FIREFIGHTERS, BUT, AS I SPEAK, IT HAS GOTTEN SIGNIFICANTLY HOTTER AND WILL GET SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WINDY AND
MUCH MORE DRY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS ALL RAISING THE FIRE
DANGER OF A DANGEROUS FIRE FIGHT. VALERIE. >> STEVE, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE HOMEOWNERS YOU INTERVIEWED.
THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS
HAS HAPPENED TO HIM? >> Reporter: I AM STANDING IN WHAT WOULD BE HIS DRIVEWAY.
YOU CAN SEE THE DESTRUCTION. THIS IS A MAN THAT LOST HIS HOME IN THE FIRE IN PARADISE IN
2018. THE CAMPFIRE, DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILD FIRE IN
CALIFORNIA HISTORY. AND THEN BOUGHT THIS HOME, AS WHAT HE CALLS A SILVER LINING. HE STILL WANTED TO STAY IN THIS
EXTREMELY FIRE PRONE AREA OF BUTTE COUNTY. AND THOUGHT HE COULD, BY
ESSENTIALLY BUILDING SOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE FOR HIS HOME. AND THEN A FEW DAYS YOU KNOW, EARLIER, A FEW DAYS AGO, THIS
HOME BURNED TO THE GROUND. YOU KNOW, HARD TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. I GET CHOKED UP BECAUSE OF HOW
EMOTIONAL HE WAS PEP LOST HIS CAT HE RESCUED FROM THE FIRST FIRE, AND WE BELIEVE HAS DIED
IN THIS FIRE. HERE HE IS IN HIS OWN WORDS,
LISTEN. >> IT IS A TURN FOR OUT FUTURE. >> Reporter: IS IT HARD BECAUSE
YOU THOUGHT OF THIS AS YOUR SILVER LINING. >> YES, YES.
THAT'S -- YES. I FIGURED THIS WAS A HOUSE THAT WOULD BE WHEELING ME OUT OF IN MY OLD, OLD AGE AND WE WOULD
TAKE IN SUN SETS. >> Reporter: DIFFICULT STUFF. AND THAT'S SORT WHAT HAVE WE HEARD FROM MANY RESIDENTS IN
THE AREA. THERE'S A COLLECTIVE TRAUMA, BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF FIRE THAT ARE SPARKED OFF IN THE
SPECIFIC PART OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS VERY, YOU KNOW, TOUGH TO HEAR THOSE STORIES, BECAUSE OF
HOW MUCH YOU HEAR THOSE STORIES. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MOVED AWAY, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY WANT TO STICK IT OUT
BECAUSE THIS IS HOME. VALERIE. >> STEVE, SO HEART BREAKING TO HEAR THE STORIES. THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORTING.
>>> BILL, WHAT IS THE NEWS ON THE FORECAST FRONT FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA? >> YEAH, YOU NOTICE BEHIND
STEVE THE TREES WERE NOT BLOWING. IT WAS OBVIOUSLY SUNNY AND DRY. IT'S GOING TO STAY DRY IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG TIME.
BUT IT'S NOT WINDY. AND THAT'S REALLY HELPED OUT FIREFIGHTING EFFORTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS AFTER THE INCREDIBLE SPREAD THAT WE HAD
OVER THE WEEKEND. NOTICE, FIRE STARTED NORTH OF CHICO. AND WINDS 15, AND THIS IS THE AREA THAT IS ROUGHLY BURNED.
IN BETWEEN ALL THE MAJOR CITIES. AND AS FAR AS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH TODAY, WITH THE
IMAGERY, WE CAN SEE THAT THE FIRE HAS NOT BEEN RAPIDLY SPREADING. BUT THERE'S STILL, THESE ARE
THE SMOKE PLUMES AND VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING YOU WHERE THE ACTIVE FIRE FRONTS ARE. THIS IS THE SMOKE THAT BURNED
THIS REGION. AND IT'S THE EASTERN FRONT. THIS IS A LOT OF AREA THAT HAVE NOT BURNED IN OVER 100 YEARS.
SO THERE'S PLENTY OF STUFF TO BURN IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD. RUGGED TERRAIN, TOO. NOT NEAR A LOT OF CITIES AND
TOWNS. THEY MAY HAVE TO LET THAT BURN AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL GET THE RAIN EVENTUALLY TO HELP PUT THE FIRE OUT.
AS FAR AS OTHER CONDITIONS, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE ONLY FIRE. THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER FIRES IN
THE WEST. RED FLAG WARNINGS FOR WYOMING, IDAHO AND UTAH. SO THIS IS WHERE IT IS WINDIER. AND BECAUSE OF THE FIRES THAT
ARE BURNING, AIR QUALITY HAS BEEN A BIG PROBLEM. AND EVEN IN THE EAST, EVEN AS FAR EAST AS CAPE COD OVER THE
WEEKEND, THERE WAS SMOKE THAT BLEW ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE WORST OF THE AIR QUALITY NOW NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, AND
THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARK FIRE. AND THE AREAS TO THE NORTH HERE, ESPECIALLY IN ORGANIZE
OP, IDAHO, AND INTO MONTANA. THE AIR QUALITY PROBLEM EARLIER TODAY WAS HAZARDOUS. AND NOW IT'S CONSIDERED IN THE
RED. WHICH IS UNHEALTHY. BEND AND BOISE THE AIR IS CONSIDERED UNHEALTHY. THERE WILL BE MORE THE DAYS
AHEAD. ED A ADDING UP THE FIRES IN THE LOWER 48, 102 LARGE FIRES.
A SMALL ARMY, 27,000 FIREFIGHTERS ARE ON THESE BLAZES. AND WE HAVE EVACUATIONS NOT
JUST ON THE PARK FIRE BUT 24 OTHER FIRES EVACUATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AND A NEW ONE
IN AREAS OF COLORADO. AND THE FIRE, ALL THAT SMOKE, LATER TONIGHT 8:00 A.M. TOMORROW MORNING, DENSE OVER
AREAS OF MONDAYTON, SOUTHERN IDAHO, AND SOUTH DAKOTA, NORTH DAKOTA. HEADING INTO AREAS OF
MINNESOTA, MINNEAPOLIS, DES MOINES AND CHICAGO, YOUR SUNRISE TOMORROW MORNING, YOU WILL NOTICE THE SMOKE IN THE AIR. SO HOW DID WE SET UP.
IS THIS HIGHLY UNUSUAL, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKED. THIS IS THE NORM. 2022 WAS OUR, AT THIS TIME WE
BURNED 5 MILLION ACRES AND WE PASSED 4 MILLION. SO TWO OF THE LAST THREE YEARS
INCREDIBLY ACTIVE. WHAT WAS UNUSUAL IS LAST YEAR AT THIS POINT, WE BURNED A MILLION. LAST YEAR WE DIDN'T HAVE HARDLY
ANY FIRES. BUT WE ARE WELL ABOVE AVERAGE AND 2021, SIMILAR TO THIS YEAR.
SO THIS IS NOT EXTRAORDINARY. THIS IS BECOME THE NORM. AND IF ANYTHING, LAST YEAR WAS THE YEAR THAT WAS HIGHLY
UNUSUAL BECAUSE WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF FIRES BURNING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. >> BILL, THANKS FOR THE UPDATE.
Potential VP candidates hit trail for Harris
>>> WE ARE LESS THAN 100 DAYS UNTIL THE NOVEMBER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. AND SHOULD FIND OUT WHO KAMALA
HARRIS RUNNING MATE WILL BE WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO. AT LEAST ACCORDING TO HER
CAMPAIGN COCHAIR GRETCHEN WHIT MER WHO SAYS SHE IMAGINATION THAT WILL BE THE CASE.
BOTH GOVERNOR WHIT MER AND JOSH SHAPIRO WERE IN SUBURBAN PHILADELPHIA AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY MAKING THE CASE FOR
KAMALA HARRIS. AND WHIT MER SAYS SHE IS NOT PART OF THE VETTING FOR THE VP
PICK, SHAPIRO SEEMED LIKE HE WAS AUDITIONING FOR THE JOB. >> I WANT A FUTURE THAT IS
CLEANER AND GREENER. I WANT A FUTURE WITH SAFER
STREETS AND BETTER SCHOOLS. I WANT A FUTURE WITH MORE FREEDOM NOT LESS AND I WANT A
FUTURE WHERE I CAN LOOK THE 47th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN THE EYE AND SAY,
HELLO, MADAM PRESIDENT. I HOPE YOU ARE WITH ME.
THANK YOU. >> OKAY. LET'S BRING IN DAS-H-A BURNS. HOW WAS THE ENERGY AT THE
RALLY. SHAPIRO WAS EXCITED. HARRIS WAS NOT THERE HERSELF THOUGH, RIGHT? >> Reporter: YEAH, VALERIE, I GOT TO TELL YOU FOR 5:00 ON A
MONDAY IN THE SUMMER, THE ENERGY THERE WAS PRETTY ELECTRIC. THERE WERE MORE THAN A THOUSAND
PEOPLE AT THE EVENT. AND THEY THERE WERE CHANTS OF WHIT MER AND SHAPIRO. THE CROWD WAS RILED UP.
YOU CAN FEEL A. ABLE SHIFT ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE AISLE SINCE HARRIS HAS TAKEN
THE ROLE AND STEPPED INTO THE TOP OF THE TICKET. AND YOU NOW HAVE A SECOND ROUND
OF VEEP STAKES. YOU HEARD JOSH SHAPIRO ONE OF THE CONTENDERS. SHE DOESN'T HAVE A TON OF TIME
TO MAKE THE DECISION. BUT CERTAINLY, A REAL SHIFT AND CONTROL THEOR JOLT FOR DEMOCRATIC PARTY. >> WHEN IT COME TO THE VEEPS STAKES WHAT ARE VOTERS SAYING
ABOUT THAT? >> Reporter: IN PENNSYLVANIA, YOU HAVE A LOT OF JOSH SHAPIRO FANS AND THERE ARE A UNTIL OF REASONS WHY HE COULD BE A
PROMISING CONTENDER. NUMBER ONE, PENNSYLVANIA. AND THAT'S A BIG ONE. THIS IS A CRITICAL STATE. THERE'S NO WAY TO OVERSTATE
JUST HOW IMPORTANT PENNSYLVANIA IS GOING TO BE IN NOVEMBER. AND HE'S REALLY POPULAR HERE.
AT 61% FAVORABILITY AND HE HAS REALLY BRANED HIMSELF AN AS BIPARTISAN GOVERNOR WHO CAN
BRING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER. SO HARRIS IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE A LITTLE MODERATE TO
SPEAK TO THE SWING VOTERS POTENTIALLY MODERATE REPUBLICANS OR CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS AND HE COULD HAVE LEG
UP. BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF CONTENDERS. LISTEN TO WHAT WE HEARD FROM
VOTERS TODAY. >> I DON'T THEY WE CAN GO WRONG WITH ANY. BUT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE JOSH
SHAPIRO. >> JOSH SHAPIRO OUR GOVERNOR. WE ARE PROUD OF HIM AND THINK HE BRINGS A LOT TO THE TABLE.
>> Reporter: CH STILL QUITE A LIST OF CONTENDERS AMONG THEM
ARIZONA SENATOR MARK KELLY. MINNESOTA GOVERNOR WALZ. AND ILLINOIS GOVERNOR CONDITION IT CANNY GOVERNOR, A LOT OF
GOVERNORS AND NOT A LOT OF TIME TO MAKE THE DECISION. REPORTING SAYS AUGUST 7th IS
THE DEADLINE FOR DEMOCRATS. WE COULD LEARN AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK, VALERIE. >> AND JOSH, IT LOOKS LIKE VICE
PRESIDENT HARRIS IS CLOSING THAT LEAD WITH TRUMP IN SOME NEW POLLS. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE
NUMBERS? >> Reporter: YEAH, THE RACE TIGHTENING UP.
HARRIS' FAVORABILITY GOING UP. VANCE WHO WAS THE NEW RUNNING MATE FOR FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP

LIKE REID HOFFMAN. KATE ROONEY. >>> THE FBI SAYS DONALD TRUMP AGREED TO TALK ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE MAN WHO
TRIED TO KILL HIM. THEY SAY IT'S STANDARD AND WANT TRUMP'S PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT HE OBSERVED THAT DAY.
THE FBI SAYS THAT THE POPE FOCUS IS TO NAIL DOWN THE
MOTIVES. 20-YEAR-OLD THOMAS CROOKS WHAT THEY KNOW NOW IS THAT HE USED A DRONE NEAR THE RALLY JUST HOURS
BEFORE THE SHOOTING, AND HE CONCEALED ONLINE GUN PURCHASES. AND THEN THERE WAS THIS ANTIDOTE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
DURING THE ATTACK. >> AT APPROXIMATELY 6:11 P.M., A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER WAS BOOSTED ON TO THE ROOF BY
ANOTHER OFFICER WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED THE SUBJECT. THE SUBJECT POINTED THE REICHEL AT HIM AND THE OFFICER
IMMEDIATELY DROPPED TO THE GROUND. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 25 TO 30 SECONDS AFTER THE ENCOUNTER,
THE SUBJECT FIRED 8 ROUNDS BEFORE BEING SUCCESSFULLY
NEUTRALIZED BY THE UNITED STATES SECRET SERVICE COUNTER SNIPER. >> JUSTICE REPORTER RYAN RILEY
HAS MORE ON THE INVESTIGATION. >> Reporter: THE FBI SAID ON MONDAY FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAD AGREED TO SIT DOWN
FOR A VICTIM IMPACT INTERVIEW WITH THE BUREAU ABOUT THE ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE. THE NEWS CAME AT A BRIEFING FOR
REPORTERS MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AFTER THE ATTACK A BRIEFING THE FBI OFFICIAL SAID THEY WERE
HOLDING TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY DURING THE INVESTIGATION. THE INTERVIEW WITH TRUMP WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH INTERVIEW
THE BUREAU WOULD CONDUCT FOR A VICTIM OF CRIME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FBI SAID THE INVESTIGATION
FOUND ATTEMPTED ASSASSIN THOMAS MATTHEW CROOKS WAS HIGHLY INTELLIGENCE AND LONER WITH FEW
FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES OUTSIDE OF THE FAMILY AND WHAT GROWING INTEREST IN WEAPONS.
HE CAREFULLY PLANNED THE ATTACK AHEAD OF THE CAMPAIGN RALLY AND WORKED TO KEEP PLANS QUIET.
THE MOTIVE IS NOT KNOWN BUT THE FBI REQUESTED INFORMATION ABOUT THE ONLINE ACCOUNTS INCLUDING
GAMING ACCOUNTS FROM DOZENS OF COMPANIES. OFFICIAL SAID CROOKS' GAMING
ACCOUNTS BACKED LACKED ACTIVITYTIVITY AND SOCIAL CONTACTS WERE GATED.
ESEEKED INFORMATION ABOUT THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF PRIME MINISTER AND MASS SHOEING AND POWER PLANTS. LAST WEEK THE FBI REVEALED HE

SECONDS AFTER A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER ATTEMPTED TO CONFRONT HIM ON THE ROOF.

EXPLAINING THE DECISION TO ENTER THE REELECTION BID AT THE LIBRARY OF THE LAST SITTING PRESIDENT TO DO THE SAME.
HE TOOK ON TWO HOT TOPICS,
SUPREME COURT REFORM, AND PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. >> I HAVE RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTIONS SEPARATION OF POWERS LAID OUT IN THE
CONSTITUTION. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THAT DOCTRINE.
OF SEPARATION OF POWERSP USE THE COMMISSION ANALYSIS AND TODAY I AM CALLING FOR BOLD
REFORMS TO TRUST AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE COURT AND DEMOCRACY. >> NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT AARON GET CYST JOINS US. WALK US THROUGH THE PROPOSALS. WHAT IS HE SUGGESTED AND WHY. >> Reporter: WELL, I THINK YOU
PLAYED WHY. PRESIDENT SAYS THE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO STRENGTHEN THE GUARDRAILS OF THE DEMOCRACY.
HE BELIEVES PROPOSAL HE OUTLINED TODAY WOULD HELP TO DO THAT. THERE ARE THREE POINTS TO THE PRESIDENT'S POSE POSAL HE LAID
OUT HERE AT THE LYNDEN JONSON PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY IN AUSTIN AS THEY CELEBRATED THE 60th
ANNIVERSARY OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TERM LIMITS FOR
MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT. HE RECOMMENDED AN 18-YEAR TERM FOR MEMBERS OF THE COURT SAYING THAT A PRESIDENT WOULD LIKELY
GET TO A POINT TWO OR NOMINATE TWO PEOPLE TO THE SUPREME COURT THROUGH THE COURSE OF A PRESIDENCY.
AND THAT IT WOULD -- THAT TERM WOULD REDUCE THE CHANCE OF ONE PRESIDENT RADICALLY ALTERING
THE COURT FOR GENERATIONS. THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE BINDING
ENFORCEABLE CODE OF ETHICS FOR MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT, SOMETHING THAT IS MORE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SEE OTHER FEDERAL
JUDGES HAVING TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW AS IT RELATES TO GIFTS AND POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. AND THE PRESIDENT ALSO TALKED
ABOUT WANTING TO SEE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT WOULD ENSURE FORMER PRESIDENT
DON'T HAVE IMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO POTENTIAL FEDERAL PROSECUTION FOR OFFICIAL ACTS THAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED WHILE
THE PRESIDENTS WERE IN OFFICE. THAT'S SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT QUITE A BIT SINCE THE SUPREME COURT MADE
ITS RULING ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY IN THE CASE OF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. AND SO THESE ARE THINGS
PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYS HE BELIEVES WOULD HELP TO FIRM UP PUBLIC TRUST IN THE SUPREME
COURT. AND IN THE PRESIDENCY AS WELL, VALERIE. >> AARON, THESE ARE PRETTY BIG
PROPOSALS. WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD ANY OF THIS WOULD PASS? >> Reporter: YEAH, THIS WOULD
BE A VERY HEAVY LIFT, AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAY. SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE --
WOULD REQUIRE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. I WILL SPARE YOU THE CIVICS LESSON BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO
GET A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ALL COMPLEX WHICH IS BY DESIGN I WOULD IMAGINE. THERE WAS ONE OF THE
PRESIDENT'S PROPOSALS, THE IDEA OF CREATING MORE ENFORCEABLE CODE OF ETHICS IS SOMETHING THE
LEGISLATURE COULD DO JUST BY PASSING A LAW, BUT IT IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, WE DO
HAVE A LEGISLATURE THAT IS DIVIDED. AND WE HAVE GOT REPUBLICANS CONTROL THE HOUSE AND DEMOCRATS IN CONTROL OF THE SENATE AND SO
GETTING SOMETHING LIKE THAT PASSED THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE
REPUBLICANS, SAID THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS DEAD ON ARRIVAL. PUTTING OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT HE WOULD NOT SUPPORT THIS.
OBVIOUSLY, AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN WOULD NOT GET THROUGH CONGRESS. >> WE NOTE PRESIDENT HAS A COUPLE OF MONTHS LEFT IN
OFFICE. DO YOU THINK THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST OF A FEW BIG PROPOSALS WE
MIGHT BE SEEING FROM HIM? >> Reporter: YOU KNOW, THAT'S A POSSIBILITY. YOU ARE RIGHT. THERE'S ABOUT SIX MONTHS OR
LESS THAN THAT FOR THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT HAS ELEVATED. YOU MENTIONED, THIS IS THE
FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE PRESIDENT IN THE PUBLIC PLACE SINCE HE DECIDED TO END HIS BID
FOR REELECTION. AND THIS WAS THE ISSUE THAT HE CHOSE TO ELEVATE IN THAT MOMENT. AND SO I THINK THIS IS
SOMETHING YOU CAN EXPECT TO HEAR HIM TALKING ABOUT MORE AND MOREOVER THE MONTH TO COME. AS I SAID, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT IS LIKELY TO GET THROUGH CONGRESS IN THE TIME THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS LEFT IN OFFICE. BUT, POTENTIALLY, THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE A TALKING POINT FOR DEMOCRATS. AND FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT. SHE ENDORSE THE PLAN AND WE ARE
TOLD BY THE WHITE HOUSE SHE WAS CONSULTED AS THE PRESIDENT CAME UP WITH THE PLAN. POTENTIALLY, IT'S SOMETHING WE
COULD SEE COME UP THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN SEASON, AND POTENTIALLY SOMETHING THAT A
PRESIDENT HARRIS COULD TALK ABOUT IF SHE WERE TO WIN IN
NOVEMBER, VALERIE. >> THE PRESIDENT IS ON HIS WAY TO HOUSTON WHERE PEOPLE ARE PAYING RESPECTS TO REPRESENTATIVE SHEILA LEE
JACKSON WHO RECENTLY PASSED AWAY. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT EVENT? >> Reporter: PRESIDENT BIDEN
CALLED THE CONGRESSWOMAN A FORCE. HE SAYS SHE WAS A TOWERING FIGURE IN POLITICS WHO SPOKE TRUTH TO POWER AND HE IS GOING
TO HOUSTON TO PAY HIS RESPECTS, REALLY. THE FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN IS LYING IN STATE AT THE CITY HALL
IN HOUSTON. AND PRESIDENT BIDEN MADE IT A POINT TO ADD A STOP TO HIS TRIP HERE SO HE COULD GO THERE AND
PAY RESPECTS ALONG WITH SEVERAL MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WILL BE HERE IN TEXAS.
SHE WILL GO TO HOUSTON ON THURSDAY AND DELIVER A EULOGY AT THE CLOSED FUNERAL SERVICE

>> WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THE RESULT ANNOUNCED DOES NOT REFLECT THE WILL OR THE
VOTES OF THE VENEZUELA PEOPLE. INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS WATCHING CLOSELY. AND WILL RESPOND ACCORDINGLY.
>> LET'S BRING IN CORRESPONDENT DAVID NORIEGA WITH THE LATEST. DAVID, MADURA'S OPPONENTS WANT
TO CHALLENGE THE RESULTS. BUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW? >> Reporter: WELL, THE BIG
QUESTION NOW IS WILL THE GOVERNMENT ALLOW ACCESS TO THE PAPER TALLY THE OFFICIAL PAPER
TALLY PRODUCED BY VOTING MACHINES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO FAR THEY ARE REFUSING ACCESS
AND CLAIMING MADURRA WON BY 51% TO GONZALEZ 44%. OPPOSITION SAYS IT HAS GOTTEN
ITS HANDS ON ENOUGH OF THE PAPER TALLIES TO BE ABLE TO
PROVE STATISTICALLY GONZALEZ WON ABOUT 70% OF THE VOTE WINNING IN A LANDSLIDE. THIS SITUATION CAN'T CONTINUE
IN THIS WAY. SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE. THE BIG QUESTION OF WHAT WILL GIVE WHETHER THE OPPOSITION WILL GIVE OR THE GOVERNMENT OF
MADURRA WILL LIVE DEPENDS ON HOW BIG THE PROTESTS WE ARE STARTING TO SEE BECOME.
HOW MUCH PRESSURE MADURRA COMES UNDER FROM INTERNATIONAL ACTORS. PARTICULARLY COUNTRIES IN THE
REGION LIKE COLOMBIA AND BRAZIL WITH GOVERNMENTS NOT ALLIES WITH MADURRA BUT FRIENDLY DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS COULD PUT
PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT. WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT FRACTURES AND MILITARY STAYS BEHIND MADURRA THESE ARE THE
QUESTIONS MOVING FORWARD, PARTICULARLY HOW BIG AND HOW VIOLENT PROTESTS YOU SAW HOW
THOSE EVOLVE MOVING FORWARD. >> WE HAVE BEEN SEEING THE IMAGES OF PROTESTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
WE SAW SOME THERE.
GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW AND THE GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL WILL THE PROTESTS HAVE AN IMPACT. >> Reporter: LOOK, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED IN
VENEZUELA IN RECENT YEARS. THERE'S OTHER DISPUTED ELECTS AND WAVES OF PROTESTS, BUT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT THE
OPPOSITION HAS COALESCEED AROUND A SINGLE CANDIDATE. AND ACTUALLY ACTIVELY AND FULLY
PARTICIPATED IN ELECTION RATHER THAN BOYCOTTING THEM. THE REGION INCLUDING UNITED STATES, IS FACING THE
CONSEQUENCES OF A MASSIVE OUTMIGRATION FROM VENEZUELA ONE OF THE BIGGEST MASS MIGRATION
IN RECENT HISTORY, AND WE HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE PROTESTS ARE HAPPENING IN WHAT USED TO BE
SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN LARGELY POOR AND WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS. IF THAT CONTINUES MOVING. >> THAT DIRECTION, THEN IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT ENOUGH THINGS CHANGED JUST IN TERMS OF THE CONDITIONS THAT WE ARE SEEING ON THE GROUND FOR THIS TO
ACTUALLY PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE ON MADURRA TO LET GO OF POWER SOMETHING HE REFUSED TO DO FOR MANY YEARS. NOW, LAST THING I WILL SAY IS
MADURRA IS UNDER INDICTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING AND CORRUPTION.
A LOT OF PEOPLE OBSERVERS EXPERTS PEOPLE IN VENEZUELA THINK IT'S UNLIKELY HE WILL
LEAVE POWER PEACEFULLY BEING THE KEY WORD UNLESS THERE'S SOME KIND OF DEAL THAT ALLOWS HIM TO ENSURE HE WON'T JUST
WIND UP IN AN AMERICAN PRISON. VALERIE. >> TALK TO US ABOUT WHY THE WORLD SHOULD BE PAYING
ATTENTION TO THIS, AND NOT JUST THE SURROUNDING COUNTRIES, BUT HERE IN THE U.S. AS WELL.
>> Reporter: WELL, THE MAIN REASON IS MIGRANT CRISIS I MENTIONED. 7.7 IS KIND OF THE LATEST
NUMBER MILLION VENEZUELANS LEFT IN THE TIME SINCE MADURRA HAS BEEN IN POWER.
20% OF THE POPULATION. THE VAST MAJORDAN IS IN LATIN AMERICA BUT 10% HAVE CROSSED
THE SOUTHERN BORDER INTO THE UNITED STATES IN THE LAST FIVE
YEARS. THE VENEZUELAN ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS BECOME A HEMISPHERIC CRISIS. FOR ALL OF THE AMERICAS.
THAT IS ONLY ONE BUT PROBABILITY TOP REASON WHY WE SHOULD ALL BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS AND WHY WE SHOULD CARE.
>> OKAY. DAVID NORIEGA THANKS FOR THAT REPORTING. >>> NOW TO PARIS AS WE CHECK IN
Team USA opening weekend medal count
WITH HOW THE U.S. IS DOING SO FAR AT THE OLYMPICS. OVER THE WEEKEND, AMERICANS WON A TOTAL OF 12 MEDALS INCLUDING
GOLD MEDALS FOR BOTH SWIMMING
AND FENCING. AND AFTER A RAINY OPENING CEREMONY THEY ARE RAISING REGULAR FLAGS OVER THE WATER
CALL THE OF RIVER SEINE. KEIR SIMMONS TELLS US MORE.
>> Reporter: ANOTHER EVENTFUL DAY HERE IN PARIS WHERE THE MAN'S TEAM USA GYMNASTICS TEAM
ACHIEVING A BRONZE MEDAL THE FIRST MEDAL SINCE 2008 AND CHINA AND JAPAN GETTING GOLD
AND SILVER. BUT CELEBRATIONS WERE OFF THE CHARTS BOTH SPECTATORS AND TEAM
USA THEMSELVES AND CAMARADERIE WAS AMAZING CELEBRATING THAT GOLD MEDAL AFTER SO MUCH ATTENTION ON THE WOMEN'S
GYMNASTICS CORRECTLY SO, WITH SIMONE BILES PUTTING IN AN INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE THIS WEEK. A LITTLE GLORY FOR THE MEN.
MOWN WHILE DJOKOVIC BEATING NADAL. MOVING SECOND ROUND. HE IS HOPING THAT HE WILL ADD A GOOD MEDAL TO HIS NUMBER OF
GRAND SLAMS, SO, THAT STORY IS DEVELOPING WELL HERE.
MORE CONCERNS THOUGH AND THIS IS FOR PARIS OVER WHETHER OR
NOT THE TRIATHLON WILL BE ABLE TO HAPPEN. THE PLAN WAS THEY WOULD SWIM IN THE SEINE AS PART OF THE
THIGHING
TRIATHLON AND OR EVENTS. THERE WAS TOO MUCH IN THE WATER.
THEY WILL MAKE DECISION IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING. THEY COULD STILL DELAY IT, AND
HOLD IT. THEY BELIEVE THE WEATHER WILL ALLOW THEM TO SEE THOSE E.COLI LEVELS LOW ENOUGH FOR THE
SWIMMING TO TAKE PLACE. BUT IT'S A BIT OF A WORRY. IT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CITY
IS A VEN CREW. IT'S SPECTACULAR AND CHALLENGING. >> THANK YOU. >>> STILL AHEAD THIS HOUR,
POTENTIAL GAME CHANGER IN COLON CANS ARE DETECTION. DETAILS ON TESTS THAT COULD LEAD TO MORE PEOPLE BEING
DIAGNOSED. WEFOLKS UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WILL HAD TO JUMP IN THE OCEAN. >> NEWS FOR GENERATION OF NOW
IS NBC NEWS NOW. >>> MANY OF SOME OF THE STORIES. A 72-YEAR-OLD WOMAN AND TWO 4 YEAR SOLD BOYS DEAD AND TWO
MORE INJURED AFTER PONTOON BOAT CAP SIGHED IN ARIZONA. IT WAS BEING TOWED WHEN IT OVERTURNED FRIDAY.
THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED. >>> MANDATORY EVACUATIONS HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR A WILD FIRE
WEST OF LOVELAND, COLORADO. OFFICIALS ARE CALLING IT THE ALEXANDER MOUNTAIN FIRE. AND THEY SAY IT'S BURNING UP TO
247 ACRES AND COUNTING PARTLY IN THE ROOSEVELT NATIONAL FOREST. >>> SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH

WAVES ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, COVID ACCOUNTS FOR 2% OF DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA UP
FDA approves new blood test to screen colon cancer
SLIGHTLY FROM THE WEEK BEFORE. >>> NOW TO A POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH IN THE FIGHT
AGAINST COLON CANCER. THE FOOD AND DRUGS ADMINISTRATION APPROVED A BLOOD TEST. COAL OP OR RECTAL CANS ARE
AFFECT OVER 150,000 AMERICANS EACH YEAR AND IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER CONNECTS IN THE COUNTRY.
IT'S ALSO BEEN AFFECTING YOUNGER PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF
50. AN AT GROWING RATES. HERE'S MEDICAL FELLOW. THIS TEST IS NOT NEW RIGHT? IT WAS AVAILABLE TO DOCTORS, AS
A SCREENING TOOL SO DOES THI
FDA APPROVAL ENSURE SAFETY. >> THAT'S GREAT QUESTION. GOOD EVENING. THE TEST NOW THAT TODAY GOT FDA
APPROVAL, WHAT IT TELLS DOCTORS AROUND THE COUNTRY IS SORT OF SEAL OF APPROVAL THE TEST YOU
KNOW, DID MEET THE HIGH BAR FOR SCREENING. IT WAS AVAILABLE BEFORE BUT DON'T KNOW TOO MANY PEOPLE
USING BECAUSE IT WAS EXPENSIVE AND BECAUSE WE WEREN'T SURE HOW EXACTLY TO USE THIS.
WITH TODAY'S APPROVAL, THE OTHER THING IS IMPORTANT IS INSURANCE COVERAGE. MEDICARE WILL COVER SIGNIFICANT
PORTION OF THIS. WE EXPECT COMMERCIAL INSURANCE TO DO THE SAME. SO THE F-D-A APPROVAL
SIGNIFICANT IN THIS CASE TODAY, VALERIE. >> TALK TO US ABOUT HOW THIS TEST WORKS AND HOW EFFECTIVE IS
IT SUPPOSED TO BE? >> SO THE TEST PICKS UP A LITTLE PIECES OF DNA. ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU
KNOW IF YOU HAVE COLON CANCER IT CAN SHED PIECES OF DNA FROM
THE COLON INTO THE BLOOD. SOCK AHEAD LIQUID BIOPSY AND 83% EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF
IDENTIFYING THE COLON CANCERS IN STAGE ONE TWO AND THREE. BUT SEE THE 13%.
THAT'S ABOUT EARLIER STAGE POLYPS. MOST OF US KNOW SOMEONE WITH POLYPS REMOVE IN THE
COLONOSCOPY OR TOLD THEY WERE PRECANCEROUS. THE BLOOD TEST DOESN'T PICK UP ON THOSE AS WELL. THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT
CAVEAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE STUDY AND. IF THE BLOOD TEST IS POSITIVE,
YOU HAVE TO GET A COLONOSCOPY TO CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS. >> ALL RIGHT.
YEAH, THAT'S THE NEXT QUESTION. WE HEARD PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT GETTING A COLONOSCOPY.
DOES IT MEAN THE DAYS ARE COMING TO AN END. >> UNFORTUNATELY, NOT.
YOU KNOW, COLONOSCOPY IS THE GOLD STANDARD BECAUSE IT PICKS
UP POLYPS 95% COMPARED TO THE 13%. SO I THINK FOR ALL THOSE OUT
THERE WHO AVOID IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS LIVE SAVING. COAL OP CANCER PREVENTABLE
DISEASE TO EXTENT. I URGE YOU TO GET SCREENED IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY. >> WITH THAT IMPORTANT REPORT,
THANK YOU SO MUCH. IN ANY TOO MANY. >> BEFORE WE GO TIME FOR THE FUTURE OF EVERYTHING. ELON MUSK UNDER FIRE TONIGHT
WHY? THAT'S THE FUTURE OF A.I. AND POLITICS. HOW HE MAY HAVE VIOLATED THE POLICIES OF HIS OWN SOCIAL
MEDIA PLATFORM. >>> PLUS WE HEAD BACK TO PARIS. GADI SCHWARTZ IS TAKING A STAB
AT ART OF FENCING. HOW SHARP ARE HIS SKILLS? YOU WILL HAVE TO STAY AND HOPE. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND EACH
Elon Musks retweets altered Harris campaign ad
OTHER. >>> CLAR CLEAR. >>> ELON MUSK IS UNDER FIRE TONIGHT AFTER SHARING A FAKE CAMPAIGN AD OF KAMALA HARRIS ON
X. THE AD HAS AN A.I. GENERATED VOICEOVER SOUNDS LIKE HARRIS IS CALLING BIDEN SEE
NILE AND HERSELF AN INCOMPETENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. THE VIDEO DOESN'T STOP THERE EITHER. MUSK ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP FOR
PRESIDENT AND CLEAR FIED ONLINE THE VIDEO WAS SATIRE BUT
NEITHER X OR MUSK RESPONDED TO NBC NEWS REQUEST FOR COMMENT. LET'S BREAK IT DOWN.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE VIDEO WHERE IT CAME FROM AND WHAT IS X'S
POLICY ABOUT SHARING CONTENT LIKE THIS? >> Reporter: YOU TALKED ABOUT IT RIGHT. WHAT WAS IN THE VIDEO. IT WAS A.I.
GENERATED AS YOU MENTIONED. THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN THIS KIND OF
QUOTE, UNQUOTE CAMPAIGN VIDEO A DEEP FAKE SAYING PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WAS SEE NILE CALLING HER
SEA OF DEI HIRE. THE ORIGIN OF THIS VIDEO IS FROM YOUTUBE. IT WAS ACTUALLY ON YOUTUBE AND
PUT AS PARODY VIDEO PUT UP BY AN ACCOUNT CALLED MR. REAGAN.
THEN ELON MUSK RETWEETED THAT VIDEO ON X. AND DID NOT IN FACT CLASSIFY IT AS A PARODY.
DESPITE THE FACT IT WAS ORIGINALLY CLASSIFIED AS A PARODY. NOW THE HUGE PROBLEM IS DESPITE
THE FACT WE LOOK AT X VERSUS WHAT TWITTER ONCE WAS AND
OFTENTIMES A LOT OF MISINFORMATION, THIS ACTUALLY RETWEET MAY HAVE VIOLATED X'S
POLICY. LET ME READ QUOTE, UNQUOTE WHAT THE POLICY SAYS. AND YOU CAN DECIDE FOR
YOURSELF. YOU MAY NOT SHOW SYNTHETIC MANIPULATE OR OUT OF CONTEXT MEDIA RECEIVE DECEIVE OR
CONFUSE PEOPLE AND LEAD TO HARM. MISLEADING MEDIA. IN ADDITION WE MAY LABEL POST
CONTAINING MISLEADING MEDIA TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND AUTHENTICITY AND PROVIDE
ADDITIONAL CONTEXT. ELON MUSK'S, YOU KNOW, HIS DEFENSE HERE IS SAYING THAT PARODY IS NOT A CRIME. THAT'S WHY HE SAYS HE WAS ABLE
TO KIND OF RETWEET THE INITIAL DEEP FAKE. KAMALA HARRIS' CAMPAIGN PUTTING OUT A STATEMENT AS WELL SAYING
WE ELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT THE REAL FREEDOM, OPPORTUNITY AND SECURITY VICE PRESIDENT IS OFFERING.
NOT THE FAKE MANIPULATED LIES OF ELON MUSK AND DONALD TRUMP. AND REMIND FOLKS AS MANY PEOPLE
KNOW, AT THIS POINT, WHEN THE INITIAL ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION HAPPENED AS THE FORMER
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DIRECTLY AFTER THAT ELON MUSK IN FACT ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES VALERIE. >> WE KNOW VIDEOS LIKE THIS THERE'S MORE OF THEM OUT THERE. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE LAST ONE WE SEE. >> Reporter: YEAH. >> IN REGARDS TO THE ELECTION.
CONCERNS ABOUT MISINFORMATION AND HOW IT SPREADS HAS BEEN A BIG ISSUE FOR YEARS. EVEN BEFORE THE SORT OF A.I. BOOM THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE
OF. WHAT WORRIES DO INCIDENTS LIKE THIS RAISE ABOUT WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA? >> Reporter: IT IS INTERESTING
THIS IS HAPPENING NOW BECAUSE A COUPLE HOURS AGO, NEWS BROKE FROM THE FTC ON WHAT THEY PLAN
TO DO PROPOSING AND I WANT TO READ IT SO I GET IT RIGHT FIRST
OF ITS KIND MANDATE DISCLOSURE OF A.I. GENERATED CONTENT IN POLITICAL
ADS. THOUGH IT MAY NOT GO INTO EFFECT IN TIME ESSENTIALLY BEFORE THE ELECTION, AND YOU
REMEMBER, VALERIE, A COUPLE MONTH AGOS ARE THERE WAS THE DEEP FAKE A.I. GENERATED ROBO CALL OF
PRESIDENT BIDEN DURING THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY PRESIDENT BIDEN BY THE WAY A DEEP FAKE
AND I CAN'T RESTATE THIS ENOUGH SAYING DON'T TURN OUT TO VET FOR THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. AND THAT WAS ALSO A.I.
GENERATED. BUT DATING BACK TO BEFORE A.I. EVEN CAME TO FRUITION. THINK ABOUT THE TESTIMONY FROM
MARK ZUCKERBERG AND MISINFORMATION ABOUT FACEBOOK AND 2020 ELECTION AND 2016 ELECTION. AS WELL, THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD
SURROUNDING ISIS AND THE HATE SPEECH THAT WAS PUT OUT FROM TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS LIKE ISIS IS AND WHETHER OR NOT
TWITTER SHOULD ALLOW PROVE GRANDA FROM ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THAT FROM A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION LIKE ISIS. IT'S AN ONGOING CONVERSATION
AND THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR IT. BUT AS TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE SOPHISTICATED, AND THEY BEGIN
TO USE IT MORE IN POLITICAL ADS, AS WE SEE NOW, AND NOT
IDENTIFYING DEEP FAKES IS WHEN IT IS PROBLEM MATIC ESPECIALLY WHEN THE DAY IN AGE WE HAVE
SITUATION IN THE 2020 ELECTION THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAYING THE ELECT WAS STOLEN WHEN IT WAS
NOT TRUE, VALERIE. >> I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT UP UNTIL NOVEMBER.
