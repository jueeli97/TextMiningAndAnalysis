TO RUN FOR THE NOMINATION.
HARRIS HAS BEEN GAINED
ENDORSEMENTS NOT JUST FOR THE
CONVENTION, BUT MOST OF BIG
NAMES IN HER PARTY, INCLUDING
AS WE MENTIONED, THE BIGGEST
NAMES BARACK AND MICHELLE
OBAMA.
JOINING ME NOW IS A LONGTIME
LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
ONE OF THOSE NAMES, JIM
CLYBURN.
CONGRESSMAN, I WANT TO START ON
JUST THIS WEEK THAT VICE
PRESIDENT HARRIS HAS HAD.
YOU OBVIOUSLY ALREADY ENDORSED
HER, BUT BEFORE THE PRESIDENT
WITHDREW, YOU SAID IT WERE TO
HAPPEN, THE PARTIES SHOULD NOT
TRY TO WORK AGAINST HER.
ARE YOU SURPRISED AT ALL THAT
NO ONE IN THE PARTY HAS WORKED
AGAINST HER, AND THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY HAS COALESCED SO QUICKLY
AROUND HER?
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
HAVING ME.
I AM JUST SLIGHTLY SURPRISED.
BUT I THINK MOST OF THE
DELEGATES ARE PRETTY MUCH IN
TOUCH WITH THE HISTORY OF OUR
PARTY.
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
AROUND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR
A LONG TIME.
THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.
IF YOU HAVE WIDE OPEN
CONVENTION AS WE HAVE HAD
BEFORE WHAT HAPPENED IN 1968,
1972, 1980, ALL OF THOSE WIDE-
OPEN CONVENTIONS RESULTED IN
DRAMATIC LOSSES, RICHARD NIXON,
THAT WAS 68, AND 72.
THERE WAS ONE STATE AFTER 1972.
SO, WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO
COME TOGETHER QUICKLY,
COALESCED BEHIND A NOMINEE. AND
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ARE
GOING TO DO WITH THE VICE
PRESIDENT.
THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN IN
OFFICE NOW FOR 3 YEARS, 3.5
YEARS.
AND BEFORE THAT, SHE WAS IN THE
SENATE.
BEFORE THAT, SHE WAS ATTORNEY
GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA.
BEFORE THAT, A PROSECUTING DA.
SHE HAS A TREMENDOUS RESUME,
ONE THAT LENDS ITSELF WELL TO
BEING ABLE TO MANAGE THE
BUSINESS OF THIS COUNTRY
FAMOUSLY.
AND SHE WILL DO THAT.
I THINK THIS COUNTRY IS GOING
TO ELECT HER.
>> THE LAST THREE YEARS OF THE
RESUME, HER TIME AS VICE
PRESIDENT, DOES THAT WORK FOR
HER OR AGAINST HER?
I KNOW YOU ARE PROUD OF THE
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RECORD.
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO TRY TO
HANG ELEMENTS OF IT AROUND HER
NECK GOING FORWARD.
>> I HOPE THEY WILL.
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO LOOK AT THE RECORD OF
THE BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION
AND COMPARE THAT TO THE
PROPOSALS COMING FORTH FROM THE
OTHER SIDE IN THEIR PROJECT
2025.
I HAVE BEEN SAYING TO PEOPLE
ALL OVER, WHATEVER YOUR
INTEREST IS, SOCIAL SECURITY,
MEDICARE, EDUCATION, CIVIC
SERVICE, WHATEVER IT IS, LOOK UP
PROJECT 2025, THEN GO TO THAT
SECTION OF THE 900 PAGES AND
SEE WHAT THEY ARE PROPOSING FOR
YOUR INTEREST.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN DOING AWAY
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL
SERVICE? EMPLOYMENT IN THIS
COUNTRY, TURNING THAT OVER TO
ONE PERSON, SO YOU DO THEIR
BIDDING, RATHER THAN THE
BIDDING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
SOUNDS LIKE WOODROW WILSON TO
ME.
THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT TO
HAVE IN OUR GOVERNMENT.
>> CONGRESSMAN, I'M CURIOUS
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE HARRIS
CAMPAIGN IN THE VIDEO THEY
DEBUTED.
YOU CAN HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF
THE CHANGE IN TONE, THE NUANCE
OF LANGUAGE HERE.
THE VICE PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT
FREEDOM, DEFENDING PERSONAL
FREEDOM.
THE SHIFT FROM THE WAY THE
PRESIDENT SPOKE ABOUT DEFENDING
DEMOCRACY.
AS THAT IS THE CHANGE THAT
MATTERS?
DO YOU THINK AMERICANS ARE MORE
LIKELY TO BE DIALED INTO
CONCERNS ON THEIR FREEDOMS MORE
THAN THE ABSTRACT CONCEPT OF
DEFENDING DEMOCRACY?
>> THAT TAKES US BACK TO THE
KIND OF BASIC LANGUAGE THAT WE
STARTED USING A LONG, LONG TIME
AGO, THE FREEDOM TO VOTE, THE
FREEDOM TO CHOOSE, THE FREEDOM
TO GO UP AT YOUR BUSINESS.
THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT.
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WORD,
FREEDOM.
YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE TRYING TO
DEFINE WHAT DEMOCRACY REALLY
MEANS.
THEY UNDERSTAND INDIVIDUAL
FREEDOMS.
AND THAT IS A GOOD WAY TO
RELATE TO PEOPLE.
>> YOU TOLD USA TODAY EARLIER
THIS WEEK, QUOTE, WE THOUGHT WE
WERE READY FOR THAT, MEANING, A
WOMAN TO BE PRESIDENT IN 2016,
AND WE WEREN'T READY FOR THAT.
I WONDER AS WE SIT HERE IN
2024, IS THE COUNTRY READY NOW?
>> I CERTAINLY HOPE SO, AS A
FATHER OF THREE DAUGHTERS, I
WORK EVERY DAY TRYING TO MAKE
SURE I MAKE THIS A BETTER PLACE
FOR THEM TO GROW UP IN.
NOW, THOSE DAUGHTERS OF MINE
ARE ALREADY GROWN.
I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF
GRANDCHILDREN, AND A GREAT
GRANDCHILD.
I HAVE GOT TWO GRANDDAUGHTERS
AND ONE GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER.
I WANT THEM TO HAVE A COUNTRY
TO GROW IN MUCH, MUCH DIFFERENT
FROM THE ONE I GREW UP IN.
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU, AS SOME
WOMAN WITH TWO DAUGHTERS
MYSELF, I AM DIALED IN, TOO.
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE
STAKES HERE.
THEY ARE VETTING SOME FOLKS.
YOU HAVE NAME CHECK TO THE
GOVERNORS, SHAPIRO, COPPER,
WALTZ, AS WELL AS SECRETARY DUE
TO JUDGE.
THAT'S ABOUT HALF THE LIST WE
HAVE HERE RIGHT NOW.
SO, I WONDER WHAT YOU MAKE OF
THE LIST, AND WHO YOU THINK
COMPLEMENTS HER THE BEST.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST
MENTIONED IMPORTANT DATA AS IT
RELATES TO THE MIDWEST.
I THINK WALTZ IS GREAT FOR
THAT.
IF YOU LOOK AT IT UNIVERSALLY,
LOOK AT FOREIGN SERVICE.
DUE TO JUDGE IS GREAT FOR THAT.
LAST TIME I CHECKED, I THINK HE
SPEAKS SEVEN OR EIGHT DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE.
HE IS A TREMENDOUS CABINET
SECRETARY.
HE HAS DEVELOPED A RELATIONSHIP
WITH GOVERNORS ON BOTH SIDES OF
THE AISLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
HE WOULD DO GREAT THERE.
JOSH SHAPIRO, I LIKE VERY MUCH.
I KNOW HIM VERY WELL.
I KNOW THAT WALTZ BRINGS A LOT
TO THE TABLE.
ANOTHER FROM THE MILITARY SIDE,
BUT WALTZ WAS THE HIGHEST
RANKING -- WHAT DO THEY CALL IT?
THE NATIONAL GUARDS,
NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER IN THE
COUNTRY.
HE HAS A TREMENDOUS BACKGROUND
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MILITARY.
HE IS FROM WHAT YOU CALL THE
MIDWEST.
HE WOULD DO IT.
SHE HAS GOT A GREAT LINEUP FOR
HER TEARS.
>> YOU ARE PUTTING MORE NAMES
ON THE LIST, NOT TAKING THEM
OFF.
WE ARE WORKING BACKWARDS HERE.
LET ME ASK THE QUESTION THIS
WAY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE THE
MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN HOW
SHE MAKES THIS DECISION?
>> CHEMISTRY.
CHEMISTRY.
>> PERSONAL CHEMISTRY?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WHO -- IS HE COMPARABLE
ALONGSIDE OF?
THE VIBES THAT COME FROM THAT,
THAT IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.
WE ALREADY SEE THE OTHER SIDE
HAVING PROBLEMS WITH CHEMISTRY.
THERE IS BAD CHEMISTRY BETWEEN
TRUMP AND J.D.
VANCE.
IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE.
>> AS YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS
RACE, AS YOU ARE PEERING ACROSS
THE BORDER INTO NORTH CAROLINA,
DO YOU THINK HAVING KAMALA
HARRIS AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET
CHANGES THE MAP AT ALL?
WE TALK ABOUT THE POLLING.
YOU ARE A SOUTHERNER.
SHE POLLING BETTER THAN
PRESIDENT BIDEN DID?
>> IN BOTH OF THOSE, I THINK
SO.
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE HE
ENERGIZES THE YOUNG VOTERS IN
-- MUCH MORE THAN BIDEN DID HERE
HE WAS WINNING THEM, SINGLE
DIGITS.
SHE NOW SEEMS TO BE WINNING
THEM BY DOUBLE DIGITS.
IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO LEAD BY
DOUBLE DIGITS.
