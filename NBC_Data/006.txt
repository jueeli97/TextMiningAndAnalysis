>>> THE GLOVES ARE OFF. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP ATTACKS
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS AS A RADICAL LEFT LUNATIC. AS THE DE FACTO DEMOCRATIC
NOMINEE TRIES TO FRAME THE RACE AGAINST TRUMP AS A BATTLE OVER
FREEMAN -- FREEDOM.
PLUS, NEW INSIGHT INTO WHAT KEY
VOTERS ARE THINKING AFTER A TRULY UNPRECEDENTED SERIES OF EVENTS. AN ISRAELI POWER MINISTER --
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS EXPECTED TO MEET WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS MINUTES FROM NOW AFTER MEETING WITH RESIDENT BIDEN AND
FAMILIES OF HOSTAGES STILL BEING HELD BY HAMAS.
>>> WELCOME TO MEET THE PRESS NOW. ONE PAST TORCH, TWO NEW
CANDIDATES, THAT IS THE STATE OF PLAY IN AN UNPRECEDENTED
2024 CAMPAIGN THAT NOW HAS 103 DAYS TO GO UNTIL ELECTION DAY. AS PRESIDENT BIDEN LAYS OUT HIS
VISION FOR HIS REMAINDER IN THE OFFICE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS SHARPENS THEIR ATTACK AGAINST
EACH OTHER. LAST NIGHT THE PRESIDENT MADE A SOLEMN OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS.
THE PRESIDENT LEANED INTO WHAT HAD BEEN A MAJOR THEME OF HIS
CAMPAIGN, ALSO HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR YOUNG VOICES IN
CHARGE. IF NOTHING CAN COME IN THE WAY OF SAVING OUR DEMOCRACY AND THAT INCLUDES PERSONAL AMBITION. I HAVE DECIDED THE BEST WAY
FORWARD IS TO PASS THE TORCH TO A NEW GENERATION.
IT IS THE BEST WAY TO UNITE OUR NATION. IF IT COMES AS HIS CHOSEN SUCCESSOR VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS APPEARS TO BE LEAVING -- LEANING IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
MESSAGE. TODAY HER CAMPAIGN IS OUT WITH HIS FIRST VIDEO WARNING OF
THREATS TO FREEDOM. BACKED BY A BEYONCE TRACK.
SPEAKING OF THE TEACHERS UNION, THE VICE RESIDENT TESTING OUT THE NEW MESSAGE. >> IN THIS MOMENT WE ARE IN A
FIGHT FOR OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS. TO THIS ROOM OF LEADERS I SAY
BRING IT ON.[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> WE WHO BELIEVE IN
THE FREEDOM TO VOTE WILL PASS THE JOHN THE WAS VOTING RIGHTS
ADVANCEMENT ACT. WE WILL BELIEVE IN THE FREEDOM TO LIVE SAFE FROM GUN VIOLENCE.
>> TYING HER TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S RECORD AND PAINTING HER AS MORE EXTREME THAN HIS FORMER OPPONENT.
>> FOR 3 1/2 YEARS LYING KAMALA HARRIS HAS BEEN THE ULTRALIBERAL DRIVING FORCE BEHIND EVERY SINGLE BODY
CATASTROPHE. SHE IS A RADICAL LEFT LUNATIC WHO WILL DESTROY OUR COUNTRY.
THEY SAY SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I GOT SHOT. I BECAME NICE.
WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH THESE PEOPLE, THEY ARE VERY DANGEROUS PEOPLE. WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH THEM YOU CANNOT BE TOO NICE, YOU
REALLY CAN BE. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'M NOT GOING TO BE NICE. SHE IS WORSE THAN HIM.
HE IS A LIBERAL. HE WAS IN THAT LIBERAL. HE WAS FAKE. SHE IS A REAL LIBERAL. SHE IS MUCH WORSE THAN HIM.
>> JOINED ME NOW ONSET,
FOLLOWING THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN, THE LATEST ON ALL THINGS WITH
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN.
WE MENTIONED THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN INTRODUCING THIS FREEDOM VIDEO. IS THIS A TOTAL OVERHAUL OF THE BY THE METHODS OF PROTECTING DEMOCRACY OR IS THIS THE SAME
CONCEPT IN NEW CLOTHING? >> I THINK THIS IS PRESIDENT
BIDEN MESSAGE WITH BEYONCE ADDED TO IT. THIS IS A MODERNIZATION AND A FRESH LOOK AT WHAT HE HAS ALREADY BEEN TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHICH IS THEY
BELIEVE DONALD TRUMP IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. I WAS LOOKING AT WHAT SHE SAID. I THINK IT BEARS REPEATING.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT US TO BE A COUNTRY OF CHAOS, OF FEAR,
OF HATE, BUT WE CHOOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT. WE CHOOSE FREEDOM. SHE TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE IS GUN VIOLENCE, ABORTION
AND HEALTHCARE. IT IS NOT JUST ELECTION INTEGRITY AND ELECTION FRAUD, SHE SANG A WORKING DEMOCRACY
MEANS PEOPLE HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR BODY AND THEIR LIVES. THAT ALSO MEANS A REAL BITE AT THE AMERICAN DREAM. I THINK THIS IS HER REALLY
TRYING TO LEAN IN ON THE MESSAGE AND ALSO BRINGING PEOPLE IN AND MAKING IT MODERN.
>> FREEDOM TO SING YOUR KIDS TO SCHOOL WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT THEM GETTING SHOT IS AN IMPORTANT FREEDOM. IT SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY WARM
RECEPTION. HOW IMPORTANT IS UNION SUPPORT GOING TO BE FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT? IT WAS SUCH A CORNERSTONE OF THE BIDEN COALITION.
>> THINK ABOUT WHAT POSITION SHE IS IN. SHE HAS TO MAKE UP FOR LOST GROUND AND GET THE COALITION
TOGETHER. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY TO WAIT. SHE'S GOING TO BE LEANING IN ON ALL SORTS OF GROUPS. SHE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT
UNIONS, SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR BUILDING THE MIDDLE CLASS OF AMERICA. SHE SAYS WHEN UNIONS ARE GREAT, AMERICA IS GREAT. SHE TALKED ABOUT TEACHERS.
SHE SAID REPUBLICANS WANT TO BAN BOOKS. WE WANT TO BAN ASSAULT RIFLES. TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THESE UNIONS ARE THE HEART OF
CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES. I THINK UNIONS MAY BE IMPORTANT, BUT YOU ARE ALSO GOING TO SEE HER IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA, NEXT WEEK TALKING TO
AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS, AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN IN PARTICULAR. THOSE ARE OTHER COALITIONS THERE HAVE TO -- WILL HAVE TO
PULL THIS HOME IF THEY WANT TO
WIN. >> SHE MADE THE POINT TO TALK UP PRESIDENT BIDEN AS SHE STEPS MORE INTO THE SPOTLIGHT. DO YOU THINK THAT IS A CHANGE OVER TIME, ESPECIALLY IF THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO TRY TO USE TYING HER AND BITING TOGETHER AS A NEGATIVE AGAINST
HER? >> I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE AND HERE IS WHY. SHE IS VICE PRESIDENT BECAUSE
PRESIDENT BIDEN CHOSE HER. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IN TALKING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO HER, SHE HAS A REAR RESPECT FOR HIM. A REAR RESPECT FOR THE HARP POSITION THAT HE WAS IN IN THIS
UNPRECEDENTED MOVE. IT WAS NOT ON ANY OF OUR BINGO CARDS, SO SHE'S BEEN TALKING TO
PEOPLE. IT FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE SHE WANTS TO BE PART OF HIS LEGACY AND WANTS PEOPLE TO KNOW THIS WAS ABOUT HIS DECISION.
SHE WAS UNDERMINING HIM. IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS SHE WASN'T SPEAKING TO PEOPLE AND QUIETLY SAYING I HOPE HE GETS OUT. ALL MY SOURCES SAY IT'S GOING
TO BE YOUR DECISION, WHATEVER YOU DECIDE. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT.
SHE'S ALSO GOING TO SAY I LEARNED'S NOMINATION. SHE'S BEEN HOURS AND HOURS TALKING TO PEOPLE ON SUNDAY.
DELEGATES HAD TO VOTE FOR HER. SHE WILL LEANING TO THE IDEA THAT TRUMPETS I'M NOT REALLY THE NOMINEE.
HERE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT I TALKED TO THEM A SHORT I WAS OFFICIALLY THE NOMINEE.
>> DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MUCH WE ARE STILL SEEING A
PARALLEL CAMPAIGN? WOULD SHE HAVE BEEN IN ATLANTA NEXT WEEK IF SHE WAS STILL THE VICE PRESIDENT OR HAVE WE
JUMPED THE TRACKS WERE SHE IS THE NOMINEE AND SHE'S MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE SHE GOES? IS IT THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN OR
RIDING THE BIDEN TRAIN WHILE WE FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING GOING FORWARD? >> IF YOU SOMEONE IN THE HARRIS
CAMPAIGN IT SAYS @JOEBIDEN.COM.
THIS IS DEFINITELY A PLANE BEING BUILT MIDAIR. THIS IS A NEW EVENT COMING
TOGETHER. I'VE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE. THEY HAVE NO INFORMATION RIGHT NOW. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY ARE LEANING IN AND
BUILDING SOMETHING NEW. I THINK GEORGIA REALLY SHOWS. I'VE BEEN HEARING PEOPLE SAY
GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA WERE GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT GEORGIA WILL BE THERE ALREADY.
>> IS FASCINATING TO SEE THIS
HAPPENING. WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG TIME. SPEAKING OF THINGS WE'RE NOT USED TO SEEING, TAKE US INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE LAST NIGHT FOR THE BEFORE AND AFTER OF THE
PRESIDENT'S REMARKS. WE SAW THE PHOTOS OF HIS FAMILY. WE SAW THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF. WHAT WAS IT LIKE LAST NIGHT? WHAT IS IT LIKE AT THE WHITE
HOUSE TODAY? >> A LOT OF EMOTIONS. CERTAINLY THOSE RAN THE GAMUT FROM A SENSE OF SADNESS, EVEN A
BIT OF WONDERFULNESS AS ONE OFFICIAL DESCRIBED IT TO ME ABOUT THE PRESIDENT TAKING
HIMSELF OUT OF THIS RACE AND
HAVING TO EXPRESS THAT PUBLICLY. A SALINITY TO IT AS WELL. WE DO NOT TYPICALLY SEE THE
FAMILY INSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE DURING A ADDRESS. THOSE ARE USUALLY VERY OFFICIAL MOMENTS ON VERY MAJOR NATIONAL
EVENTS.
THIS IS A MAJOR EVENT BUT INFUSED WITH THE PERSONAL. FOR THE FAMILY IF I GLIMPSES OF HOW THIS WAS A PAINFUL TIME. WHEN THE PRESIDENT FINISHED HIS REMARKS, STEPPING INTO THE ROSE
GARDEN TO THE CHEERS OF HIS
STAFF MEMBERS. TO A SENSE OF CELEBRATION FOR WHAT HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED AND WHAT IS STILL TO BE DONE.
DEFINITELY A DIFFERENT KIND OF FEELING. THEY ALL KNOW THAT THESE HAVE THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY ON IT.
THAT A PRESIDENT CAN CHOOSE TO BE ONE TERM, IT IS RARE.
FOR HIM AT ONE POINT HAVING TALKED ABOUT BEING A TRANSITIONAL FIGURE AND NOT WANTING TO GET OUT OF THE RACE
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.
WE SAW THAT RESISTANCE. SUCCUMB TO THIS PLACE WHERE HE HAVE MADE THIS DECISION AND HE BELIEVES THIS IS THE RIGHT CALL. THEY TALKED ABOUT PRIDE, MANY
OF THE OFFICIALS THAT I TALK TO. PRIDE AS TO WHAT HIS DECISION MEANS, THE OPPORTUNITY IT
PRESENTS AND THE FACT THAT HE PUTS COUNTRY BEFORE HIMSELF. THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EMOTIONS.
IT IS NOT A TYPICAL DAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE PEOPLE SEE SUCH A PERSONAL SENSE OF EMOTION COMING FORWARD. WE DEFINITELY GOT A SENSE OF
THAT. NOW, PART OF IT WILL BE LAYING OUT WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR ALL OF
THE PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT. HE GAVE THEM AN END DATE AS WELL. THAT IS ALWAYS TRUE WHEN THERE
IS AN ELECTION, BUT IN THESE DAYS THEY KNOW THESE JOBS HAVE
A LIMITED SHELF LIFE. IF KAMALA HARRIS IS TO WIN, PERHAPS SOME OF THEM WILL CONTINUE ON. CHANCES ARE THEY ARE ALL NOW SEEING WHAT THE RUNWAY IS LEFT
FOR THEM TO ACCOMPLISH WORK IN VARIOUS AREAS. PLANNING FOR THESE REMAINING MONTHS AND TRYING TO MAKE THE
BEST OF IT. THEY SAID THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT WHAT SORT OF TRIPS, WHAT
SORT OF AGENDA ITEMS CAN BE PUT FORWARD. STILL A LOT TO FIGURE OUT AND
WE WILL BE FOLLOWING OVER THE DAYS TO COME. >> KELLY, HANG TIGHT. WE HAVE MORE TO TALK ABOUT. I WANT TO STAY ON THE CAMPAIGN AND BRING IN MATT DIXON.
TRUMP LAST NIGHT PRESENTED IS NO MORE MR. NICE GUY MOVE AS A SHIPS, BUT THE UNITY MESSAGE
THAT HIS CAMPAIGN TALKED UP, EVEN IF JOE BIDEN HAD STAYED IN
THE RACE DO YOU THEY WOULD END UP RIGHT BACK WHERE WE ARE WITH TRUMP IN ATTACK MODE?
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE UNPRECEDENTED NATURE OF THIS CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS VERY TRUE. WHAT IS VERY PRECEDENTED IS THE
UNITY OR RESET MESSAGE THAT
TRUMPETS WANT TO SOFTEN HIS MESSAGE. THE MEDIA AND OTHERS TAKE THE BAIT AND START WRITING OUR STORIES ABOUT UNITY. INEVITABLY ALL OF THAT GOES UP IN SMOKE VERY QUICKLY. THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF
THAT. WE ASKED ABOUT THE UNITY STUFF A LOT IN MILWAUKEE. I AND MANY OTHERS WERE IN THE
WALKIE FOR THE CONVENTION.
ASKING, HEY, ISN'T GOING TO BE A CHANGE? THE CAMPAIGN IS ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THAT THIS TIME. THE ONE QUOTE WAS IMPRESSIVE.
WE GOT A LOT OF QUOTES LIKE THAT FROM A LOT OF DELEGATES. WE DID A STORY AND THERE WERE A BUNCH OF THEM. THE IDEA THAT UNITY IS UNIFYING BEHIND TRUMPET NOT NECESSARILY
BIPARTISAN, BRINGING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. I THINK THAT IS WHAT UNITY MEANS FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND A
LOT OF REPUBLICANS AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING. >> I'M CURIOUS, IT SEEMED TO ME WATCHING THE RALLY THAT DONALD
TRUMP SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO RECYCLE SOME OF HIS ATTACKS ON JOE BIDEN EYE TINE KAMALA HARRIS TO HIS RECORD.
IS THAT TRUMP CAN'T LET BIDEN GO? IS THERE REAL STRATEGIC VALUE IN CONTINUING TO HAMMER JOE BIDEN AND SORT OF BRINGING KAMALA HARRIS ALONG FOR THE
RIDE? >> I THINK THAT THE STRATEGIC VALUE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. THE BIG ONE, IT WAS WORKING.
I THINK THEY FELT JOE BIDEN WAS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO WIN. HE WAS DOING POORLY IN NATIONAL AND SWING STATE POLLING.
SOME OF THE ATTACK LINES ON JOE BIDEN WERE PROVING TO BE VERY
EFFECTIVE. A NEW CANDIDATE WITH MUCH MORE ENERGY, GETTING A BIG FUNDRAISING AND MESSAGING BOOTH OUT OF THE GATE.
I THINK THERE IS STILL SOME SENSE ON THE TRUMP SITE THAT SOME OF THE SAME MESSAGING WORK. I DO THINK THEY ARE STARTING TO SORT OF TEST DRIVE A NEW LINE
ABOUT HOW JOE BIDEN ACTED LIKE A CALIFORNIA LIBERAL AND KAMALA
HARRIS IS A CALIFORNIA LIBERAL. I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO START TO EVOLVE SOME OF THAT TO FOCUS
MORE ON HARRIS. I THINK WITHOUT QUESTION SOME OF THE BODY MESSAGING WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE CYCLE IS GOING TO REMAIN. SHE WAS A COPILOT IN THE VP
BRAWL OF IT. >> MATT, THANK YOU FOR THAT. I WANT TO TURN BACK TO THE
WHITE HOUSE. AFTER DELIVERING FIERY AND DEFIANT SPEECH TO CONGRESS YESTERDAY, IT'S REALLY MINISTER
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS AT THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW.
HE IS MEETING SEPARATELY WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND IN VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS. WHILE THOSE MEETINGS ARE GOING
ON INSIDE PROTESTERS ARE GATHERED OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY. THAT FOLLOWS THE MASSIVE DEMONSTRATIONS SEEN AROUND CAPITOL HILL YESTERDAY WITH
MANY PROTESTERS CALLING NETANYAHU A WAR CRIMINAL. THOSE PROTESTS ESCALATED WITH DEMONSTRATORS IN BURNING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THE WORDS
HAMAS IS COMING GRAFFITIED ON THE MEMORIAL OUTSIDE UNION NATION. IT IS AGAINST THE BACKDROP THAT
BIDEN AND NETANYAHU MET IN THE OVAL OFFICE TODAY WHERE THEY TOUTED THEIR DECADE-LONG
RELATIONSHIP. THE TWO WERE ALSO MEETING JOINTLY WITH FAMILIES OF THE AMERICAN HOSTAGES BEING HELD IN GAZA. THAT MEETING WRAPPING UP
MOMENTS AGO. LATER THIS HOUR NETANYAHU IS SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS BEFORE FLYING DOWN TO MAR-A-LAGO TO MEET WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP
TOMORROW. WE WILL BRING BACK IN KELLY
O'DONNELL TO TALK ABOUT ALL OF THESE MEETINGS. KELLY, NETANYAHU HAVE WANTED A WHITE HOUSE OVAL OFFICE MEETING FOR SOME TIME NOW.
HOW WAS HIS SPEECH ON CAPITOL HILL BEING RECEIVED BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION? IT WAS NOT WARMLY RECEIVED BY
DEMOCRATS YESTERDAY. >> THE WHITE HOUSE IS DECLINING TO TAKE IT PIECE BY PIECE AND PARCEL OF THE STATEMENT MADE IN FRONT OF CONGRESS. WHICH OF COURSE DID HAVE SOME
FIERY RHETORIC FROM NETANYAHU. THEY DO SAY THERE ARE SHARED GOALS CERTAINLY AND THEY
BELIEVE THIS CAN BE A
MEANINGFUL MEETING. WHEN YOU POINT OUT WANTING A WHITE HOUSE MEETING, THEY HAD MET AT THE UNITED NATIONS WHEN
THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WAS HELD, OF COURSE.
HAVING AN OVAL OFFICE MEETING IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST FORMS OF DIPLOMACY. NO QUESTION THERE HAVE BEEN
MANY PHONE CALLS AND VIDEOCONFERENCES BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT, SOME OF THEM INCLUDING VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS
AND NETANYAHU OVER RECENT MONTHS, CONSIDERING ALL THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE WAR
THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY.
WHAT THE PRESIDENT DID NOT DO IS USE THAT TIME IN THE OVAL OFFICE TO SAY MUCH PUBLICLY, SAYING THEY WOULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL MEETING TO COME. SORT OF OPENING THE FLOOR TO BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WHO USE THAT
MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT HIS LONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT AND THE FACT THAT JOE BIDEN, THROUGH THE MANY YEARS, HAS
KNOWN EVERY ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER GOING BACK TO GO TO MY
YEAR -- SO KIND OF A MOMENT TO PAY RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC SERVANT OF JOE BIDEN. NOT SO MUCH AS A PUBLIC
DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES BEFORE
THEM. >> IS MEETING KIND OF UNUSUAL. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE TONE OF
THAT TO BE LIKE? IS THERE A GOOD COP-BACKUP ELEMENT? >> THESE SORTS OF MEETINGS ARE NOT THAT UNUSUAL THEY JUST TYPICALLY HAVE NOT GOTTEN THAT
MUCH ATTENTION. WHEN A HEAD OF STATE OR HEAD OF GOVERNMENT, IS OFTEN THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE A MEETING AND THE VICE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE A SEPARATE MEETING.
AT THIS CASE BECAUSE SHE WAS TRAVELING TODAY AT HER EVEN EARLIER, SHE IS COMING BACK. THEY ARE HAVING IT SEPARATE. THAT IS PART OF -- IT WITH
ACTUALLY AN INTERESTING THING. MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT REALIZE THOSE MEETINGS HAPPEN AND THEY JUST DON'T TYPICALLY GET
ATTENTION WHEN A VICE PRESIDENT IS DOING IT. SHE IS NOW A VICE PRESIDENT WHO IS THE CANDIDATE. IT HAS TAKEN ON A MUCH GREATER
SIGNIFICANCE. SHE THREW HER TIME AS VICE
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN THE TIP OF THE SPEAR AT TIMES WHEN SHE HAS TALKED ABOUT CONCERN FOR A CEASE-FIRE, USING LANGUAGE THAT SOME PEOPLE INTERPRETED AS BEING A BIT FURTHER AHEAD OF
PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THE TIME. THAT MAKES WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU VERY IMPORTANT. PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING FOR THE
TOLL THAT SHE USES. OFFICIALS SAY THERE IS NO DAYLIGHT BETWEEN THEIR POSITIONS. SOMETIMES IT REALLY IS ABOUT A
DIFFERENT PERSONALITY BEING INVOLVED. A DIFFERENT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE DECADES OF BACK STORY THAT BIDEN AND NETANYAHU HAVE.
THAT IS PART OF WHAT WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR AS THIS UNFOLDS. >> WILL GET A PEEK IN TO THAT
MEETING LATER. THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORTING. AS WE FOLLOW DEVELOPING NEWS FROM INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE, WE
ARE HOPING TO BRING YOU AN INTERVIEW WITH THE HOSTAGE FAMILY MEMBERS AS SOON AS THEY LEAVE THAT CLOSED-DOOR MEETING.
BUT FIRST, THE NEWEST
INSTALLMENT OF OUR FOCUS GROUP SERIES WITH KEY 2024 VOTERS AND WHAT A REVAMPED DEMOCRATIC TICKET CUT ME, SPECIFIC FOR
VOTERS WHO BACKED NIKKI HALEY. THATTHE NOW. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW
IS NBC NEWS NOW . >>> WELCOME BACK.
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS'S CAMPAIGN HAS CLEARLY ENERGIZED DEMOCRATS, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE VOTERS OUTSIDE OF THE PARTY'S BASE? SPECIFICALLY THE VOTERS SKEPTICAL OF FORMER PRESIDENT
TRUMP. THEY ARE THE VOTERS WHO COULD DECIDE A CLOSE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. OUR LATEST FOCUS GROUP, WE
TALKED TO SOME OF THESE VOTERS.
THIS IS A GROUP OF REPUBLICANS WHO BACKED NIKKI HALEY IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. WE SPOKE WITH HIM TWO DAYS AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN STEPPED
ASIDE AND ENDORSED HARRIS. HERE IS SOME OF WHAT THEY SAID WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE NEW DE FACTO DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. >> VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS?
FIRST WORD OR PHRASE THAT COMES TO MIND? EVERYONE HAVE ONE? BARBARA, PLEASE GO FIRST.
>> INTERESTING. >> JENNIFER. >> CONDESCENDING.
>> RONNIE? >> RADICAL.
>> MELODY? >> I WANT TO SAY INTELLIGENT. >> INTELLIGENT IS THE WORD?
GOT IT. HAD TO MAKE SURE.
SARAH? >> I WOULD SAY A FEMINIST. >> SOMETIMES CATTY.
>> ASIA? >> GIGGLY.
>> CHRIS? >> COATTAILS.
>> JOHN? >> LIBERAL. >> JASON? >> WORD SALAD.
>> AMONG THE SEVEN OF YOU, HOW MANY OF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF AN OPINION ABOUT
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS TO RENDER AN OPINION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER? NEARLY ALL OF YOU.
>> ALL RIGHT, MARK MURRAY JOINS
ME NOW. THIS IS FASCINATING STUFF. WHAT DO THOSE ANSWERS TELL YOU
ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS'S OPPORTUNITY TO WIN OVER SOME OF THESE VOTERS SHE MIGHT VERY WELL NEED? >> SOME OF THEM ARE POSITIVE
FOR HARRIS. THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO WE FOUND OUT LATER VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN IN 2020 AND WERE PROBABLY GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM IN 2024. THEY HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN
THE CRADDICK IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. SOME OF THOSE DESCRIPTIONS WERE ABSOLUTELY HARSH. THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO TEND TO BE
LEAVING TRUMPS WAY ARE VOTING THIRD PARTY. I'M REALLY GLAD IF -- THAT YOU
PLAYED THE CLIP. THE QUESTION IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DISLIKE ABOUT HARRIS?
ONE RESPONDED THAT I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HER. THAT IS WHAT PROMPTED THE QUESTION WHO WANTS TO HEAR
MORE? EVERYONE RAISE THEIR HAND. THAT IS OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE. CAN SHE ACTUALLY DESCRIBE TWO PEOPLE WHO SHE IS, YOU KNOW, WE
ARE GOING TO PROBABLY START HEARING THAT FROM THE CONVENTION. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME BETWEEN NOW AND NOVEMBER.
>> INTRODUCING YOURSELF TO PEOPLE SEEMS EASIER THAN HAVING TO CHANGE THAT SET OF OPINIONS.
I SUPPOSE THAT IS A PROBLEM YOU CAN WELCOME IF YOU ARE THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN. AGE WAS SUCH A BIG ISSUE IN THE
OLD MATCHUP. I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THESE HALEY VOTERS SAID NOW THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN
IS OUT OF THE RACE. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AGE ISSUE. NOW THAT BIDEN IS OUT OF THE
RACE IS IT PERSUASIVE FOR DEMOCRATS TO ARGUE THAT TRUMP AT THE AGE OF 78 WOULD BE THE
OLDEST PERSON EVER INAUGURATED IF HE WON?
THAT HIS AGE IS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN AND THAT IT WAS TIME FOR A NEW GENERATION OF LEADERS TO TAKE OVER. WHO THINKS THIS IS A PERSUASIVE
ARGUMENT? >> AND I PUT UP HALF OF A
FINGER? COMPONENTS I AGREE WITH AND OTHERS ARE LIKE HOGWASH. >> WHAT PART DO YOU AGREE WITH?
>> I AGREE IT IS TIME FOR NEW AND YOUNGER LEADERSHIP. >> THEY WERE BOTH TOO OLD IN THE FIRST PLACE.
WE DO NEED A NEW GENERATION OF
POLITICAL LEADERS.
>> I LOOK BACK IN THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT FROM 10 YEARS AGO. I CANNOT IMAGINE THE WORLD THEY THINK THEY KNOW, BUT HAVE BEEN
SEPARATED FROM FOR SO LONG. JUST THE TOPICS AND ALL OF THE ISSUES ARE SO MUCH DIFFERENT
AND THEY HAVE TO BE HANDLED SO MUCH DIFFERENTLY. THEY ARE SO USED TO A POLITICAL
PHILOSOPHY THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE WITH TIME. >> WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT
THAT IS TO HAVE NEW GENERATIONAL LEADERSHIP SO CENTRAL TO NIKKI HALEY'S MESSAGE. IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE BIDEN'S
PRESENCE INOCULATED DONALD TRUMP AGAINST THAT ATTACK. >> FOR ME THE TAKE AWAY IS HOW LITTLE HAS ACTUALLY CHANGED. THIS FOCUS GROUP CAME NOT ONLY
AFTER HARRIS IS NOW THE DE FACTO NOMINEE, AFTER JOE BIDEN'S EXIT, BUT ALSO AFTER THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
AFTER AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT. AFTER THAT FIRST DEBATE.
WERE YOUR MIND KIND OF CHANGE GOING INTO THIS? WERE YOU BODYBUILDERS? HAVE YOU CHANGED AND NOW YOU ARE SOMEONE ELSE?
TO ME VOTING PREFERENCE HASN'T CHANGED ALL THAT MUCH. TAKING AWAY THE AGE SITUATION
IS A GOOD MESSAGING FOR THE CAMPAIGN AND THE CANDIDATE. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SEEMS TO
HAVE CHANGED VOTERS MINDS ALL THAT MUCH. >> HAVING COVERED THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN FOR SO LONG IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THEY THINK THEY NEED
THESE VOTERS. THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE ACTIVELY PURSUING THEM. WHO DO YOU THINK DOES NEED THESE KINDS OF VOTERS IN THEIR COALITION? >> MORE OF THESE VOTERS ARE TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN VOTERS.
YOU NORMALLY WOULD SAY TRUMP PROBABLY NEED SOME MORE. IN OUR POLARIZED TIMES WHEN THE POLLS SHOW A VERY CLOSE RACE EVERY VOTERS SEGMENT DOES MATTER. WHAT ALSO STUCK OUT TO ME WAS
THESE PHOTOS REALLY LIKED NIKKI
HALEY. THEY WERE LOYAL ABOUT HER AND
THAT WAS REALLY STRIKING. >> KAMALA HARRIS STILL NEEDS TO PICK A VICE PRESIDENTIAL
RUNNING MATE. >> THEY WOULD WANT NIKKI HALEY TO BE HER PICK. >> THANK YOU FOR THAT. UP NEXT, FROM THE HEADLINES TO
THE SIDELINES, HOW THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS LOOKING TO REGAIN THE SPOTLIGHT AFTER A WILD WEEK OF DEVELOPMENT AND MOMENTUM FOR
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS AND THE DEMOCRATS. MY INTERVIEW WITH A SENIOR ADVISER TO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS NEXT. YOU ARE WATCHING MEET THE PRES
>>> SHE IS THE MOST RADICAL PERSON PROBABLY THAT WE HAVE HAD IN OFFICE, LET ALONE THE
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY. SHE WAS A HORRIBLE CAMPAIGNER. SHE RAN AGAINST BIDEN. I THOUGHT HE WAS TERRIBLE, SHE
WAS HORRIBLE. SHE WAS THE MEANEST PERSON UP THERE. >> THAT WAS FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HITTING VICE
PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS'S MORNING. ON STAGE LAST NIGHT IN CHARLOTTE AND ON THE AIRWAVES
THIS MORNING THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAID HE'S NOT BEING NICE. WAS HE EVER? AFTER DEALING WITH WHAT HE CALLS GARBAGE FROM THE OTHER
SIDE. JOIN ME NOW IS DANIELLE ALVAREZ.
TAKE YOU FOR COMING ON. I WANT TO START BY PLAYING SOMETHING J. D. VANCE SAID AT A FUNDRAISER IN HIS FIRST APPEARANCE AS A REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. THIS WAS AFTER THE
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT. >> I CANNOT BELIEVE AN ASSASSIN
TRY TO TAKE DOWN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I WAS MAD ABOUT IT. WAS HE MAD AND ANGRY? HE CALL FOR NATIONAL UNITY. HE SHOWED LEADERSHIP, MY FRIENDS
. THE MEDIA KEEPS ON SAYING THEY WANT SOMEBODY TO TONE DOWN THE TEMPERATURE. DONALD TRUMP GOT SHOT AND HE TONED DOWN THE TEMPERATURE. THAT IS WHAT A REAL LEADER
DOES. >> LAST NIGHT WE HEARD TRUMP SAY HE'S NOT GOING TO BE NICE
ANYMORE AND CALL THE OTHER SIDE A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY THAT WILL DESTROY OUR COUNTRY. HE CAUGHT HARRISON LUNATIC.
SHOULD WE ASSUME HE IS DONE TURNING DOWN THE TEMPERATURE? >> I THINK FOLLOWING THE
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IT TOOK A LEADER LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO
UNDERSTANDS AND MEETS THE MOMENT. HE STOOD UP AND LET THE CROWD KNOW HE WAS OKAY AS THEY WERE WAITING WITH BAITED BREATH. MANY OF THEIR COLLEAGUES FOR
THEIR. WE ARE IN A PRESIDENTIAL RACE
AND THE STAKES ARE INCREDIBLY HIGH. KAMALA HARRIS IS DANGEROUSLY
LIVABLE. WE NEED TO CALL BALLS AND STRIKES LIKE WE SEE THEM. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CALL HER ON HER RECORD. SHE IS THE ORIGINAL BORDER
CZAR. SHE WAS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT HAVE CAUSED CHAOS ON THE WORLD STAGE,
DISASTER AFTER DISASTER. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE BE HONEST ABOUT THAT RECORD AND SAY IT CLEARLY. IT IS WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL BE DECIDING ON.
>> RECORD IS ONE THING, I THINK LUNATIC IS ANOTHER. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THESE
DIFFERENT ATTACKS WE HAVE STARTED TO SEE FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY. BOTH ARE TRYING TO DEFINE KAMALA HARRIS. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, HAVE THEY
DECIDED WHICH ROUTE YOU WANT TO
GO DOWN? I HAVE A HARD TIME COMBINING THE MESSAGES. ON THE ONE HAND TRUMP CALLS HER INCOMPETENT AND OF THE OTHER HE IMPLIES SHE IS THE PERSON
BEHIND THE STEERING -- SEEMS PULLING ALL THE STRINGS. >> BOTH CAN ABSOLUTELY BE TRUE.
SHE IS INCOMPETENT IN THE POLICIES THAT SHE HAS SUPPORTED. LET'S REMEMBER SHE WAS THE DECIDING VOTE ON THE $1.9 TRILLION SPENDING PACKAGE IN
THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT ROCKETED US INTO INFLATION. SHE IS BOTH INCOMPETENT AND HAS
FAILED IN HER LEADERSHIP. SHE IS ABSOLUTELY MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. SHE IS A FAILED BORDER CZAR.
SHE WAS IN HOUSTON TODAY 300 MILES FROM THE BORDER AND HAS NOT GONE TO SEE THE DEVASTATION AND THE MATH THAT HER FAILURE HAS RESULTED IN.
WITH THE FENTANYL POURING IN, WITH THE MIGRANT CRIME RISING. THAT IS SQUARELY ON THE TERRACE- BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND ON
KAMALA HARRIS WAS THE ORIGINAL BORDER CZAR . >> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE
TRUMP CAMPAIGN'S PLAN FOR THE BORDER. AS YOU KNOW WE SAW SIGNS LAST
NIGHT THIS THAT DEPORT ILLEGALS NOW.
DONALD TRUMP IS THAT HE WILL IS UP TO THE LARGEST DEPORTATION EFFORT IN U.S. HISTORY, BUT HASN'T GIVEN A LOT OF DETAILS. I AM CURIOUS WHAT ELSE YOU CAN TELL ME ABOUT THAT PLAN?
WHAT WILL IT COST? WILL HE SEEK TO DEPORT EVERY SINGLE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES? >> IT IS A KEY FACTOR IN HIS
PLATFORM. AGENDA-47. IT IS ONE OF THE KEY POINTS.
IT IS BROADLY SUPPORTED BY EVERY AMERICAN, INCLUDING HISPANIC AMERICANS. THE REALITY IS WE CANNOT SUSTAIN THESE 10 MILLION+ ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS OF THE
BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION. IT IS A FAILURE. >> DANIELLE, PASSING A PLATFORM IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN IN LAW. WHAT I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD IS ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD
ACTUALLY WORK? >> AS WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A RECORD OF SUCCESS AND ACCOMPLISHING THINGS WHEN THE WASHINGTON, D.C. ELITES SAY IT
CANNOT BE ACCOMPLISHED. HE WAS THAT HE WILL SECURE THE BORDER. HE HAS SAID HE WILL DEPORT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND THOSE
WHO HAVE CROSSED UNDER THE BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION. YOU CAN DEFINITELY TAKE THAT TO
THE BANK. IT IS A PRIORITY OF HIS AND HIS ADMINISTRATION. HE HAS RUN ON THE BORDER SINCE
2015. IT IS AN ISSUE TOP OF MIND FOR AMERICAN VOTERS. YOU KNOW IN IN THE FOCUS GROUPS
IT IS THE NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER
TWO ISSUE. THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF BOTH OF THOSE AS HIS RECORD HAS SHOWN PREVIOUSLY.
>> I DON'T DISPUTE, BUT IS NOT
QUITE CLEAR WHAT I'M TAKING TO THE BANK OTHER THAN A CONCEPT. WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW YOUR CAMPAIGN WANTS TO DEFINE THE VICE PRESIDENT.
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW SHE IS TRYING TO DEFINE HERSELF AS WE GET INTO THIS 100 A SPRINT. LISTEN TO THIS.
>> I WAS ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL AND I WAS A COURTROOM PROSECUTOR BEFORE THEN.
IN THOSE ROLES I TOOK ALL PERPETRATORS OF ALL KINDS. PREDATORS WHO ABUSE WOMEN,
FRAUDSTERS WHO RIPPED OFF
CONSUMERS. CHEATERS WHO BROKE THE RULES FOR THEIR OWN GAIN. HEAR ME WHEN I SAY, I KNOW
DONALD TRUMP'S TYPE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]>> SO
DOES SHE? WHAT IS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN RESPONSE? >> LANA HARRIS IS CHAOTIC ON
CRIME AT BEST. WE KNOW THAT SHE WAS VERY HARSH FOR MINOR CRIMES, ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATED TO THE BLACK
COMMUNITY. SHE WENT FOR THE HARSHEST SENTENCES AND IMPRISONED BLACK MAN. THEN SHE WAS VERY SOFT ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.
WE KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE WITH THE FAMILY WHERE SHE WILL NOT PROSECUTE THE MS-13 GANG MEMBER
WHO REALLY MURDERED TWO MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY. SHE NEVER PURSUED CHARGES AND
NEVER WENT HARSHLY AGAINST ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. IT GOES BACK TO HER BEING
CHAOTIC ON CRIME, SOFT ON CRIME WHEN SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AND TOO HARSH IN OTHER
INSTANCES. IT GOES BACK TO BEING VERY WEAK ON THE BORDER. THIS IS THE ONE WHO IN 2020
CAMPAIGN ON ABOLISHING ICE, WANTED TO DECRIMINALIZE BORDER CROSSING. WE KNOW THE TOP ISSUE FOR VOTERS, ONE OF THE TOP TWO AT
LEAST, SHE IS VERY WEAK ARM. >> A RECORD ON CRIME SO INCONSISTENT THE DONALD TRUMP WROTE A CHECK TO HER CAMPAIGN AFTER THAT TIME AS TO --
DISTRICT ATTORNEY. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON. AFTER THE BREAK TRUMP
AFFILIATED GROUPS ARE NOW SPENDING 24 TIMES AS MUCH MONEY ON T.V. AND RADIO ADS ON T.V.
RIGHT NOW. THE MESSAGE, THE STRATEGY AND THE PANEL ALL NEXT.
>>> WELCOME BACK. WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS'S CAMPAIGN REALLY GETTING OFF THE GROUND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN FINDS
ITSELF IN A RARE POSITION DOMINATING THE TELEVISION AIRWAYS. ACCORDING TO DATA REPUBLICAN
GROUPS HAVE SPENT NEARLY $63 MILLION ON T.V. AND RADIO ADS THE END OF
AUGUST. COMPARE THAT TO MORE THAN $2 MILLION ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. OF COURSE THIS DATA CAN AND WILL CHANGE AT ANY TIME AS
DEMOCRATIC GROUPS ARE LIKELY TO START SPENDING MONEY ON THEIR NEW CANDIDATE.
THIS AD BATTLE COULD PROVE PIVOTAL. JOIN ME NOW IF THE PANEL.
YOU ONE CAMPAIGN -- HAVE RUN CAMPAIGNS, TALK TO ME ABOUT
THIS BATTLE TO DEFINE KAMALA HARRIS. NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT KIND OF COMMODITY THEY ARE DEALING WITH. >> SHE GOT THE GREAT
OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE HERSELF TO PEOPLE.
I THINK YOU COULD SEE HER EITHER AS OBAMA 2.0.
OBAMA BUILT THIS HUGE COALITION OF YOUNG PEOPLE. HILLARY 2.0 IN WHICH YOU HAD
THE FIGHT UPHILL. DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU SEE THAT I THINK I SEE IT A LITTLE
CLOSER TO HILLARY'S POINT OF HAVING TO FIGHT UPHILL. YOU ARE LOOKING FROM BEHIND AND
SAYING I WANT TO TALK TO WORKING-CLASS VOTERS. I WANT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO THEM WITH CERTAIN KEY MESSAGES THAT WILL MAKE THEM FEEL PERSUADED ABOUT JOINING THE
TICKET. >> YOU HURT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN TRYING TO DEFINE KAMALA HARRIS AS TO SOFT ON CRIME AND TOO HARD ON CRIME. THEY TALK ABOUT THE BORDER.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS SCATTERSHOT APPROACH THAT YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR? >> I THINK THEY ARE ALL OVER
THE PLACE. THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON ONE ISSUE AND DRIVE THAT AND DESCRIBED HER THAT WAY. I THINK SOFT ON CRIME IS THE BEST WAY.
SUBURBAN WOMEN, THEY WANT TO SEE SOMETHING THAT REALLY
CONCERNS THEM. >> WE SAY SOMETHING ABOUT A
HONEYMOON PERIOD. SHE HAS TO NAME A VICE PRESIDENTIAL RUNNING MATE. IF YOU ARE THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THE
SPOTLIGHT AND DO WHAT DONALD TRUMP DID FOR REPUBLICAN RYAN
-- PRIMARY RIVALS? >> THERE IS THIS HUGE
DISCREPANCY IN AD BUYS.
THAT WAS INEVITABLE AS SOON AS BIDEN PULLED OUT THERE WERE GOING TO BE MAJOR LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING
RIGHT NOW. THESE T.V. ADS THAT BECOME UBIQUITOUS, THAT STUFF IS HELPFUL. AT THE SAME TIME WE SAW IT VERY
MUCH NOT HELP PRESIDENT BIDEN IN THE MONTHS BEFORE HE DROPPED OUT WHEN HIS TEAM FIRED OFF THE
MONEY FIREHOSE AND DID NOT HAVE
THE DELIVERY. >> BIG-MONEY SPENDING AND BIG-
MONEY RACES OF PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW THE CANDIDATES IS LESS
EFFECTIVE. WE ARE HEARING JOSH SHAPIRO AND GRETCHEN WHITMORE WILL BE CAMPAIGNING ON KAMALA HARRIS'S BEHALF. PUT YOUR VP CANDIDATE OUT
THERE. EFFECTIVE? >> FIRST OF ALL YOU NEED AN ARMY OF PEOPLE TO HELP YOU GET YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS ANYWAY.
IT IS GREAT TO HAVE PEOPLE. I WOULD EXPAND THAT EVEN
BROADER. I WOULD URGE THE MALL TO GET OUT THERE AND SAY HEY, THIS IS WHY SHE IS GREAT.
ON THE FRAME OF WHO SHE IS SHE
IS A PROSECUTOR AND I THINK WHO COMPLEMENTS THAT IS WHO ACCENTUATES THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE A GREAT NAME, BUT I DO THINK IT
DEPENDS ON HOW YOU THINK ABOUT WHO HELPS THEM TO DO THAT. >> ON THAT END IS THIS AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR KAMALA HARRIS TO DEFINE HERSELF AS A PERSONNEL CHOICE?
HAVE -- THIS WILL BE THE LENS IN WHICH PEOPLE LOOK AT HER.
CAN SHE USE THEM TO HELP START TELLING THE STORY OF WHO SHE WANTS TO BE? >> ABSOLUTELY. THEY ARE LOOKING TO HER TO DO JUST THAT. SUBURBAN WOMEN AGAIN IS WHAT
MAIN STREET FOCUSES ON. THEY LOVE THE GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA. THEY REALLY LIKE THE SENATOR
FROM ARIZONA. THEY LIKE MARK KELLY. THEY LIKE HIS NAME I.D. THEY LIKE THE FACT THAT HE IS
AN ASTRONAUT. THEY DESCRIBED THAT IS KIND OF . I'M LIKE OKAY. THE REAL THING THEY ARE EXCITED
ABOUT IS HE HAS STOOD BY HIS WIFE. WHEN SHE WAS SHOT HE BECAME HER
VOICE. HE HAS TAKEN CARE OF HER FOR OVER A DECADE. I WAS A BETWEEN THE TWO PROBABLY MARKETS THEIR FIRST
CHOICE. >> WHAT DO THEY THINK ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF TWO WOMEN? >> NO. THEY DO NOT THINK TWO WOMEN ON
A TICKET WILL WIN. NO OFFENSE, GENTLEMEN, BUT THEY DON'T THINK THE MEN WOULD VOTE FOR TWO WOMEN ON THE TICKET.
>> WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME COVERING DONALD TRUMP. WE KNOW THAT HE SOMETIMES GETS UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN HE'S NOT IN
THE SPOTLIGHT. THAT COULD BE WHAT HE DOES SOME OF THE THINGS THAT END UP BEING MOST DAMAGING TO HIM. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE WAY HIS CAMPAIGN WILL TRY TO MANAGE
WHAT COULD BE A WEEK, TWO WEEKS OR THREE WEEKS WHERE HE'S NOT THE TOP STORY? >> TOUGH AND UNCOMFORTABLE.
EVERY TIME HE APPEARS IN AN UNSCRIPTED SETTING HIS STAFFERS ARE GOING TO BE HOLDING THEIR BREATH. TRUMP IS REALLY GOOD AT SAYING THINGS THAT CAUSES ELECTORAL HARM FOR HIM ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 2006 HE WAS A VERY STRANGE ELECTION.
THE IDEA THAT REPUBLICANS CAN REPLICATE WHAT HAPPENED THAT YEAR EIGHT YEARS LATER, WILL THERE IS A LOT OF POLLING THAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS LOVE TO POINT TO AS EVIDENCE THAT THE WIND IS AT THE BACK.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY VOTERS HAVE BEHAVED SINCE 2016 IT INDICATES LOTS OF FLASHING RED LIGHTS FOR TRUMP'S TEAM AND THEIR EFFORT TO PIVOT TO THE MIDDLE COULD BE UNDERMINED BY
THE PRESIDENT AND THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S EFFORT TO GET HIMSELF BACK IN THE NEWS.
IT'S ALSO THE STRANGE IRONY OF THE FACT THAT TRUMPS CRIMINAL CASES HAVE PRETTY MUCH ALL DISSOLVED FOR THE TIME BEING.
THE WAY IT HAS ELIMINATED THE BIGGEST MICROPHONE. >> EQUITABLE AND HOW MUCH HE HAS TRIED TO GIVE IT TO THE
MIDDLE. I HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING THIS THEORY THAT A WEEK AGO THURSDAY
THE MIDDLE OF THAT SPEECH MIGHT'VE BEEN THE HIGH POINT FOR HIS CAMPAIGN. WITH THE CRIMINAL CASE IS GONE HOW DOES HE REGAIN CONTROL OF
THE NARRATIVE AND THE SPOTLIGHT? DOES HE JUST HAVE TO HANG ON FOR ANOTHER DEBATE?
>> YOU SAW THAT LAST NIGHT.
HE SAID ALL KINDS OF THINGS ABOUT HER. HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TALK ABOUT HIS OPPONENT.
IF HE DOESN'T HAVE A WAY TO TALK ABOUT HIS COMPONENT HE DOESN'T HAVE A CAMPAIGN. HE CANNOT FUNDAMENTALLY DO IT RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE ANGER,
FRUSTRATION. HOW DARE THEY FLIP THE SCRIPT ON ME. IT WAS NOT FAIR. YOU ARE LOOKING IN THE PAST.
YOU ARE NOT LOOKING AT PRESENT
AND FUTURE. >> I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE LAST WORD. I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE AGE ISSUE. NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN DONALD TRUMP IS THE OLD GUY CANDIDATE.
THOSE NIKKI HALEY VOTERS DID NOT SEEM PARTICULARLY TROUBLED BY THAT. HIS AGE STILL A ISSUE? >> IT IS NOT.
MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT BELIEVE IT OR NOT JOE BIDEN WAS THE OLD
MAN. THE AGE THING HAS REALLY CALM DOWN. NOT AN EFFECTIVE TOOL.
>> ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO THEY REPLACE IT WITH? >> THE BIGGEST ARGUMENT FROM
HARRIS'S TRUMPISM APPELLANT AND DANGEROUS PERSON.
THEY OF COURSE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE AGE ISSUE, BUT IT IS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THEM. I WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT WILL BE
THE TOP ONE OR THE TOP TWO WORDS TO BE HERE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. >> THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING IN. STILL TO COME I WILL TALK TO
PARENTS OF A MAN TAKEN HOSTAGE BY HAMAS 293 DAYS AGO ABOUT THEIR JOINT MEETING WITH
PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU AND THE PUSH TO BRING THEIR SON AND THE OTHER HOSTAGES HOME.
YOU ARE WATCHING MEET THE PRESS NOW.
>>> AS WE MENTIONED, PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU MET TODAY WITH THE
FAMILIES OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES BEING HELD BY HAMAS. ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE EIGHT AMERICANS ARE STILL BELIEVED TO BE IN GAZA, FIVE OF
WHOM ARE THOUGHT TO BE ALIVE, INCLUDING HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN, ABDUCTED BY HAMAS ON OCTOBER 7 AND HELD HOSTAGE FOR 293 DAYS.
HIS PARENTS PARTICIPATED IN THAT MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHICH JUST WRAPPED UP A
FEW MINUTES AGO. THEY HAVE BEEN GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO JOIN ME NOW. TAKE US INSIDE THE ROOM. HOW DID THE MEETING GO AND WHAT
THE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND THE PRIME MINISTER HAVE TO SAY? >> PRESIDENT BIDEN KICKED OFF THE MEETING BY TALKING ABOUT
SOME OF THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES HE HAS HAD IN HIS LIFE WITH CHALLENGES, WITH
LOSS, AND THE URGENCY OF PUTTING US OUT OF OUR AMBIGUOUS
TRAUMA. THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR LOVED ONE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING THEM HOME NOW. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU BASICALLY CONTINUED THAT THEME
AND ASSURED US HE IS DOING EVERYTHING HE CAN TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
THEN THE ROOM OPEN FOR CONVERSATION. WE ALL GOT TO SAY WHAT WE WANTED TO SAY. WE ALL IMPRESS UPON THE LEADERS
OUR GRATITUDE AND NEVER PUSH FOR THEM TO NOT STOP UNTIL WE GET ALL OF OUR LOVED ONES OUT.
NOT ONLY TO GET OUR LOVED ONES OUT, WHICH OF COURSE WAS THE FOCUS OF THE MEETING, BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMBING THE REGION.
EVERYONE BENEFITS FROM A
HOSTAGE DEAL THAT IS PART OF A CEASE-FIRE. IT WILL ENABLE THE REGION TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD
IN A MORE PEACEFUL WAY. >> DID YOU GET AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF THOSE PEACE FIRE TALKS? OFFICIALS OF TOLD US THERE HAS BEEN A FRAMEWORK AGREED TO, WE'VE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT
IMPLEMENTATION. >> WE ALSO WERE NOT PRIVY TO
DETAILS. THESE ARE VERY SENSITIVE NEGOTIATIONS AND CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE GOING ON.
SOME THINGS THAT WERE SHARED WITH US ARE THINGS THAT WE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY THINK ARE APPROPRIATE TO SHARE FORWARD.
WE ARE NOT PRIVY TO THOSE KINDS OF DETAILS. >> LET ME ASK YOU THIS WAY, ARE YOU MORE CONFIDENT LEAVING THE
MEETING THAT YOU WERE GOING INTO IT THAT A CEASE-FIRE COULD BE NEAR? >> I WANT TO SAY I AM MORE CONFIDENT FOR A FEW REASONS.
BASED ON THE URGENCY THAT WE HEARD IN THE ROOM.
THE CRIES THAT WE HEARD IN THE ROOM. THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE URGENCY OF THIS MOMENT.
IN ADDITION WHAT WE ALSO NOW KNOW TO BE TRUE, NOT
NECESSARILY FROM THE MEETING IN THE ROOM, BUT WHAT WE KNOW IN THE LAST DAY OR TWO IS GLOBAL PRESSURE IS INCREASING ON ALL SIDES IN A WAY THAT IS MORE
LIKELY TO LEAD TO A PRODUCTIVE END TO THIS SITUATION. DOMESTICALLY IN ISRAEL WE FEEL
LIKE THE LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITIES FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE
GOTTEN THE NEGOTIATIONS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY THINK THE TIME IS RIGHT.
WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE PARTIES THAT ARE REPRESENTING HAMAS. THEY BELIEVE NOW THE TIME IS
RIGHT FOR THE HAMAS SIDE AS WELL. ALL CONDITIONS SEEM TO BE COMING TOGETHER. OF COURSE AS WE HAVE SAID, WE ARE NOT GOING TO COUNT OUR
CHICKENS OR OUR HOSTAGES UNTIL
THEY ARE HOME IN OUR ARMS. >> UNDERSTANDABLE. YOU WERE ALSO IN THE MEETING THE NETANYAHU HELD WITH HOSTAGE FAMILIES EARLIER THIS WEEK.
WE HAVE REPORTING THAT WHENEVER THE AMERICAN FAMILIES PUSHED THE PRIME MINISTER'S HIS A's WILL CALL IN HIS GUESTS FROM ISRAEL WHICH WOULD BACKUP HIS INSISTENCE THAT THE MILITARY
STILL NEEDS TO GO AFTER HAMAS. I AM CURIOUS AFTER THIS MEETING IF YOU FEEL LIKE NETANYAHU IS LISTENING TO WHAT YOU AND THE
OTHER AMERICAN FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TELLING HIM? IS HE REALLY ENGAGED WITH THE
URGENCY OF WHAT YOU ARE PUSHING FOR? >> THOROUGHLY WITH WHAT WE WERE
HEARING I DO THINK AFTER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS IN THE UNITED
STATES PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU IS UNDERSTANDING THERE IS AN CONSENSUS . CERTAINLY FROM THE
UNITED STATES AND OTHER PARTIES AS WELL THAT NOW IS THE TIME. AS JOHN SAID, WE ARE HEARING ABOUT THE SUFFERING NOT JUST OF
THE 120 HOSTAGE FAMILIES, BUT ALSO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF CIVILIANS WHO ARE SUFFERING HORRIBLY. OUR ENTIRE REGION HAS A SURPLUS
OF PAIN AND AGONY. IT IS QUITE CLEAR TO EVERY
SINGLE PARTY INVOLVED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR THIS TO END.
>> I WANT TO ADD WHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS WEEK IN WASHINGTON IS PRESIDENT BIDEN WHO MADE THE BOLD ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE IS GOING TO STEP DOWN
IS FULLY COMMITTED TO BRINGING THIS PROCESS OVER THE FINISH LINE AND FOCUSING ON IT EVEN
MORE THAN HE ALREADY HAS BEEN. THE TWO CANDIDATES, VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS AND FORMER
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, ALL THREE OF THEM HAVE BEEN UNEQUIVOCALLY CLEAR THIS WEEK THAT THIS MUST END. IF THERE IS ANY PARTY AT THE NEGOTIATION TABLE WHO HAS ANY
BENEFIT IN WAITING, I BELIEVE THAT MESSAGE THIS WEEK IS THERE
IS NOT. >> I AM GLAD YOU MENTIONED THAT. THERE HAS BEEN SUGGESTION THE NETANYAHU IS TRYING TO HOLD
OUT UNTIL OUR ELECTIONS ARE OVER IN NOVEMBER IN THE HOPES THAT HE COULD GET A BETTER DEAL FROM DONALD TRUMP, IF HE WINS. DO YOU THINK THERE ARE POLITICS IN THIS MOMENT CONTRIBUTE IN TO
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A DEAL? >> WE HAVE HEARD TWICE
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING NOW IS THE TIME TO GET THIS DONE. THIS NEEDS TO BE OVER.
HE HAS BEEN UNEQUIVOCAL ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT REALLY SHUT DOWN THAT ARGUMENT. >> WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE
PROTEST THAT WE SAW ALL AROUND D.C. YESTERDAY, DURING PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU'S SPEECH
AND AFTERWARDS? HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE SPEECH THAT -- THE MESSAGE YOU WERE TRYING TO PUT OUT WITH WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IN TERMS OF LARGE- SCALE PROTESTS AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM TIME TO TIME? >> PART OF BEING IN A DEMOCRACY
IS THAT WE DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPRESS WHAT WE THINK.
I ACTUALLY THINK BEING IN A TRUE AND VIBRANT DEMOCRACY PEOPLE ARE ALLOWED TO SAY WHAT THEY FEEL AND HOW THEY
UNDERSTAND A SITUATION. I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS A VERY
COMPLICATED, COMPLEX, LAYERED CONFLICTS. NOT EVERYONE IS COMPLETELY
AWARE OF THE NUANCES INVOLVED.
I THINK THERE ARE MANY OF THESE PROTESTERS WHO DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT OF THE HOSTAGES BEING HELD, THEY REPRESENT 24
DIFFERENT NATIONS. THEY ARE MUSLIMS, THEY ARE JEWISH, CHRISTIAN, BUDDHIST,
HINDU. WE HAVE BECOME FRIENDLY WITH ONE OF THE MUSLIM-ARAB FAMILIES WHOSE LOVED ONES ARE BEING HELD
CAPTIVE ALONG WITH OURS. ONE OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS SAID
WHY IS NO ONE ADVOCATING FOR OUR FAMILY MEMBER? THERE ARE TWO OF THEM. WHY IS NO FOR OUR MUSLIM ARAB
HOSTAGES? WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE THAI BUDDHIST FAMILIES. WHY IS NO ONE ADVOCATING FOR
THEIR LOVED ONES? THERE ARE BLACK CHRISTIAN AFRICANS BEING HELD HOSTAGE. YOU DON'T HEAR THOSE PROTEST
VOICES FOR THOSE PEOPLE AND I THINK IT IS SIMPLY THAT THEY ARE NOT AWARE THAT THIS IS NOT
A MONOLITHIC GROUP OF PEOPLE BEING HELD. >> I WANT TO ADD MORE TO THAT. >> JOHN I HAVE TO CUT YOU OFF.
WE HAVE COMPLETELY RUN OUT OF TIME. BUT I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR STORY AND YOUR
FAMILY'S STORY WITH US AND I WISH YOU LUCK. WITH THAT I HAVE TO LET YOU GO. I'M BACK TOMORROW WITH MORE
MEET
