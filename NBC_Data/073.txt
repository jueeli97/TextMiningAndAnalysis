THESE FIRES ARE
INTENSIFYING.

NOW SPRAWLING ACROSS
FOUR COUNTIES.

GROWING INTO
CALIFORNIA'S SIXTH
LARGEST WILDFIRE EVER.

HISTORY ARE ALL FROM
THE LAST SIX YEARS.

CONTINUOUS CYCLE OF
THESE.

COMMUNITY.

FAMILY WAS FINALLY
SAFE.
HIS CATS SURVIVED THE
FIRST FIRE, ONLY TO
PERISH HERE.

HORRIBLE AGAIN.
