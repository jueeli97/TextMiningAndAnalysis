IMPORTANT VOTING BLOCK.

CAMPAIGN OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE

IN THIS HEATED BATTLE FOR THE
STATE AND PRESIDENCY, BUT
CAMPAIGNS NO VOTERS HERE COULD
MAKE THE DIFFERENCE.
IN MAJORITY LATINO, READING,
PENNSYLVANIA, SAMUEL AND DAVID

POLITICS.

IT'S AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE.

ABOUT THE ELECTION NOW?

OF DOMINICAN DEFENSE BEFORE
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SURVIVED

COUNTRY, POSSIBILITY SHE TAKES
IT AND REFERS?
WE DON'T KNOW.

POSSIBLY VOTING FOR EITHER ONE
OF THESE CANDIDATES?

NERVOUS.

FIVE HISPANICS WERE VOTE IN THE
FIRST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
THIS YEAR.
READING IN THOSE SO-CALLED
LATINO BELT.
CITIES AND SMALL TOWNS ONCE
DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLDS NESTLED
IN NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA.
IN THIS REGION, LATINO
COMMUNITIES MAKE UP 9% OF THE
STATE'S OVERALL POPULATION.
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE BOTH
CAMPAIGNS ARE TRYING TO EARN
YOUR?
>> DEFINITELY.

VOTES IN 2020.
THAT YEAR, MORE THAN 610,000
LATINOS WERE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE.
WHILE MR. BIDEN ONE GO READYIN

THE RIGHT SINCE 2016.
RECENT POLLING SHOWS HARRIS

VOTERS.
IN 2020, WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?
>> ITEM.

SHE IS SWITCHING TO TRUMP IN
2024.
FRUSTRATED BY THE RISING COST
OF LIVING.

OPEN TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICE.

>> BECAUSE HER BACKGROUND.
I DON'T TRUST HER.
>> Reporter: TONYA THINKS
PUTTING PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR
JOSH SHAPIRO WON THE DEMOCRATIC
TICKET WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
DOES SHE NEED JOSH SHAPIRO TO
SECURE THE WHITE HOUSE?

IN THE ELECTION WILL TEND TO
FOLLOW SOMEBODY THEY TRUST.

PUERTO RICO WHEN SHE WAS 14.
SHE WILL VOTE HARRIS IN
NOVEMBER AND THE VP VISIT
LEAVING A LASTING IMPACT.

ARE DIFFERENT NOW THAN THEY WERE
FOR MOM AND DAD.
I AM SO HAPPY WE ARE IN THIS
COUNTRY.
>> Reporter: YEAH, NEEDLESS TO
SAY COMING BACK AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED POST
THE DEBATE, YOU CAN SEE OUT
ENERGIZED THE VOTERS ARE.
WE REACHED OUT TO BOTH
CAMPAIGNS AND THEY GAVE
DIFFERENT STATEMENTS ABOUT
THEIR APPROACH TO THE LATINO
VOTE.
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON
TELLING US THE PERCENTAGE OF
HISPANIC CIVIL VOTE CAN TAKE
THE ONE STATE TO ONE SIDE OR
THE OTHER.
THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THERE ARE
SOME POTENTIAL PLANS TO SEE THE
TRUMP TICKET WILL COME TO
READING BUT NO SPECIFIC TIME
LINE ON WHEN THAT MIGHT HAVE A.
THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN TELLING US
THE ENTHUSIASM WE'RE SEEING FOR
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IN
EVERY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY IS
UNPRECEDENTED AND LATINOS ARE
SHOWING UP IN HIGH NUMBERS TO
SUPPORT HER CAMPAIGN.
