>>> I HAVE AGREED TO THE
PREVIOUSLY UPON SEPTEMBER 10th.
NOW HE APPEARS TO BE PEDALING, BUT I AGREE TO IT.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE TO SEE THE RACE ON THE DEBATE STAGE. I'M READY, SO LET'S GO. >>, HARRIS AND DONALD TRUMP ARE
TAKING A MEDICAL OR AS THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE ENTERS ITS POST-BIDEN PHASE.
THIS IS "STAY TUNED NOW." â™ª
Teachers union endorses Harris for President
>> WE CHOOSE FREEDOM.
>> SHE ALSO DELIVERED THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS TO THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS OF THE MOST POWERFUL TEACHERS UNION IN THE COUNTRY,
IN TEXAS. >> DONALD TRUMP AND HIS EXTREME ALLIES WANT TO TAKE OUR NATION
BACK TO FAILED TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMIC POLICIES-- WE ARE NOT
GOING BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. >> ALSO NBC NEWS LEARNED FORMER
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IS GETTING READY TO ENDORSE HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT SOON, GIVING HER THE LAST BIG MISSING PIECE AS SHE TAKES OVER THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY. NBC NEWS CAN CONFIRM THE CAMPAIGN HAS REQUESTED VETTING MATERIALS FROM THESE FIVE
CANDIDATES. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A FRONTRUNNER AT THE MOMENT, THAT WE CAN REPORT
JOSH SCHAPIRO OF PENNSYLVANIA IS AN "SUPERSTRONG" VP CONTENDER.
HERE'S MORE WITH YAMICHE ALCINDOR. >> Reporter: IT WAS A BUSY DAY FOR VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA
HARRIS. SHE TOLD THE TEACHERS UNION
SHE CRITICIZED REPUBLICANS THAT THE GOP WANTS TO BAN BOOKS. AND
SHE SPOKE WITH PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU AFTER THAT MEETING.
EXPECT TO EVERYONE CALLING FOR CEASE-FIRE, AND FOR EVERYONE WHO YEARNS FOR PEACE, I SEE YOU, AND I HEAR YOU. LET'S GET THE DEAL DONE, SO WE
CAN GET A CEASE-FIRE TO END THE WAR. LET'S BRING THE HOSTAGES HOME. AND LET'S PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED
RELIEF TO THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. >> Reporter: AND HER OFFICE SHE
WANTED TO CONVEY THE VIEW IT IS TIME FOR THE WAR TO END WHEN
HOSTAGES ARE RELEASED AND THE SUFFERING OF PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS ENDS, AND THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE CAN ENJOY
THEIR RIGHTS TO DIGNITY, FREEDOM, AND SELF DETERMINATION. WE NOTE PRESIDENT BIDEN, BY
LETTER, OVER 40 OFFICIALS WHO SERVED UNDER PRESIDENTS BOTH DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLIC,
ENDORSE HARRIS, WRITING IN PART, THE FABRIC OF THE NATION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY ARE AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION.
CALLING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP A GRAVE RISK TO THE COUNTRY. >>> WE ARE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON WHO MIGHT KAMALA HARRIS
MIGHT CHOOSE. WE ARE HEARING ROY COOPER, MARK KELLY, AS WELL AS JOSH
SCHAPIRO, OF PENNSYLVANIA, ARE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT THOSE NAMES, AND OF COURSE
, THE LIST CONTINUES TO EVOLVE HERE AS WE CONTINUE TO STAY CLOSE TO OUR SOURCES. AND SHE DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF
TIME TO MAKE THIS DECISION. SO, IT'S GOING TO BE COMING DOWN TO THE WEEKS.
Trump ramps up attacks on Harris
>>> MEANWHILE, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SEEMS TO BE STRUGGLING TO COME UP WITH NEW MATERIAL TO GO AFTER VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS. FOR NOW HE SETTLED ON THE CLAIM
SHE IS A LEFT-WING RADICAL. HERE HE IS THIS MORNING CALLING IN TO FOX NEWS. >> Caller: I THINK IF HE GOES SHE THEN TAKES OVER, AND SHE IS
WORSE THAN HE IS. EVERYONE BELIEVES SHE IS A SAN FRANCISCO RADICAL. SHE'S ACTUALLY, I THINK MUCH
WORSE, A MUCH WORSE CANDIDATE. >> ANSWERING, STATEMENT ON A 78-
YEAR-OLD CRIMINAL'S FOX NEWS APPEARANCE. BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE ATTACKS. TRUMP SEEMS TO WANT TO GO AFTER
HARRIS IN OTHER WAYS, TOO,
FILING CLAIM THAT THE TRANSFER OF ITEM'S $96 MILLION CAMPAIGN WAR CHEST TO HARRIS IS AGAINST THE LAW, AND HE SENT A LETTER TO ALL THE MAJOR NETWORKS
INCLUDING NBC NEWS DEMANDING AIRTIME IN LIGHT OF BIDEN'S PRIMETIME ADDRESS . LET'S BRING
IN CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY
MISTY M. FOR THIS. FOR BONA FIDE EVENTS LIKE
SPEECHES AND EVENTS WAS CREATED? >> IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE MERIT, BECAUSE WOULD FALL UNDER
THAT EXCEPTION. GIVING CANDIDATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A PLATFORM
IN AN EQUAL WAY WITH RESPECT TO THEIR CANDIDACY, SO WHEN YOU
HAVE AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT MAKING AN ADDRESS TO THE NATION, THERE IS IMPORTANT CARGO AFTER THAT. OTHERWISE IT WOULD TECHNICALLY
PRECLUDE A POLITICIAN OR A PRESIDENT IN THAT POSITION FROM
MAKING SPEECHES TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, SO IT SIMPLY WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE. IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT BIDEN'S ADDRESS WOULD FALL UNDER THAT EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE,
NOT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE TIPPED FOR TAT WITH DONALD TRUMP. >> AND HOW ABOUT THIS COMPLAINT
ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN FUNDS? DOES THAT HAVE ANY TEETH? >> THIS COULD BE A REALLY BIG
LONGSHOT. ALL THAT BEING SAID WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AN UNPRECEDENTED LEGAL SITUATION HERE, WHERE A
CANDIDATE IS BEING REPLACED BY THE VICE PRESIDENT. WHAT DONALD
TRUMP IS COMPLAINING IS
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION. THIS MONEY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
GOING TO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. WITH THE TECHNICALITIES THE COMMISSION REPLACED HIS NAME WITH HARRIS, AND SAYING SHE IS
NOT ENTITLED TO THAT MONEY, THAT IS A VIOLATION OF THE LAW.
ON THE FLIPSIDE WITH RESPECT TO THE RULES, UNTIL THERE IS A PARTY CONVENTION, THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION, THAT
PARTICULAR CANDIDATE HAS NOT NECESSARILY BECOME THE OFFICIAL CANDIDATE YET. ALSO, HARRIS IS ON THOSE FORMS
AS WELL AS THE VICE PRESIDENT.
FOR THE BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN. WHILE TRUMP IS RAISING A NOVEL ARGUMENT WITH THE FCC IT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANOTHER FACTOR
TO KEEP IN MIND. THERE ARE SIX INDIVIDUALS,
THREE REPUBLICANS, THREE DEMOCRATS. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO TAKE ACTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MAJORITY VOTETO MOVE FORWARD.
I DON'T IT'S LIKELY THIS PARTICULAR ACTION GOES ANYWHERE, BUT WE COULD SEE TRUMP TRYING TO FILE FOR
Biden and Netanyahu meet with hostages' families
INJUNCTION DOWN THE ROAD. >> WE WILL SEE IF THAT HAPPENS.
MISTY MARRIS, THANK YOU. >>> TODAY, TWO HIGH STAKES MEETINGS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
RESIDENT BIDEN MET WITH PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU DURING HIS FIRST VISIT SINCE
THE OCTOBER 7th ATTACK. AFTER HIS MEETING WITH HARRIS.
ONE DAY AFTER HIS CONTROVERSIAL SPEECH BEFORE A JOINT MEETING OF CONGRESS. INSIDE THE OVAL OFFICE IT WAS ALL SMILES. >> I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 50
YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, AND 50 YEARS OF SUPPORT FOR THE STATE
OF ISRAEL. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING WITH YOU ON THE MONTHS AHEAD AND THE GREAT ISSUES BEFORE US.
>> LET'S BRING IN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PETER ALEXANDER, FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR MORE. PETER, THE LEADERS WERE
EXPECTED TO DISCUSS THE CEASE- FIRE AGREEMENT. WAS ANYTHING ACHIEVED THERE? >> Reporter: THAT IS AN
IMPORTANT QUESTION. THIS IS ABOUT THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE VISITED SINCE IMMEDIATELY AFTER OCTOBER 7th.
TO CLOSE A CEASE-FIRE DEAL BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE, THE PRESIDENT WE ARE TOLD, PRESSED THE ISRAELI LEADER ON THIS ISSUE. OFFICIALS TELL US THE PRESIDENT
WOULD MAKE CLEAR THE ARGUMENT IT'S TIME TO CLOSE THE GAP IN NEGOTIATIONS AND GET THE HOSTAGES HOME AND END THE WAR.
AHEAD OF THIS VISIT SOME OFFICIALS INDICATED THE PRESIDENT WOULD EXERT MORE
PRESSURE ON NETANYAHU AND TAKE A TOUGHER ONE TO EMPHASIZE THE URGENCY. CLEARLY THOUGH THEY STILL
REMAIN A DISTANCE AWAY FROM ANY FILED AGREEMENT. >> AND WE KNOW BIDEN AND
NETANYAHU MET WITH THE FAMILIES OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES BEING HELD IN GAZA. HERE IS SOME OF WHAT THEY SAID.
>> WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY, AND HAS YOU KNOW, AS TIME GOES
FORWARD, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING OUR HOSTAGES HOME, OUR LOVED ONES, HOME, ALIVE, AND
RECOVERING THE BODIES OF THOSE ALREADY MURDERED, BECOMES LESS AND LESS LIKELY. >> PETER, WE'VE HEARD THAT MESSAGE FROM THOSE FAMILIES BEFORE. WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT
THEIR MEETING WITH THOSE LEADERS? >> Reporter: I THINK THE WHITE HOUSE PUT NETANYAHU ON THE SPOT
BY MEETING FAMILIES OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES. WE ARE TOLD THIS IS
UNPRECEDENTED, THE MEETING LASTED ABOUT AN HOUR. THERE WERE FAMILY MEMBERS SPEAKING WITH REPORTERS.
THE MAN SPEAKING, HIS SON WAS TAKEN, 293 DAYS AGO, HE SAYS. HE SAYS HE FEELS OPTIMISTIC, HE
SAID THEY GOT A COMMITMENT FROM BOTH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION
AND FROM NETANYAHU, HIMSELF, SAYING THEY UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY IN THIS MOMENT. IT'S NOTABLE EARLIER THOSE
FAMILIES EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AFTER NETANYAHU'S DEFIANT SPEECH TO CONGRESS, HE
EVEN CALLED THE SPEECH SHAMEFUL, VALERIE. >> SHIFTING GEARS TO VICE
PRESIDENT HARRIS, THIS COMES AT AN IMPORTANT TIME FOR HER AS
SHE FOCUSES HER MESSAGING IN ISRAEL. DID SHE SIGNAL HOW SHE WILL HANDLE THINGS MOVING FORWARD?
>> Reporter: IT WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN . THIS WAS HER FIRST MEETING WITH NETANYAHU SINCE HE
DROPPED OUT OF THE 2024 RACE. SHE DID ECHO DETAILED
COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF, TO FINISH A
CEASE-FIRE DEAL, AND ESSENTIALLY TO A TWO-STATE
SOLUTION WITH GAZA.
THE SCALE OF HUMAN SUFFERING AND DEATH IN GAZA, ON THAT SHE
SAID SHE WOULD NOT BE SILENT. AND SHE DENOUNCED SOME OF THE ACTIONS OF PROTESTERS, WHO VANDALIZED INFRASTRUCTURE, SHE
CALLED THAT DESPICABLE. SHE SEEMED TO HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THOSE PEACEFULLY DEMANDING AN END TO THE WAR SAYING, I SEE YOU, AND I HEAR YOU.
California's park fire spreads rapidly
VALERIE? >> PETER ALEXANDER, THANK YOU. PETER ALEXANDER, FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. >>> WILDFIRES ARE RAGING UP AND
ON THE WEST COAST FORCING THOUSANDS OF EVACUATIONS ACROSS
CALIFORNIA, WASHINGTON, AND OREGON. THE DURKEE FIRE IS CURRENTLY THE LARGEST ACTIVE WILDFIRE IN THE COUNTRY BURNING NEARLY
200,000 ACRES SINCE IT SPARKED OVER A WEEK AGO. IN THE PAST COUPLE DAYS IT
MERGED WITH ANOTHER WILDFIRE AND FORCED A STRETCH OF A MAJOR
HIGHWAY TO CLOSE. MEANWHILE, IN CALIFORNIA, THE PARK FIRE BURNING NORTH OF SACRAMENTO IS NOW THE STATE'S LARGEST FIRE OF THE YEAR SO FAR. OFFICIALS CONFIRMED THEY
ARRESTED A MAN SUSPECTED OF STARTING THE FIRE THAT RAPIDLY SPREAD IN JUST A FEW HOURS, DESTROYING MULTIPLE HOMES.
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN FLAMES CAME IN CONTACT WITH PROPANE TANKS IN ONE
NEIGHBORHOOD.
A TIME-LAPSE VIDEO SHOWING HOW THE FIRE SCORCHES EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH. A CAMERA AT ONE POINT
SUDDENLY WENT OFF-LINE, POSSIBLY DESTROYED BY THE FIRE ITSELF. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE TONIGHT.
NBC NEWS METEOROLOGIST MICHELLE GROSSMAN WILL HAVE THE FORECAST. FIRST THOUGH TO MORGAN CHESKY
WHO IS TRACKING THE PARK FIRE, OUTSIDE THE PERIMETER IN CHICO
AREA. >> Reporter: A BIZARRE CAUSE
HERE, THE SMOKE PLUME RISING
HIGH IN THE SKY BEHIND ME HERE, IN CHICO. THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT KNOWS WILDFIRES ALL TOO
WELL. THIS PARTICULAR BLAZE HAS BEEN A TOUGH ONE AS YOU MENTIONED THEY TOOK THAT MAN IN CUSTODY
TODAY ACCUSED OF ARSON. AUTHORITIES SAY THAT THIS MAN IS ACCUSED OF PUSHING A FLAMING
VEHICLE INTO A RAVINE, IN AN AND CREDIBLY DRY AREA, AND THAT WAS THE SPARK, THAT WAS THE
CAUSE OF THE FIRE. AND JUST ABOUT 24 HOURS,
VALERIE, IT'S NOW REACHED OVER 70,000 ACRES HERE FUELED BY THE
WINDS WE HAVE BEEN FEELING ALL DAY LONG AND INCREDIBLY DRY CONDITIONS, AND THE WOODED AREA
BEHIND ME, IT IS PRIME FUEL FOR
THE FIRE. FIREFIGHTERS WERE ABLE TO FIGHT THIS FIRE HERE 24/7 FROM THE AIR, BECAUSE CAL FIRE SAYS THEY
CAN MAKE WATER DROPS DURING THE NIGHTTIME. ANY BIT OF HELP THEY
COULD HAVE WAS USEFUL, BECAUSE
IT IS JUST 3% CONTAINED TODAY. MULTIPLE STRUCTURES DESTROYED. FORTUNATELY NO REPORTS OF
INJURIES OR DEATHS AT THIS TIME, VALERIE. >> AND, MORGAN, I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON THIS, BUT HOW WAS THE FIRE ABLE TO SPREAD SO
FAST? ARE PEOPLE ABLE TO EVACUATE IN TIME? >> Reporter: YEAH, WELL, WE DO KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN
ABLE TO GET OUT OF THOSE HARDEST HIT AREAS. WE HAD A CHANCE TO DRIVE DOWN
ONE PARTICULAR STREET WHERE MULTIPLE HOMES WERE DESTROYED BY THE FLAMES. OFFICIALS SAYING
MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RESPONSIVE TO THE EVACUATION ORDERS, WHICH
STARTED YESTERDAY. ONE GOOD POINT A FIREFIGHTER TOLD ME, THEY SAID IF YOU WAIT TO SEE THE FLAMES IT IS OFTEN
TOO LATE. YOU NEED TO GET OUT, SO FIREFIGHTERS CAN MOVE IN IN TIME IN ORDER TO PROTECT THINGS AND
PUT OUT THE FLAMES.
THIS IS A UNIQUE FIRE, IT WAS STARTED ABOUT A WEEK AGO BY A LIGHTNING STRIKE IN AN INCREDIBLY REMOTE AREA. IT HAS
CONTINUED TO CHEW THROUGH VEGETATION AND DENSELY FORESTED AREAS A QUARTER OF 1 MILLION
ACRES, THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT SWATH OF LAND.
THERE HAVE BEEN CLOSURES OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO, AND CONTAINMENT IS COMING, ALBEIT SLOWLY. AND UNFORTUNATELY
VALERIE, CONDITIONS HERE ARE NOT HELPING FIRE CREWS WHATSOEVER. HERE, IN CHICO AS WELL AS
OREGON, THERE ARE TRIPLE DIGITS IN THE FORECAST FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
VALERIE? >> MORGAN, THANK YOU FOR THE IMPORTANT REPORTING. LET'S BRING IN NBC NEWS
METEOROLOGIST , MICHELLE GROSSMAN, WITH MORE. MANY OF THESE FIRES ARE BEING
CAUSED BY LIGHTNING STRIKES FROM WHAT WE ARE CALLING "DRY
THUNDERSTORMS." >> YES, DRY THUNDERSTORMS HAPPEN A LOT WHERE RAIN FALLS,
BUT INTO A DRY AREA, SO IT WILL EVAPORATE MAJORLY, SO IT DOES NOT HYDRATE THAT VEGETATION BUT
THE LIGHTNING STRIKES COME IN.
AND THEN THE OUTER BOUNDARY GROWS THE WIND, AND THAT CAN PUSH FIRES ALONG IF IT DOES
START A FIRE. WE ARE SEEING THUNDERSTORMS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN SEE THE RADAR WITH
SHOWERS ACROSS THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST. WHERE WE ARE SEEING DRY
CONDITIONS WE HAVE SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCHES, SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNINGS. WE ARE SEEING THIS THROUGH
NEVADA, UTAH, INTO IDAHO, WYOMING, ALSO INTO COLORADO.
AS WE GO THROUGH THIS EVENING WE WILL SEE THE CHANCE FOR THESE THUNDERSTORMS AND DRY THUNDERSTORMS, ESPECIALLY IN THE YELLOW SHADING, THAT IS
WHERE WE COULD SEE SEVERE STORMS WITH GUSTY WINDS. AND, WE SEE ELEVATED FIRE RISKS. THROUGH TONIGHT, WHERE YOU SEE THE YELLOW IN GREAT FALLS,
BOWMAN, RAPID CITY, SCOTTS BLUFF, WE HAVE THE ELEVATED RISK OF FIRE DANGER.
BECAUSE, IT'S HOT, AS MORGAN MENTIONED THOSE TEMPERATURES,
AND THOSE DRY THUNDERSTORMS. THROUGH TODAY AND TOMORROW KEEP IN MIND, ALSO, IT'S JUST DRY.
WE BEGAN PEAK FIRE SEASON IN JULY. THAT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH
OCTOBER. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS IT HAS EVEN EXTENDED PAST THAT. THIS IS A RED FLAG WARNING IN
TERMS OF FIRE DANGER THROUGHOUT TOMORROW, WE ARE LOOKING ALL THAT RED SHADING, THAT'S WHERE WE COULD SEE FIRES, VALERIE.
>> WITH SO MANY FIRES BURNING AT THE SAME IME HOW IS THIS IMPACTING AIR QUALITY? >> YEAH, SO HERE'S A REALLY
NEAT GRAPH TELLING US WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THE STORY OF YES,
WE ARE SEEKING ALL THESE FIRES IN THE WEST, BUT LOOK HOW FAR THE SMOKE BLOWS. IT GOES INTO THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST, STREAMING ALL THE WAY
INTO THE PORTIONS OF THE MIDWEST, AND PARTS OF THE MIDDLE EAST SECTIONS, MAINLY
THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST, BUT IT GOES WELL BEYOND THAT. SO WE WILL SEE THAT THROUGHOUT
THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS, WATCHING THESE FIRES BURN WITH NO SIGN OF EXTINCT RICHMOND.
AS WE GO THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS WE HAVE AIR- QUALITY ALERTS. WE ARE SEEING THOSE HEATED
CONDITIONS, PLACES WHERE YOU
NEED TO CLOSE THE WINDOWS, STAY INDOORS IF YOU CAN, VALERIE.
>> A LOT TO KEEP TRACK OF,
MICHELLE GROSSMAN. THANK YOU. >>> DON'T GO ANYWHERE, WE ARE GETTING STARTED. AN OFFICER FACES CHARGES IN THAT DEADLY UVALDE SCHOOL

>>> CITING CONCERNS OVER A.I. PROTECTIONS IN A PROPOSED NEW CONTRACT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS A CRUCIAL SPEAKING POINT IN LAST YEAR'S STRIKES. WHILE

INACTION DURING THE SHOOTING AT ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, COMING FACE-TO-FACE WITH PARENTS OF
THE VICTIMS. >> SAY SOMETHING TO US. YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY SORRY TO US.
>> NBC NEWS' GUAD VANEGAS HAS MORE.
>> Reporter: VALERIE, IT WAS AN
EMOTIONAL DAY HERE. ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE TOWN SQUARE, MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARRIVED AND CREATED A MEMORIAL FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE SCHOOL
SHOOTING HERE, IN UVALDE. WAITING FOR ADRIENNE GONZALEZ
TO ARRIVE , GONZALEZ ARRIVING WITH HIS LEGAL TEAM. HE PLEADED
NOT GUILTY FOR ABANDONING OR ENDANGERING A CHILD HE IS THE
SECOND OFFICER TO FACE CHARGES AFTER THE FORMER POLICE CHIEF, PETE ARRADONDO, WAS INDICTED ON
THE SAME CHARGES. THEY WENT OVER SOME DETAILS ABOUT THE LEGAL PROCESS, AND
HOW THINGS WILL GO MOVING FORWARD. THE JUDGE ALSO SET SEPTEMBER 16th FOR THE NEXT HEARING. THAT WILL BE THE NEXT TIME WHEN
GONZALEZ IS EXPECTED TO BE BACK IN COURT FOR A PRETRIAL
HEARING. AFTER THAT HEARING HE WALKED OUTSIDE WITH HIS ATTORNEYS, AND HIS, ONE OF HIS ATTORNEYS SPOKE
TO THE MEDIA AND SAID THIS ABOUT THE CHARGES.
>> ALL HE DID WAS SHOW UP TO TRY AND HELP. WE HAVE NOT SEEN
ANY EVIDENCE THAT HE SHOULD. >> Reporter: AS HIS ATTORNEY
SPOKE WITH THE MEDIA AND THE CHARGES AGAINST MR. GONZALEZ,
MR. GONZALEZ WALKED AWAY TOWARDS HIS VEHICLE, HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO LEAVE WHILE THE ATTENTION WAS ON HIS ATTORNEY,
AND FAMILY MEMBERS OF SOME OF THE VICTIMS WERE WAITING FOR HIM, AND THEY WERE YELLING AT HIM, ASKING HIM IF HE WAS SORRY. MANY OF THESE FAMILY MEMBERS
ARRIVED WEARING T-SHIRTS WITH THE NAMES OF THOSE VICTIMS.
WE SPOKE WITH THE FATHER OF ONE OF THOSE VICTIMS. HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE CHARGES AGAINST GONZALEZ. >> YOU THOUGHT THAT YOUR LIFE
WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN OUR CHILDREN. WHY DIDN'T YOU LET THE PARENTS GO IN?
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST ONES. THEY WOULD HAVE TAKEN A BULLET, YOU KNOW?
IT IS COWARDICE ALL OVER. AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE OFFICERS ARE GUILTY. >> MOVING FORWARD, A LOT OF PARENTS ARE WONDERING IF
CHARGES WILL BE BROUGHT AGAINST ANY OTHER OFFICERS. WE KNOW HUNDREDS OF OFFICERS ARRIVED THAT DAY OF THE SHOOTING. IT WAS MULTIPLE AGENCIES.
BOTH ARRADONDO AND GONZALEZ
WERE PART OF THE FIRST AGENCY TO RESPOND. OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES, COUNTY, STATE, AND FEDERAL, DID RESPOND THAT DAY. THERE WAS A REPORT THAT
INDICATED THERE WERE MULTIPLE FAILURES THAT TOOK PLACE, BUT AS OF NOW ONLY TWO OFFICERS
HAVE BEEN INDICTED. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE IF ANY OTHER CHARGES ARE BROUGHT TO
Southwest airlines ending its open seating policy
OFFICERS WHO WERE THERE THAT DAY. >> GUAD VANEGAS, THANK YOU. >>> PARTING WAYS WITH A 50-YEAR-
OLD TRADITION. EMILIE IKEDA HAS THE STORY.
>> Reporter: A MAJOR COURSE FOR SOUTHWEST, ANNOUNCING IT WILL SOON START ASSIGNING SEATS,
ENDING MORE THAN 50 YEARS FOR
ITS MODEL OF OPEN SEATING, WHERE BOARDING CAN BUILD INTO A MAD DASH. >> YOU HAVE PEOPLE JUST RUNNING IN FRONT OF YOU.
>> Reporter: WHILE SOME SUPER FANS ARE DISAPPOINTED-- >> I LOVE OPEN SEATING, THAT'S WHY I FLY SOUTHWEST-- >> Reporter: THEY SAY IT IS A
BID TO BOOST REVENUE AND ADAPT TO TRAVELERS' CHANGING TASTE. ON LONGER FLIGHTS MORE CUSTOMERS
WANT ASSIGNED SEATS. >> FOR COMPETITORS, IT'S THE RIGHT THING AT THE RIGHT TIME.
>> Reporter: DESPITE RECORD AIR TRAVEL MANY AIRLINES ARE
STRUGGLING WITH CAPACITY. FACING GROWING RIVALRIES WITH OTHER BUDGET OPTIONS.
WHAT KIND OF HEADWIND IS THE AIRLINE FACING RIGHT NOW? >> THEY HAVE SIMPLY ADDED TOO
MANY SEATS WHEN IT COMES TO BASIC ECONOMY SEATS. IN OTHER WORDS THE SEEDS PEOPLE ARE BUYING AT THE LOWEST
POSSIBLE RATE. SO MANY ARE ADDED INTO THE SYSTEM BY SOUTHWEST, AND OTHER AIRLINES AS WELL. IT'S PUT A LID ON FARES.
>> Reporter: PREMIUM SEATS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR.
THE CHANGE REQUIRES LAYOUT CHANGES AND APPROVAL.
>> EMILIE IKEDA, THANK YOU. >>> AHEAD OF NOVEMBER'S
ELECTION, WHY SOME CLIMATE ADVOCATES ARE BEHIND KAMALA HARRIS .
>>> TRAPPED BETWEEN TWO HIGHWAY BARRIERS BEFORE IT CAUGHT ON FIRE. LUCKY FOR HIM, THE OFFICER ON
SCENE TRIED TO PUT OUT THE FLAMES, BUT WHEN IT WOULDN'T
WORK HE PULLED THE DRIVER OUT BEFORE THE CAR WAS ENGULFED IN
FLAMES. THEY ARE SAID
>>> WELCOME BACK. HERE ARE SOME OF THE STORIES HAPPENING OUT WEST WE ARE FOLLOWING.
CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER GIVING OFFICIALS THE GREEN LIGHT
TO START CLEARING HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS. THE MOVE COMES AFTER A SUPREME
COURT RULING GIVES LOCAL OFFICIALS MORE FREEDOM TO CLEAR ENCAMPMENTS AND TO GET PEOPLE FOR CAMPING ON PUBLIC PROPERTY. >>> A GROCERY STORE, IN COLORADO, WILL SOON SELL
AMMUNITION IN VENDING MACHINES. AMERICAN ROUNDS WILL HAVE THEM

FACIAL RECOGNITION TO VERIFY AGES. CUSTOMERS BUY BULLETS WITH A FEW TAPS OF THE TOUCHSCREEN.
>>> UBER AND LYFT DRIVERS, AS CONTRACTORS, INSTEAD OF
EMPLOYEES, ENDING DISPUTES ON HOW THEY SHOULD CLASSIFY THEIR EMPLOYEES.
LABOR GROUPS SAY THE LAW KEEPS
Kamala Harris' record on environmental action
WORKERS FROM BENEFITS SUCH AS MINIMUM WAGE, OVERTIME, AND SICK LEAVE. >>> NOW FOR A TEMPERATURE CHECK
ELECTION ADDITION. THERE IS AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS BEEN THE
MOST CONSEQUENTIAL PRESIDENT FOR CLIMATE ACTION IN U.S. HISTORY. IN 2022 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS CAST A TIE-BREAKING VOTE TO PASS
269 BILLION-DOLLAR CLIMATE BILL KNOWN AS THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT. DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID HE WOULD REPEAL THAT LAW AND MANY OF
BIDEN'S REGULATIONS. HOW ARE CLIMATE ACTIVISTS VIEWING THE ELECTION NOW THAT HARRIS IS AT THE TOP OF THE
TICKET? NATIONAL CLIMATE REPORTER CHASE
KANE. >> HE LITERALLY COMEST BIG OIL
COMPANIES, LOBBYISTS, HE WOULD DO THEIR BIDDING, FOR $1
BILLION IN CAMPAIGN DONATIONS. >> WE WILL DRILL, BABY, DRILL--
>> Reporter: THE PHRASE APPEARS TO BE OFFICIAL ON THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM, CALLING
FOR EXPANSION OF THE "LIQUID GOLD" UNDER OUR FEET, WHICH WOULD FURTHER HEAT THE PLANET.
SOME CLIMATE ACTIVISTS NEVER FULLY SUPPORTED PRESIDENT BIDEN.
HIGHLIGHTING VIEWS HE DID OT DO ENOUGH TO STOP OUR USE OF FOSSIL FUELS, AND THAT DISSATISFACTION CONTINUED INTO
LAST WEEK, AND WASHINGTON. >> WE NEED A NEW GENERATION OF LEADERSHIP, PEOPLE WHO ARE
ARTICULATE, BOLD, PASSIONATE, WHO CAN FIGHT FOR US. JOE BIDEN IS TOO OLD TO REALLY FIGHT THE FIGHT.
HE'S DONE SOME GOOD THINGS WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT,
ENTHUSIASTICALLY LINED UP TO SUPPORT KAMALA HARRIS, BUT WHAT
MAKES HER MORE APPEALING THAN BIDEN, ONE REASON , BACK TO 2005, WHEN DISTRICT ATTORNEY
HARRIS SOMETIME BEFORE VOTERS WERE EVEN BORN.
>> I THINK SHE HAS SPECIFICALLY A HISTORY AROUND HOLDING BIG OIL ACCOUNTABLE IN A WAY WE
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. >> ARU HIGHLIGHTED HARRIS' IN
2015 AND 2016 HARRIS
INVESTIGATED AND SUED OIL AND GAS COMPANIES. IN 2019 SHE BECAME AN EARLY SPONSOR OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL, AND IN 2020 HARRIS CAMPAIGNED AGAINST OFFSHORE DRILLING AND
FRACKING. >> OKAY, WHAT'S AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST FOR HER TO TACKLE?
>> I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A BILL THAT REALLY PUTS FORWARD HOW
TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE CAN
DECREASE OUR COST OF LIVING AND IMPROVE OUR LIVES, I THINK THAT INCLUDES HOUSING, EDUCATION, JOBS, FIRST AND FOREMOST. I THINK IS A REALLY BIG CHANCE
WE ARE ABLE TO GET BIGGER WINS UNDER HER DEMONSTRATION. >> AND CHASE KANE JOINS ME NOW. REPUBLICANS ARE ALSO USING
HARRIS' CLIMATE RECORD AGAINST
HER. THERE'S A CLIP THAT'S BEEN MAKING THE ROUNDS FROM A 2019 CNN TOWNHALL. LET'S WATCH THAT FIRST. >> IN TERMS OF WHAT WE DO, AND
CREATING INCENTIVES THAT WILL ENCOURAGE MODERATION, THAT WE
WILL BE EDUCATED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF OUR GETTING HABITS ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. >> DO YOU SUPPORT CHANGING THE
DIETARY GUIDELINES? YOU SAID RED MEAT SPECIFICALLY.
>> YES, I WOULD. >> GETTING HABITS, RED MEAT , IS SHE TALKING ABOUT A BAN? WHAT CONNECTION IS THERE TO
CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE FOOD WE EAT? >> NO, THE VICE PRESIDENT IS
NOT ADVOCATING FOR A BAN ON RED MEAT, THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT
GUIDELINES. SHE IS ADVOCATING FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS, A THIRD OF GLOBAL
EMISSIONS BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT PERSONAL CHOICES IT WOULD GO MUCH FARTHER TO THINK OF
COMPOSTING YOUR FOOD THAN NEVER GETTING RED MEAT AGAIN.
THEY ARE TRYING TO DIG THINGS UP TO WEAPONIZE AGAINST HER, OF COURSE. >> WHERE DOES CLIMATE POLICY
RANK ON VOTERS' MINDS? >> A BROAD 75% OF AMERICANS WANT
EXPANSION, BUT A RECENT POLL ASKED AMERICANS HOW IMPORTANT
IT IS FOR THEM TO REDUCE THEIR OWN CARBON FOOTPRINT.
YOU DON'T SEE A LOT THERE, BUT CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T REALLY AN INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM IT IS A
COLLECTIVE PROBLEM. WE CAN HAVE A COLLECTIVE IMPACT
ON CLIMATE ACTION BY DOING THINGS LIKE SHOWING UP AND VOTING AND NOT JUST FOR THE PRESIDENT, VOTING IN YOUR LOCAL ELECTIONS.
THAT DETERMINES HOW YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WILL IMPACT YOU, HOW
THEY WILL RESPOND TO CHANGES. >>> A HOSTAGE RESCUE LEFT OVER

>>> IT'S BEEN 50 DAYS SINCE THE
LAUNCH OF BOEING'S STARLINER.
EARLIER TODAY NASA AND BOEING ANNOUNCED THEY STILL DON'T HAVE A RETURN DATE FOR THE CAPSULE CREW, WHICH WAS ONLY SUPPOSED
TO STAY AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION FOR A CERTAIN TIME. HERE IS MORE WITH JESSE KIRSCH.
>> Reporter: STILL NO RETURN DATE FOR THE SPACECRAFT OR TWO
ASTRONAUT CREW, BUTCH, AND SUNNY
. DOCKED THERE, TEAMS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING WHAT MAY HAVE
GONE WRONG. THE GROUND TESTING OF A THRUSTER ON EARTH HAS BEEN
COMPLETED AND PRELIMINARY
FINDINGS LIKELY THE ROOT CAUSE IS TIED TO A SEAL ISSUE.
THEY NOW SAY THEY WANT TO DO TESTING OF THE THRUSTERS WHILE
DOCKED AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. ACCORDING TO NASA THEY
CHECKLIST BEFORE THE CREW COULD RETURN. THE EARLIEST, LATE NEXT WEEK.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AT LEAST ANOTHER WEEK OR LONGER THAT THESE ASTRONAUTS COULD REMAIN
AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. HERE'S PART OF WHAT OFFICIALS SHARED, EARLIER TODAY. >> RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE TEARDOWN OF THE THRUSTERS, SO WE HAVE THE THRUSTERS AT THE TEST FACILITY, IT'S IN THE LAB, IT'S BEEN
DISASSEMBLED, AND WE ARE LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE FUEL ON THE FUEL VALVE, AND THE OXIDIZER VALVE.
WE WILL SCHEDULE THAT REVIEW WHEN WE NEED TO, AND AFTER THAT
WE WILL SET THE TIMES. >> Reporter: STARLINER LIFTED
OFF, JUNE 5th. THE ASTRONAUTS WERE SUPPOSED TO SPEND ABOUT A WEEK ON BOARD THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. IF YOU THE CALENDAR THEY RE
COMING UP ON TWO MONTHS ALMOST THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ON BOARD THE ISS.
IF THEY WERE IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, THEY BELIEVE IT IS
SAFE FOR THEM TO ENTER STARLINER AND COME HOME, BUT THERE'S MORE TESTING PLAN FOR
Some people turning to A.I. for workout plans
THE DAYS AHEAD. AND THERE'S NO SET RETURN DATE FOR THAT CREW AND THAT CAPSULE. BACK TO YOU.
>> JESSE KIRSCH, THANK YOU. >>> AT THIS POINT WE CAN TURN
TO A.I. TO PLAN ACTIVITIES AND MEALS. NOW, IT CAN PLAN YOUR WORKOUTS. IT'S A GROWING TREND MANY ARE THINKING OF INSTEAD OF GOING TO
THE GYM OR HIRING A PERSONAL TRAINER. MY ENGLAND WITH MORE ON
CONDUCTING A LITTLE EXPERIMENT. >> HEY, YEAH, WE PUT A.I.
TO THE TEST. WHILE IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR SOME THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME CHALLENGES. TAKE A LOOK. >> NO TRAINER WOULD START YOU
WITHOUT A WARM-UP. >> Reporter: BOBBY WESTSIDE
WOULD HELP YOU TAILOR YOU ARE
WORKOUT PLANS WITH PERSONAL ENCOURAGEMENT.
WITH A.I., LOG ON TO CHATGPT.COM AND TYPE IN WHAT
TYPE OF WORKOUT YOU WOULD LIKE INCLUDING WHAT AREAS YOU WANTED TO FOCUS ON. I WANTED ONE SIMILAR TO THE ONE I DID WITH BOBBY.
IT GIVES ME A 10-MINUTE WORKOUT FOCUSED ON LEGS AND ABS.
>> Reporter: THEN, CHATGPT CREATED A WORK OUT FOR ME.
>> PERFORM A SQUAT, THEN JUMP.
>> Reporter: THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE GUESSWORK COMPARED TO MY PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH
BOBBY. THE PHYSICAL THERAPIST HAS BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH A.I.
WORKOUTS FOR SEVEN MONTHS. >> IT REALLY IS HIT AND MISS,
SOME EXERCISES MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. OTHERS LEFT ME
QUESTIONING WHY THEY WOULD CHOOSE THAT EXERCISE. >> Reporter: ANYONE CAN
CUSTOMIZE THEIR WORKOUT BY LETTING CHATGPT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE, WHAT EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE
AVAILABLE, AND WHAT AREAS THEY WOULD LIKE TO TARGET. EITHER ANY OF THE PIECES OF
ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DECIDING TO USE THESE A.I. MACHINES FOR OTHER WORKOUTS? >> WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM THESE
IS A LOT OF USEFUL AND ACCURATE INFORMATION. WHAT YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY EXPECT IS FULL
COMPREHENSIVENESS AND 100% ACCURACY. >> Reporter: ONE STUDY FOUND
ABOUT 40% OF A.I. GENERATED WORKOUTS WERE COMPREHENSIVE, ONE LAST
IMPORTANT PIECE OF ADVICE. >> I WOULD REALLY FOCUS ON WHAT YOU ARE TELLING THE A.I. WHEN YOU PROMPT IT.
THAT SHOULD BE A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG PROPPED PROMPT THAT
WOULD ANSWER QUESTIONS THE TRAINERS WOULD ASK. ARE THERE THINGS YOU ARE NOT
COMFORTABLE DOING MARK WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THE GYM? >> BOTH BOBBY AND DR. CHONA

RIVER. >> THE RIVER TWISTS SO OFTEN. >> Reporter: RUSSELL KELLY,
AMERICAN HISTORIAN, HAS LIVED HERE FOR 30 YEARS. HE SAYS PARIS BEGAN ON AN
ISLAND ON THE SEINE, NOW KNOWN FOR ITS FAMOUS CATHEDRAL.
