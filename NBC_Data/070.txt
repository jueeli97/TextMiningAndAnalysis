WANT TO SEE THE CONFLICT SPREAD
OR ESCALATE.
THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF OUR GOALS
FROM DAY ONE FROM OCTOBER 7 ON
AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT.
>> NBC NEWS INTERNATIONAL
CORRESPONDENT RAF SANCHEZ WAS
THERE.
>> Reporter: IT WAS AFTER 6:00
ON A NORMAL SATURDAY NIGHT WITH
KIDS PLAYING ON THE SOCCER
FIELD AND THEN THE SIRENS
STARTED BLARING AND THE ROCKETS
CAME CRASHING DOWN HERE,
KILLING THOSE 12 CHILDREN.
THERE IS A MEMORIAL HERE AT ALL
BETWEEN AGE 10 AND AGE 16.
IT BROUGHT DEATH AND
DESTRUCTION TO THE COMMUNITY
ALSO PUTTING THE MIDDLE EAST ON
EDGE.
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SAID IT
WAS HEZBOLLAH WHO DOMINATES
SOUTHERN LEBANON AND FIRED THE
ROCKET.
HEZBOLLAH DENIES THIS BUT
ISRAEL SAID THEY DO NOT HAVE
ANY DOUBT AND THAT THEY WILL
STRIKE BACK AND THE MEETING
OVERNIGHT AUTHORIZED PRIME
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TO
CHOOSE THE TIME AND PRIME
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU
SAID IT WOULD BE ON A SCALE WE
HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE . THE
UNITED STATES IS SAYING IT
SUPPORTS THE RIGHT OF ISRAEL TO
DEFEND ITSELF BUT IS URGING

NORTHERN BORDER WHEN THEY ARE
TRYING TO FINALIZE A CEASE-FIRE

A MISTAKE. THIS IS NOT THE KIND
OF ATTACK THAT IS NOT GOING TO
GO ANSWERED AND THERE IS A LOT
OF OUTRAGE, AS RAF SANCHEZ WAS
JUST SAYING AND RIGHT NOW IN
LEBANON THERE IS AN ENORMOUS
AMOUNT OF FEAR BECAUSE THERE IS
IS FEELING WHAT THE BEST
MAJORITY DID NOT VOTE DIRECTLY
FOR HEZBOLLAH, THEY HAVE SEATS
IN THE PARLIAMENT AND THE
ABILITY TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS
AND DIPLOMACY. THIS IS A
POWERFUL ORGANIZATION THAT HAS
LIKE 160,000 DIFFERENT
PROJECTILES TARGETING WEAPONS
THAT COULD REACH DEEP INTO
ISRAEL.
EVEN IF THERE WAS ESCALATION
THAT HEZBOLLAH WOULD PROBABLY
FIGHT BACK AND THEN IT WOULD BE
THE CIVILIANS IN THE CROSSFIRE
LIKE WE HAVE SEEN TO BEAR THE
BRUNT OF THIS .
>> YOU AND I HAVE TALKED BEFORE
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE WAR
ESCALATION AND DOES THIS FEEL
DIFFERENT?
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE THING
IS BEEN HARD TO PARSE THE SO
BECAUSE EVERY DAY WE WONDER IF
THIS IS THE BIG ONE . SO FAR
THERE HAS NOT BEEN THAT KIND OF
OUTBREAK AND MOVEMENT WHEN THE
