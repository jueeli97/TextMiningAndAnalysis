PATTERNS ARE CHANGING.
THESE CHANGES ARE SHAPING OUR
WORLD.
CLIMATE REPORTER CHASE CAIN
TAKES A LOOK.
>> FIVE MILES WIDE, ABOUT 25
MILES LONG.
>> Reporter: FLYING ABOVE
ALASKA'S EXPENSIVE ICE FIELDS
-- EXPECT THIS IS ALL NEW RIGHT
HERE.
THIS BROKE OFF PROBABLY ABOUT
TWO WEEKS AGO.
>> Reporter: YOU COULD CLEARLY
SEE THE SIGNS OF CLIMATE
CHANGE.
>> IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
BUT, IT'S ALSO JUST SO SAD.
>> WE DON'T HAVE DECADES, WE
HARDLY HAVE YEARS.
>> Reporter: RESEARCH NOW
CONFIRMS THESE GLACIERS ARE ON
THE BRINK, SOME ALREADY PAST
THE POINT OF NO RETURN.
>> IF IT RISES ABOVE THE
ICEFIELD YOU WON'T HAVE ANY
MORE SNOW INCOME, THE TIPPING
POINT IN THIS CASE IS NO MORE
INCOME. IN THE CASES WHERE I'VE
TAKEN MEASUREMENTS, THEY ARE
NOW GONE.
>> Reporter: HAS STUDIED
ALASKA'S EVOLVING LANDSCAPE
OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES.
WHAT ARE THE CHANGES YOU
OBSERVED RECENTLY THAT ARE I
IMAGINE QUITE DIFFERENT THAN
INDICATES PRAYER?
>> 1948, 1990, IT WAS, IN 2010
REALLY INCREASED.
>> Reporter: TRENDS HAVE
TRIGGERED DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCES
ON WEATHER PATTERNS ALREADY.
ENTIRE ECOSYSTEMS.

THAT USED TWO SLOW THIS WELL IS
NOT THERE ANYMORE.
>> Reporter: AND IT'S PLAYING
OUT ACROSS THE ENTIRE ARCTIC.
>> PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THE
ARCTIC IS CHANGING FASTER THAN
ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET.
WERE THESE BRIGHT SERVICES ARE
IT'S MAKING US DARKER.
MORE OF THE SUN'S ENERGY IS
BEING ABSORBED WHETHER IT IS
OCEAN ORELAND.
>> DARKER COLORS ABSORBED MORE
OF THE SUN'S ENERGY WHILE WHITE
AND LIGHTER COLORS REFLECT THAT
HEAT HELPING YOU STAY COOLERS.
GLACIERS WORK THE SAME WAY
REFLECTING THAT ENERGY BACK TO
SPACE.
THE MORE THAT WE LOSE THE
HOTTER EARTH GETS, ACCELERATING
CLIMATE CHANGE.
EVEN THESE RULES OF CLIMATE
CHANGE SEEMED TO BE BREAKING
DOWN IN PARTS OF THE ARC TAKE.
>> THEIR TEAM RETURNED FROM AN
EXPEDITION IN NORWAY.

CLIMATE OR SOMETHING YOU HAVE
BEEN TRACKING THE SUMMER.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, VALERIE.
IF WE LOOK, LAST WEEK, WE WERE
SEEING TEMPERATURES IN THE
UPPER 80s AND EVEN 90 DEGREES.
MANY IN THE LOWER 48 MIGHT
THINK THAT'S NOT THAT HOT, BUT
THESE TEMPERATURES ARE 16
DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE. WHEN WE
ZOOM OUT AND LOOK AT JUST LAST
YEAR ACROSS THE ARCTIC THE
ARCTIC CIRCLE SAW ITS SIXTH
WARMEST YEAR. LAST SUMMER IN THE
ARCTIC IT WAS THE WARMEST
SUMMER EVER RECORDED, AND THAT'S
IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THAT'S THE

MOST OF THE POLAR ICE, THESE
GLACIERS, MELTING.
FURTHER, OVER THE LAST CENTURY
OR SO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN
THE ARCTIC, YOU SEE HOW QUICKLY
