CHANGED AND NOW IT IS HARRIS WHO IS CHOOSING WHO WILL BE ON THE TICKET WITH HER AND SHE HAS
A COUPLE CHOICES WITH TODAY A POLITICAL BATTLEGROUND STATE BUT SHE DOES NOT HAVE MUCH TIME
TO CHOOSE A RUNNING MATE. SO BEYOND THAT, SHE WILL HAVE TO
FIND A MESSAGE THAT IS GOING TO RESONATE. RESONATE. TODAY SHE IS COMING OUT AGAINST
THE BAN BUDGETS TOOK EFFECT IN IOWA. SHE WILL BE HAMMERING ABORTION RIGHTS AND THIS IS SOMETHING
DEMOCRATS WILL BELONG BRING PEOPLE TO THE POLLS. SHE IS YOUNGER AND IS FRESH AIR

A BRAND-NEW STRATEGY WITH JUST 99 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION DAY. GABE? >> IT DOES FEEL LIKE SEVERAL
MONTHS IN POLITICAL TERMS. WHILE THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS WHILE THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS
RAMPING UP, REPUBLICANS ARE
RAMPING UP THEIR ATTACKS AND THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN PUSHED BACK.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? >> Reporter: THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO TREAT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT THEY STAND FOR AND WHAT THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN STANDS FOR. WEIRD HAS BEEN THE LATEST LINE OF ATTACK ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE AISLE.

ARE LOOKING AT THIS NEW FACE. THE PERSON THAT WILL JOIN HER
ALSO. THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A REAL THAT IS GOING TO HAVE A REAL
IMPACT AND SOMETHING SHE BRINGS
UP THAT REALLY RESONATES WITH VOTERS IS ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION AND HOW TO PLAY

WHO OF COURSE IS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR THE ROLE OF VICE PRESIDENT AND ALSO IN QUESTION IS GOVERNOR GRETCHEN
WHITMER . SOMEONE TOLD ME HE
REALLY LOVES GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO BUT HE DOES WANT HARRIS TO WIN.
SO IF GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO HELPS HER TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA HELPS HER TO WIN PENNSYLVANIA
COME HE IS ALL FOR IT.
THERE IS A TOTALLY NEW VIBE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN A WAY THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN UP UNTIL THIS POINT.
MOSTLY THE ENERGY HAS BEEN ON THE REPUBLICANS AND WE WERE JUST AT THE RNC TO SAY HOW JUST AT THE RNC TO SAY HOW
UNIFIED THE GOP WAS AND NOW THE
TABLES HAVE TURNED A LITTLE BIT AND SOME SAY THAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS FUMBLED WITH HIS CHOICE OF J.D.

THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN GEORGIA.
ALSO THE ATTEMPT TO WIN OVER OR
REPUBLICAN LEANING PERCENT ANDY BESHEAR WAS SPEAKING TO THOSE
VOTERS AND THIS TELLS SEE HOW THE CAMPAIGN IS REACHING EVERY THE CAMPAIGN IS REACHING EVERY
SINGLE POSSIBLE VOTER THAT IT
CAN. ONE THING THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU IS A SPOKE WITH VOLUNTEERS AND THEY ALL ACKNOWLEDGE EVEN IF THERE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF
PRESIDENT BIDEN, IT FEELS DIFFERENT LIKE EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE AM EXCITED ABOUT THE SAME PAGE AM EXCITED ABOUT
THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THE
CANDIDACY OF VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS I WOULD LIKE YOU TO YOUR HOW CONGRESSMAN HANK JOHNSON WHO DO NOT CALL ON BIDEN TO
STEP DOWN, HOW HE DESCRIBED THE CURRENT MOMENT THAT WE ARE IN. >> IT HAS BEEN LIKE ENTERING SUNLIGHT.
THE SUN IS OUT SHINING BRIGHTL . THE SKY IS BLUE AND CLEAR. . THE SKY IS BLUE AND CLEAR. THE WAY FORWARD IS CLARIFIED
AND PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE AND PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE DIRECTION THAT WE ARE HEADED IN. THEY SGREAT ABOUT HAVING SOMEONE AT THE HEAD OF OUR TICKET THAT WE CAN ALL GET
BEHIND, AND THAT IS KAMALA HARRIS. SHE IS READY TO SERVE. PEOPLE VERY CONFIDENT WITH HER. WE ARE READY TO MOVE FORWARD. >> Reporter: THIS CONFIDENCE IS WHAT I'M ALSO HEARING FROM
VOTERS . ALSO ATTRACTING NEW VOLUNTEERS, 6000 OVER THE LAST WEEKEND WITH TWO ON OFFICE

SEE HER HIT SOME OF THE ISSUES LIKE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS , THE LIKE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS , THE ECONOMY. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS
HAS BEEN TO GEORGIA SEVERAL TIMES THIS YEAR AND ALL OF HER INITIATIVES HAVE BROUGHT HER TO INITIATIVES HAVE BROUGHT HER TO
GEORGIA. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO TOUT THE
ACCOMPLISHMENTS ECONOMICALLY. SO I EXPECT HER TO SORT OF HIT ON THOSE SAME TOPICS ALSO
CONSIDERING AND CONSIDERING THIS NEW THEME THAT WE ARE HEARING
AND MAINTAINING THE FUTURE AND MAINTAINING THAT TRUMP WANTS TO BRING US TO THE BEST AND HER EXPERTS AS A PROSECUTOR.
EXPERTS AS A PROSECUTOR. SHE HAS A NEW GO TO REFRAIN
THAT SHE CAN BE THE PROSECUTOR AND THAT MAKES HER EQUIPPED TO TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP IN THIS
MOMENT. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, NNAMDI.
AT LEAST EIGHT OR ON THE RADAR FOR VICE PRESIDENT FULL SO WE WILL BRING IN TWO REPORTERS WHO
HAVE BEEN COVERING REPORTERS FOR YEARS AND IN PHOENIX AND
FOR YEARS AND IN PHOENIX AND THEN THERE IS IN PHILADELPHIA
LAUREN MAYK WHO HAS BEEN
COVERING GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH YOU, LAUREN.
WE JUST HEARD FROM DASHA. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT HOW
THIS STACKS UP AND WENT GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO COULD BRING TO THE TICKET IN BRING TO THE TICKET IN
PENNSYLVANIA? >> Reporter: GABE, I THINK IF YOU WERE TO ASK THE
PHILADELPHIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY THEY WOULD SAY WHAT THEY WOULD
GET WOULD BE PENNSYLVANIA AND HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS HERE IN THE STATE OF DEMOCRATS HERE IN THE STATE OF
PENNSYLVANIA PUSHING FOR GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO TO
ENJOYING THE HARRIS TICKET. THE CAMPAIGN TO PUSH FOR GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO AS THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE STARTED AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN
THAT THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN
STARTED LAST WEEK , LAST
WEEKEND. GET STARTED QUICKLY. WE HAVE SEEN OFFICIALS COME INTO FOR HIM. THERE HAS BEEN A MOVE FROM
UNION OFFICIALS OF THE WILL TO REALLY HYPED HIM UP. I WAS AT AN EVENT ON FRIDAY THAT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS PART RALLY FOR KAMALA HARRIS AND
PART RALLY FOR GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO. THEY'RE REALLY PUSHING FOR HIM. WE ARE IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY RIGHT NOW IN THE PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS.
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN SUPERGIANT HIS VOTES IN 2020. GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO RAN EVEN AHEAD OF WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN
AHEAD OF WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN
DID IN HIS OWN RACE IN 2022
OF COURSE THIS IS NOT HIS HOME
COUNTY, BUT THAT WAS ALSO THE SAME IN BUCKS COUNTY AS WELL AS IN ERIE COUNTY IN NORTHWEST PENNSYLVANIA.
SO HE DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO PLATE WELL NOT JUST IN HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC AREAS BUT IN OTHER, MORE PURPLE AND EVEN SOME RIG AREAS AS WELL. I WILL POINT OUT THAT THERE IS
ALSO PUSHBACK AND THERE IS AN AD RUNNING AGAINST GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO TO SAY HE HAS NOT GOTTEN ANYTHING DONE. THERE IS ALSO SOME DEMOCRATS WHO ARE NOT HAPPY WITH SOME OF
HIS POSITIONS ON SCHOOL VOUCHERS. SO TO HIS BEEN TALKED ABOUT HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA PER GABE? >> YOU MENTIONED STRENGTHS AND
WEAKNESSES. HOW DO YOU THINK THE HARRIS HOW DO YOU THINK THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN DIRECT TO THAT AND DO
SOME MORE OF THE POTENTIAL WEAKNESSES THAT YOU SEE LOCALLY? I KNOW THERE WAS TALK ABOUT
SOME OF HIS STAFFERS AT SOME POINT AND HIS RESPONSE. DO YOU THINK THIS MIGHT BE AGAINST HIM IF HE BECOMES A
VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE? >> Reporter: IT WAS SOMETHING
THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE NOMINEE WHO POSTED ABOUT WHAT
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. THERE WERE CLAIMS AGAINST A STAFF. THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT AND SET
THROUGH SUPPORT WITH ROY COOPER, GOVERNOR COOPER INSTEAD
OF GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO. I SPOKE WITH THE HEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN PENNSYLVANIA ABOUT THAT POST BY
THEIR NOMINEE AND HE SAID HE WAS OFFENDED BY THAT AND IS BACKING GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO
FOR THIS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL, BUT HOW WILL THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN VIEW THAT?
WE WILL SEE. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH PAY LAUREN >> THANK YOU SO MUCH PAY LAUREN

SOME TRUMP-KELLY DISTRICTS DURING THE ELECTION AND DISTRICT FOR THE VOTERS WENT
FOR BOTH SENATOR MARK KELLY AND DONALD TRUMP AND OF COURSE
HE HAS THE BORDER GOING FOR HIM AND THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR KAMALA HARRIS HERE IN
ARIZONA, AND EVEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SENATOR MARK KELLY NOT AFRAID TO PUSH BACK AND SAID AND IN TITLE 42 WAS , QUOTE, DUMB.
TITLE 42 WAS , QUOTE, DUMB. JUST THIS MORNING INTERVIEWED
RUBEN GALLEGO AND HE DID NOT HAVE AN ANSWER.

LOOKING FOR INTEGRATE WITH J.D. VANCE HE WILL GET A SOLID PERFORMANCE AND IN THE PAST THERE IS THIS ISSUE WITH THIS
BALLOON COMPANY IN TUCSON THAT HE HELPED TO GET OFF OF THE HE HELPED TO GET OFF OF THE
GROUND. THE GOAL WAS TO
DEVELOP SPACE TOURISM. THAT NEVER REALLY HAPPENED. IT DID HAVE A SMALL INVESTMENT
BY A CHINESE COMPANY AND HE TALKED TO AN EXECUTIVE AND ALSO TALKED TO AN EXECUTIVE AND ALSO
QUESTIONS ABOUT TAX BREAKS FROM THE CITY OF TUCSON AND WHETHER
OR NOT THERE WAS A RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT. THAT'S KIND OF MELTED AWAY AND THAT IS BEEN OUT THERE IN THE

>> DO YOU AGREE THERE IS PEOPLE WHO LOVE THE COUNTRY AND ARE INVESTED IN ITS FUTURE BUT THEY
INVESTED IN ITS FUTURE BUT THEY ALSO HAPPEN TO BE CHILDLESS?

REAL WAVES OR IS THIS ANOTHER LONG LINE OF COMMENTS LIKE I WILL BE A DICTATOR THAT REALLY MIGHT I WROTE SOME DEMOCRATS?
MIGHT I WROTE SOME DEMOCRATS? >> WE HAVE SEEN THESE OFFHAND COMMENTS COME FROM THE FORMER
COMMENTS COME FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT SEVERAL TIMES IN THIS
ONE I THINK IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT PLAYS INTO THE IDEA THAT DEMOCRATS UP AND HAMMERING
THAT DEMOCRATS UP AND HAMMERING THIS IS DEMOCRACY ON THE LINE
AND WHAT HAVE YOU NOT MY DECISION TO MAKE. FOR OTHERS THIS COULD BE ONE
THAT WRINKLES DEMOCRATS AND WE SEE THEM TRYING TO HAMMER HOME ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. IT IS JUST ONE OF SEVERAL COMMENTS FROM THE FORMER
PRESIDENT. >> ON THOSE COMMENTS BUT ALSO ON THE COMMENTS OF J.D. VANCE, IS THIS MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING? >> FOR THE MILLION DO NOT VOTE
EVERY SINGLE CYCLE. THEY AGREE WITH AMERICA FIRST POSITIVE THAT THEY DO NOT GO TO THE
POLLS. IF THEY DID WE WOULD NEVER LOSE
ELECTIONS . THEY SAID IF WE DO EVERYTHING TRYST WITH THE GREATNESS OF THIS COUNTRY WILL EVERYONE ON OUR SIDE AT THIS
POINT OR HE COULD BE SAYING THIS IS MY LOST TIME ON THE BALLOT. THAT IS PART OF WHAT HE DOES.

REAL PROBLEM IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE ON AS AMERICA AND HE

EVERY DAY IS GOING TO COUNT. IT
WILL STILL BE A CLOSER LOOK. GRASSROOTS ENTHUSIASM AND THE GRASSROOTS ENTHUSIASM AND THE ENTHUSIASM ON THE. I JUST THINK
IT IS THE WHOLE PARTY UNITING AROUND HER AND ONE OF THE LARGEST EVENTS IN WISCONSIN
DEMOCRATS HAVE HAD IN MORE THAN 10 YEARS. I KNOW WE ALL THINK
IT IS A SUGAR HIGH, BUT THAT IS JUST A GUESS. THERE IS A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM.
THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE IT CAN GO 99 DAYS AND A LOT OF THE
FOCUS HAS NOT GONE TO TRUMP YET AND J.D. VANCE. THAT IS THE LIST OF BEEN
SOMETHING HE SAID IN THAT COMMENT. COMMENT. HE DID SAY THAT WOMEN SHOULD
STAY IN ABUSE MARRIAGES. THE REASON HE CANNOT TAKE IT
BACK IS BECAUSE THAT IS THE LEAST OFFENSIVE THING. >> SHE IS MORE RADICAL THAN JOE
BIDEN AND LESS LIKABLE. WHERE SHE IS IN A CHEVRON IS SHE IS IN A CHEVRON IS
SUPPORTING HER, IT IS GOING TO BE A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE
FIND OUT THE PRESS CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. SHE RANKED EIGHTH AMONGST DEMOCRATS BEHIND BERNIE SANDERS DEMOCRATS BEHIND BERNIE SANDERS

NOT POPULAR. PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE HER. SHE HAS HAD HER SHOT MANY TIMES AND THEY KEEP TRYING TO
REPURPOSE HER AND BRING HER OUT. THAT IS WHAT SHE IS BEEN IN THIS BUBBLE BY DEMOCRATS. DO NOT LET HER TALK A LOT
BECAUSE WHEN SHE DOES SHE MAKES THESE FOIBLES THAT ARE SO UNPOPULAR AND SO CHARMLESS, THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET HUNDRED.

BUBBLE THAT SHE WASN'T POPULAR BEFORE AND NOW THEY LETTER OUT? BUT YOU THINK SHE WAS IN A BUBBLE BEFORE? ON THE DEBATE STAGE AFTER
ON THE DEBATE STAGE AFTER CALLING JOE BIDEN A
SEGREGATIONIST AND A SEX CRIMELINE SHE HAD T-SHIRTS READY TO GO AND SHE COULD NOT
