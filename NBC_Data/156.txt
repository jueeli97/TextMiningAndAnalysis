>>> WE ARE FOLLOWING BREAKING
NEWS.
A MAJOR PRISONER SWAP IS
CURRENTLY UNDERWAY BETWEEN
RUSSIA, THE U.S. AND OTHER
NATIONS.
THAT'S ACCORDING TO A SENIOR
BIDEN MENSTRUATION OFFICIAL.
WE KNOW THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED
TO A PRISONER TRANSFER AND ARE
IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE
EXPECTED TO SOON BE IN U.S.
CUSTODY.
LET'S BRING AN NBC NEWS REPORTER MATT.
REPORTER MATT.
RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT THERE IS
NOT A LOT WE CAN REPORT ABOUT
THIS EXCHANGE AND THINGS WE
DON'T KNOW INCLUDING WHO IS
PART OF IT, RIGHT ?
>> Reporter: THAT'S CORRECT.
THERE'S A LOT OF KEY DETAILS WE
ARE WAITING TO HEAR.
SPECIFICALLY WEAR THIS TAKING
PLACE AND WHO IS INVOLVED.
WHAT WE KNOW THERE ARE A LARGE
NUMBER OF RUSSIANS IN U.S.
CUSTODY AND A LOT OF THEM BEING
MIDTIER CYBER CRIMINALS,
CONVICTED RUSSIAN SPIES A LOT
OF PEOPLE OF THAT NATURE.
THERE ARE PROMINENT U.S.
CITIZENS IN RUSSIAN DETENTION.
THAT BEING THE WALL STREET
JOURNAL EVAN GERSHKOVICH, PAUL
WHALEN.
HE'S BEEN WRONGFULLY DETAINED
IN RUSSIA FOR MUCH LONGER THAN
EVAN HAS.
THERE ARE OTHER NAMES THAT
WE'VE BEEN COVERING FOR SOME
TIME.
WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION
OR CONFIRMATION WHO IS INVOLVED
IN THE TRADE.
WE ARE SEEING MANY SIGNS SOME
FROM THE RUSSIAN SITE THAT THIS
IS A LARGE TRADE.
WE'VE BEEN SEEING RUSSIAN
SPECIAL GOVERNMENT FLIGHTS
TAKING OFF FROM MOSCOW AND
FLYING IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS. SOME AIRPLANES PREVIOUSLY USED
SOME AIRPLANES PREVIOUSLY USED
IN HIGH-PROFILE SWAPS.
THE RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA HAS
BEEN REPORTING ON RUSSIA SPIES
DETAINED IN SLOVENIA BEING
RELEASED.
GIVEN THAT INFORMATION WHAT WE
DO NOTE THERE IS THIS SWAP
UNDERWAY BETWEEN RUSSIA, THE
U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES AS YOU
MENTIONED.
IT DOES APPEAR WE'RE LOOKING AT
A LARGE MOVEMENT OF PRISONERS.
AS YOU SAID, WE ARE WAITING FOR
A LOT OF INFORMATION.
>> WE DO NOT KNOW WHO IS
INVOLVED IN THIS PRISONER
EXCHANGE BUT DO NOTE THERE HAVE
BEEN EFFORTS TO GET WALL STREET
JOURNAL REPORTED EVAN
GERSHKOVICH OUT OF RUSSIA.
HE WAS RECENTLY CONVICTED AND
SENTENCED.
WHAT DOES HIS SITUATION IN
RUSSIA STAND RIGHT NOW ?
>> Reporter: HE WAS SENTENCED A
WEEK AGO TO 16 YEARS IN A
RUSSIAN COLONY ON CHARGES OF
ESPIONAGE.
HE'S BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN
TARGETS FOR A U.S.-RUSSIA TRADE
SINCE HE WAS DETAINED BACK IN
MARCH 2023.
HE'S BEEN ONE OF THE NAMES AT
THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR THIS
ARRANGEMENT.
AFTER LAST WEEK'S SENTENCING,
HE WAS FACING 16 YEARS IN A
RUSSIAN PENAL COLONY.
RUSSIA TAKES ESPIONAGE VERY
SERIOUSLY.
OF ALL THE CHARGES YOU CAN FACE
IN RUSSIA, IT IS THE WORST TO
FACE.
THE ACQUITTAL RATE ACROSS THE
RUSSIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS VERY
LOW FOR ALL CRIMES.
BELOW 1 %. YOU ARE LOOKING AT A
SITUATION WHERE IT'S WORSE WITH
ESPIONAGE.
JUST AS PAUL WHELAN DID.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT
EVAN IS ON THE SAME CHARGES AS
PAUL WHELAN WHO HAS BEEN THERE
FOR FIVE YEARS.
PAUL WHELAN HAS SEEN MULTIPLE
TRADES LIKE THIS COME AND GO.
HE'S BEEN LEFT OUT EACH AND
EVERY TIME.
ALL THIS UNDERSCORES HOW
SERIOUS IT IS TO BE ACCUSED OF
ESPIONAGE AND CHARGED WITH IT
IN RUSSIA.
>> THE U.S.-RUSSIA AND OTHER
NATIONS INVOLVED WITH THIS, HOW
UNUSUAL IT MAY THAT BE ? ARE
THESE EXCHANGES OFTEN ONE
COUNTRY WITH ANOTHER COUNTRY ?
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY.
MULTILATERAL PRISONER EXCHANGE
IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO
IN IDEAL TIMES.
EACH COUNTRY HAS DIFFERENT RULES.
RULES.
IF THIS IS A MULTILATERAL, SO
TO SPEAK, PRISONER TRADE, WE
ARE LOOKING AT ONE OF THE
LARGEST TRADES OF THIS KIND
SINCE THE COLD WAR POSSIBLY
EVEN MORE THAN THAT LOOKING AT
WHAT THE SIZE OF THIS COULD BE.
IT SHOULD NOT BE UNDERSTATED
HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS MOVEMENT
WOULD BE IF IT PLAYS OUT THE
WAY WE THINK IT MAY. >> REMIND US WHY WE ARE BEING
>> REMIND US WHY WE ARE BEING
SO CAUTIOUS WITH WHAT WE CAN
REPORT.
THIS IS A SENSITIVE SITUATION.
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY.
THE TRADE IS IN PROCESS.
IT'S UNDERWAY.
IT HAS NOT BEEN A DONE DEAL.
