THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE
TO KNOCK ON DOORS, DO ALL THE
THINGS IT WILL TAKE TO HELP
THEM WIN.
>> YAMICHE ALCINDOR, LIVE FOR
US.
ALEX, WHILE THE VP HEADS TO
ATLANTA TO TALK TO BLACK
VOTERS, AS REPORTED, WHITE
DUDES GATHERED YESTERDAY IN
HER NAME.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT
QUICK
>> YEAH, THIS IS A LITTLE BIT
OF A CHEEKY EVENT.
IT WAS A STAR-STUDDED ZUNE CALL.
KIND OF A THROWBACK TO THE
COVID DAYS.
A PARADE OF BEIGE, AS ACTOR
BRADLEY WHITFORD PUT IT.
MARK KAMEL, WHO PLAYED LUKE
SKYWALKER.
JOSH GROBAN, LANCE BASS FROM IN
SYNC. JUST A WHOLE BUNCH OF
HOLLYWOOD ROYALTY.
IN ADDITION TO ABOUT HALF OF,
HARRIS' VP LIST.
RAISING OVER $4 MILLION.
IT WAS AN INTERESTING MIX OF
SELF-DEPRECATING JOKES.
SAYING BY OUR HATS, NOT THE
TRUCKER HEADS THAT WHITE MEN
USUALLY WEAR WHEN THEY COME
TOGETHER, MAKING FUN OF THE
CLANS.
THE MAJORITY WHO ARE WITH
DONALD TRUMP, THAT'S BEEN THE
BACKBONE OF HIS SUPPORT.
AND THEY ARE HOPING TO RAISE
AWARENESS AS A DEMOGRAPHIC,
WHICH IS NOT REALLY A GROUP WE
TALKED ABOUT.
IT'S KIND OF BEEN THE DEFAULT.
AND IT'S ONE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE
NOT PAID ATTENTION TO IN THE
PAST.
HARRIS IS NOT GOING TO WIN
WHITE MEN.
THAT'S MORE OF TRUMP'S
DEMOGRAPHIC.
THERE ARE SO MANY THAT CAN
REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
AND THE MONEY THEY RAISE OUT OF
THIS CAR WON'T HURT EITHER.
>> YOU KNOW, SO MUCH OF
POLITICS, WE THINK OF POLITICAL
RALLIES.
THAT'S THE TRADITIONAL WAY TO
SENSE VOTER ENTHUSIASM.
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THESE ZOOM
MEET UP?
AND DOES THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN
EXPECT TO USE THAT TO THEIR
ADVANTAGE?
MAKE YES, ABSOLUTELY.
ONE OF THE FIRST EVENT THAT
HERE IS DID WAS THE ZUNE CALL
WITH A BLACK WOMAN THAT JUST
EXPLODED. THAT THERE WAS A
WHITE WOMAN CALL THAT RAISED 8
1/2 MILLION DOLLARS.
I THINK ALL OF THIS IS A SIGN
OF THE ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY
FOR KAMALA HARRIS.
SINCE PROBABLY 2008 WHEN BARACK
OBAMA RAN.
THEY ARE SUDDENLY FIRED UP
