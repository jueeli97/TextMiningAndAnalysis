>>> WELCOME TO MEET THE PRES NOW. I'M GABE GUTIERREZ I
WASHINGTON WE ARE FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENT FOREIGN AND DOMESTICIC WE ARE TRACKING THE FALLOU
AFTER ONE OF HAMAS'S SENIO LEADERS WAS KILLED IN IRAN AND
AFTER HEZBOLLAH STRUCK FRO LEBANON. IRAN IS VOWING RETALIATION AND
FEARS OF ESCALATION IN THE REGION >>> WE BEGIN WITH THE LATEST
DEVELOPMENTS IN A TRANSFORME RACE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP WRAPPED UP A CONTENTIOUS
AND HEATED CONVERSATION AT THE ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS IN CHICAGO . HE WAS ASKED IF HE BELIEVES VICE
PRESIDENT HARRIS IS A D.E.I. CANDIDATE AS HIS ALLIES HAVE
SAID IN ANSWERING THE QUESTION, H QUESTIONED HER RACIAL IDENTITY
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS OF INDIA HERITAGE AND SHE WAS ONL PROMOTING INDIAN HERITAGE.
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS BLAC UNTIL A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN SHE HAPPENED TO TURN BLACK AND
NOW SHOW WANTS TO BE KNOWN A BLACK. SO I DON'T KNOW, IS SHE INDIAN
OR BLACK I RESPECT EITHER ONE BUT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T. SHE WAS INDIAN ALL THE WAY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE WENT
TURN AND SHE BECAME A BLAC PERSON >> JUST TO BE CLEAR, SIR --.
>> THE FORMER PRESIDENT ALSO ATTACKED ONE OF THE JOURNALIST ASKING QUESTIONS AS WELL AS TH
VICE PRESIDENT FOR INITIALLY FAILING THE BAR EXAM HE DEFENDED THE RIOTERS WH
STORMED THE CAPITAL ON JANUARY 6th AND ACCUSED THE BIDE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OF GOIN AFTER HIM BECAUSE HE WAS A
POLITICAL OPPONENT THISWHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETAR
DESCRIBED IT AS INSULTING. THE COMMENTS COME AS TRUMP HAS A
RALLY BEFORE AND ON STAGE HARRIS CHALLENGED
TRUMP DIRECTLY >> HE WON'T DEBATE BUT HIS RUNNING MATE SURE SEEMS TO HAV
A LOT TO SAY ABOUT ME. AND BY THE WAY, DON'T YOU FIND SOME OF THEIR STUFF TO JUST BE
PLAIN WEIRD? WELL, DONALD, I DO HOPE YOU WILL
RECONSIDER TO MEET ME ON THE
DEBATE STAGE BECAUSE AS THE SAYING GOES, IF
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, SAY
IT >> THE FIRED UP CROWD ALSO BROKE OUT INTO LOUD CHANTS OF LOCK HIM
UP THE VICE PRESIDENT IS NOW DAYS AWAY FROM PICKING A RUNNING MATE
AFTER RALLIES IN SEVERAL BATTLEGROUND STATES. HETS BRING IN SOME OF MY
COLLEAGUES DASHA BURNS IS IN PENNSYLVANIA AHEAD OF TRUMP'S RALLY AND STEVE CORNEGY IS AT THE BIG BOARD WITH
MORE ON THE BATTLEGROUND IMPLICATIONS OF THE BATTLEGROUND AND CHUCK TODD IS HERE WITH ME
ON SET CHUCK TODD, I WANT YOUR REACTION TO THE CONFERENCE. DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP WA
TRYING TO GO IN THERE TO GET A RISE AND APPEAL TO HIS BASE?
>> THAT IS ALWAYS HIS DEFAULT. THIS IS HIS DEFAULT MODE YOU HAVE DEFAULT SETTINGS ON
ELECTRONICS AND THIS IS HI DEFAULT SETTING. I THINK HIS INTINCT WAS I' GOING TO GET INTO IT HERE.
I'M GOING TO SEE IF I CAN CREATE SOME TENSION IN THE ROOM I THINK HE THOUGHT -- I DON'
KNOW WHERE HE GOT THIS IDEA. I THINK HE THOUGHT SOMEHOW H COULD PLAY HER MIXED IDENTITY,
THAT HE COULD DO THIS. AND I HEARD FROM A BUNCH O
PEOPLE AS THIS WAS GOING ON AN REPUBLICANS AND SAYING WHY I
TRUMP HELPING DEMOCRATS. AND. >> THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE
LOVING THIS. >> RIGHT >> HAVING TO CATCH MYSELF. YES, THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN, THEY
WERE POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA ALMOST IMMEDIATELY >> MY INITIAL REACTION WAS THA
THE TWO PEOPLE RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN, IT HAS BROUGHT AS MUCH DISCIPLINE AS POSSIBLE AROUN
DONALD TRUMP THERE IS ALMOST SHOW MUCH YO CAN DO AS LONG AS YOU CAN KEEP HIM AWAY FROM UNSCRIPTED
MOMENTS. I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD OF A ON ON ONE DEBATE BETWEEN TRUMP AN
HARRIS IS JUST DRAMATICALLY, I YOU COULD WATCH THE STOC
MARKET, YOU WOULD SELL THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM, THERE IS NO GOOD THAT WILL COME OUT OF ONE ON ONE DEBATE WITH DONAL
TRUMP. HE HAS NEVER HANDLED BEING QUESTIONED BY AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WELL IT HAS ALWAYS GONE OFF THE RAILS
LIKE IT DID TODAY. >> AND CHUCK, REALLY QUICKLY CAN YOU ESTIMATE HOW MANY TIME IN THE LAST 8, 9 YEARS, THIS
DONALD TRUMP CAME INTO THE POLITICAL ARENA THAT WE KEEP SAYING, OH, THIS IS TOO FAR.
HE'S GONE TOO FAR. THE RACIAL IDENTITY QUESTION
TODAY OF ANY OTHER POLITICIAN, THIS SEEMED LIKE ONE OF THOS
MOMENTS. >> I TAKE YOUR POINT ON THAT BUT WHAT HE HAD IS IT'S A REMINDER
THAT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIS OW WORST ENEMY. HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN -- HE TOG
TALKS HIMSELF INTO PROBLEMS. IF HE JUST NO SHOWS TODAY, THA DOESN'T HAPPEN IF HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO ADMI
A MISTAKE, IF HE DID, HE WOULD HAVE HAD A SECOND TERM
WE CAN SAY IF ONLY HE WOULD DO THIS, IT DOZEN MATTER. IT'S NOT WHO HE IS
THIS IS WHO HE IS. TRUMP IS GOING TO TRUMP. THAT'S WHAT WE SAW TODAY
AND THIS WAS VINTAGE TRUMP HE CAN'T HELP HIMSELF. THIS IS WHY I HAVE SOM
SKEPTICISM WHETHER THE COUNTRY IS READY TO ELECT KAMALA HARRIS. BUT THE IDEA THAT THIS WOULD
MAKE HIM DISASSEMBLE IS ALWAYS WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A POTENTIAL
HERE THAT HE COULD LOSE THE RACE AN IT APPEARS HE IS LOSING. >> I WANT TO BRING IN DASH
BURNS IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE IN A COUPLE OF HOURS, THERE WILL BE A RALLY FOR DONALD TRUMP
YOU CAN SEE THE CROWD. HOW IS THE CAMPAIGN FEELIN ABOUT THE COMMENTS HE MADE ABOUT
HARRIS' HERITAGE THIS AFTERNOON? >> THEY ARE ALREADY ON DEFENSE
THERE ARE TWEETS FROM ALLIES AND ALSO TWEETING THIS GOES TO SHO THAT FAKE NEWS JOURNALISTS DON'T
CARE ABOUT INFLATION OR BORDER SECURITY OR IMPROVING OU SCHOOLS, ET CETERA, THEY JUS
CARE ABOUT GETTING TRUMP SO THEY ARE ON DEFENSE WE ARE OUT WITH A COMMENT FROM
THE CAMPAIGN OFFICIALLY. WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAYS ON TRUTH
SOCIAL THEY ARE LEANING INTO THIS AS COMBATIC ENVIRONMENT HE WENT INTO THIS IS HOW THE FORMER PRESIDENT
CHOSE TO HANDLE IT >> SO THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN,HOW DID IT FEEL ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS GETTING ALL OF THE
MEDIA ATTENTION FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS THE ECOSYSTEM HAS BEEN DOMINATED
BY HEADLINES ABOUT HER IS THIS A POSITION THAT TH TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS USED TO?
>> YOU AND I KNOW THAT THE
FORMER PRESIDENT DOESN'T LIKE IT WHEN HE IS NOT THE CENTER OF ATTENTION. SO MAYBE IT WAS A CHANCE TO GE
THE HEADLINES FOCUSED ON HIM FOR BETTER OR WORSE. THIS HAS BEEN A REAL CALIBRATION AND CHANGE IN DYNAMICES THAT
THEY HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH A NEW OPPONENT THAT HAS HAD DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP WITH TH
DEMOCRATIC BASE AND POTENTIALL WITH SOME OF THE VOTERS THAT ARE
STILL UNDECIDED. THEY ARE HAVING TO PIVOT THE STRATEGY IN REALTIME HERE. WE ARE WATCHING THAT PLAY OU
HERE >> DASHA BURNS, THANK YOU. I WANT TO BRING IN STEVE
KORNACKI VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS ARE MAKING SEVEN STOPS NEXT WEEK IN EACH OF
THE TOP BATTLEGROUND STATES. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOU THE PATH THAT THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN SEES TO GET TO TH
WHITE HOUSE? >> A COUPLE OF WAYS TO LOOK AT THIS WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THERE AR SIX CORE BATTLEGROUNDS
THEY SAY NORTH CAROLINA IS RIGHT IN THERE NORTH CAROLINA IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER
BATTLEGROUND STATES IN THIS WAY. ALL OF THE OTHER BATTLEGROUN STATES WENT BIDEN IN 2020 BU
NORTH CAROLINA WAS STILL A TRUMP STATE IF YOU LOOK AT IT THIS WAY
BEFORE HARRIS GOT IN THE RACE, BEFORE SHE GOT TO JOE BIDEN, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAS LOOKING
AT AN EXTREMELY NARROW PATH. YOU CAN SEE HARRIS' NAME BUT WHEN BIDEN WAS THE LIKEL
DEMOCRAT NOMINEE, THE BIDE FOLKS WERE SAYING THIS WOULD B
THEIR WALL, THEIR FORTRESS PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN WISCONSIN. AND IT WOULD JUST GET THEM T
270. BIDEN WAS STRUGGLING WIT NONWHITE VOTERS, HISPANIC VOTERS
AND LAGGING WITH BLACK VOTERS. SO THE SUN BELT STATES, TH POLLING WAS THE WORST FOR BIDE
THERE. WITH HARRIS THE LIKELY NOMINEE THE QUESTION IS DOES THAT STAR TO CHANGE. CAN SHE DO SOMETHING THAT WOUL
ALLOW HER NOT TO HAVE TO WIN ALL
THREE OF THE STATES HERE IF TRUMP WERE TO SWEEP ALL O
THESE, HE WOULD BE AT 268. HE WOULD JUST NEED ONE OF THES
STATES IN THE BIG TEN COUNTRY. WHAT IF HARRIS IS ABLE TO PICK OFF, POLLING IS SUGGESTING THA
SHE IS DOING BETTER WITH
HISPANIC VOTERS AND THERE IS A
SUBSTANTIAL HISPANIC POPULATIO IN GEORGIA IF SHE WERE TO LOSE MICHIGAN SHE COULD AFFORD IT. SO SHE CAN HOPEN UP MORE PATHS
IF SHE IS ABLE TO WIN ANY OF THESE STATES, IF SHE DOES, I TAKES THE PRESSURE OF THE STATES
HERE IN THE MIDWEST. DEMOCRATS SEE THE GROWTH
POTENTIAL RELATIVE TO BIDEN. THE GROWTH IS WITH NONWHIT VOTERS IN SUPPORT LEVEL AN
ENTHUSIASM LEVEL IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PLAY OUT, AND THAT IS A BIG IF RIGH
NOW, YOU WILL SEE IT MUCH MORE CLEARLY IN A GEORGIA, IN A
CAROLINA, IN AN ARIZONA, AND NEVADA THAN A STATE LIKE
WISCONSIN THAT IS 90% WHITE. SO CAN SHE MOVE THE BATTLEGROUND AROUND, CAN SHE OPEN UP TH
SOUTH AND NOT HAVE TO RELY O BIG 10 COUNTRY TRY >> A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION
RIGHT NOW OVER THE VP PICK I HOW THAT MAY CHANGE TH ELECTORAL MAP. WALK US THROUGH THAT IF YOU CAN.
ARIZONA VERSUS PENNSYLVANIA, GOVERNOR SHAPIRO VERSUS SENATO MARK KELLY OR EVEN GOVERNO
WALZ WHAT IS THE CALCULATION THAT THE HARRIS S CAMPAIGN IS MAKIN RIGHT NOW WITH REGARDS TO TH
VICE PRESIDENTIAL PICK >> IT IS REALLY INTERESTING,
RESETTING THIS HERE, WE HEAR I ALL THE TIME IT DOESN'T REALLY HAPPEN THA
MUCH THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES GO FOR THAT STRATEGY. AGAIN, RESETTING THE
BATTLEGROUND HERE. LET'S SAY HARRIS WERE TO PIC
JOSH SHAPIRO, PENNSYLVANIA 19ELECTORAL VOTES. IT ISSEST OF ANY BATTLEGROUN STATES AND IT WILL PUT HARRIS AT
245. AND IT WILL OPEN UP ALL SORTS OF POSSIBILITIES FOR US IF SHE HAS PENNSYLVANIA, JUS
GET MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN IF YOU HAVE PENNSYLVANIA IN YOUR POCKET AND YOU CAN SAY PICK OF
GEORGIA. NOW WITHIN 10, NOW ARIZONA WIL GET HER THERE. PENNSYLVANIA, BECAUSE IT IS SO
BIG IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL VOTES, YOU GET PENNSYLVANIA, AND YO
CAN LOSE BOTH BIG 10 STATES. BUT IF TRUMP WERE TO GET
PENNSYLVANIA AND HARRIS GO LET'S SAY WISCONSIN INSTEAD, SHE
IS SHORT OR IF SHE WERE TO GET MICHIGAN SHE'S SHORT. SO PENNSYLVANIA OF THE BIG 1
STATES IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. >> THE MULTITALENTED STEVE KORNACKI I UNDERSTAND YOU DO OLYMPI COVERAGE NOW TO.
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. >> CHUCK, WHAT WE JUST TALKE
ABOUT. DID THE ELECTORAL MAP JUST BLO UP FOR HARRIS? I REMEMBER THAT THE BIDE
CAMPAIGN WERE SAYING THEY COUL DO WELL IN NORTH CAROLINA AN PEOPLE WERE ROLLING THEIR EYES
>> WE ARE AT GENERIC DEMOCRATI NUMBERS NOW. I GET THERE IS A LOT O
ENTHUSIASM WHEN YOU ARE STARVING EVER CRACKER TASTES LIKE A RITZ AND NOW DEMOCRATS ARE IN THA
MODE WITH HARRIS FINALLY, WE HAVE A BIT OF CONSENSUS AND IT FEELS STRONG.
WHAT SHE HAS DONE, SHE HAS RISEN THE FLOOR TO GENERIC DEMOCRATI LEVELS
AND OF COURSE ALL SEVEN OF THE STATES ARE IN PLAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE RUNNING MATE, YOU SHOULDN'T THINK OF I
BY THIS BUT BY CONSTITUENC GROUP. ONE REASON TRUMP WAS OVERPERFORMING IN THE SOUTH AN BY BIDEN HAD A SHOT IN THE NORTH
IS THAT INFLATION IS HARDER IN THE SUNBELT BECAUSE PEOPLE WER LEAVING THERE. REAL ESTATE HAS GONE UP HIGHER
IN THE SUN BELT THAN IN TH NORTHERN CITIES. THAT IS WHY BIDEN HAD NOT BEEN
WIPED OUT YET BUT HE WAS PLAYING
FROM BEHIND. I STILL THINK THAT IS CHALLENGE FOR HER. TO ME, THE ONLY WAY YOU CA
ACTUALLY WIN THE STATES IS THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE ON THE SHORT LIST
THAT HAVE A MILITARY BACKGROUND. NORTH CAROLINA IN PARTICULAR HAS
A LOT OF MILITARY IN IT AND SO
DOES GEORGIA WITH A MILITARY BACKGROUND, IT NATURALLY FITS TOGETHER. SO IF YOU PLAY THE ONE STATE
STRATEGY WITH PENNSYLVANIA, DON'T KNOW WHERE JOSH SHAPIR
HELPS YOU ANYWHERE ELSE. BUT KELLY AND WALZ BECAUSE O THEIR MILITARY BACKGROUND, YOU
CAN'T WIN NORTH CAROLINA WITHOUT SOME PORTION OF THE WHITE VOTE AND THAT'S THE MILITARY VETERA
VOTE SO I THINK WALZ AND KELLY AR ARE ALSO ON THE SHORT LIST >> DO YOU THINK THIS IS CREA
AND SUGAR? >> THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL FALL WHAT I MEAN IS IT RAISED THE
FLOOR. SHE GOT THE GENERIC DEMOCRATIC VOTE BACK. AND NOW TRUMP IS HELPING HER
MORE >> ALL RIGHT, CHUCK TODD, CHIE POLITICAL ANALYST, SO GOOD T HAVE YOU WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THE
POLITICAL FALLOUT FROM TRUMP'S COMMENTS COMING UP >>> AND CRISIS IN THE MIDDLE
EAST, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S WARNING TO IRAN. AND THE FALLOUT AFTER TH
KILLING OF A TOP HAMAS OFFICIAL. WE WILL HAVE MORE FROM THE PENTAGON COMING UP NEXT. YOU'RE WATCHING MEET THE PRESS
NOW.
Hamas political leader killed in Iran escalates concerns of widening war
>>> WELCOME BACK THE U.S. AND THE MIDDLE EAST ARE ON EDGE AFTER TWO SENIOR LEADERS BACKED BY IRAN IN ACT OF
RESISTANCE WERE KILLED IN TH SPAN OF 24 HOURS IT IS AN ALARM BELL FOR
WIDENING WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. EARLIER THIS MORNING THE POLITICAL LEADER OF HAMAS WA
KILLED WHILE IN TEHRAN ACCORDING TO SOURCES IRAN IS BLAMING ISRAEL FOR THE
ATTACK AND VOWING RETALIATION. ISRAEL HAS NOT COMMENTED ON TH
STRIKE BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAID THAT ISRAEL HAD DEALT A CRUSHING BLOW AND WARNED OF CHALLENGING DAYS AHEAD AND SAID THAT ISRAEL I
PREPARED FOR ANY SCENARIO. SECRETARY OF STATE ANTON BLINKEN SAID THAT THE U.S. WAS NOT AWARE OF OR INVOLVED IN TH
DEATH. THE HAMAS LEADER WAS A KEY PLAYER IN THE CEASE FIRE TALKS
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS THIS COULD DERAIL NEGOTIATIONS TOSTOP THE FIGHTING AND ENSURE THE RELEASE OF REMAINING
HOSTAGES IN GAZA THE WHITE HOUSE ADDRESSE CONCERNS OF A SPIRALLING CONFLICT IN THE REGION
>> THE REPORTS OF THE LAST 24 TO 48 HOURS DON'T HELP WITH THE TEMPERATURE GOING DOWN
I'M NOT GOING TO BE POLLY ANNISH ABOUT IT WE ARE CONCERNED BUT THERE IS NO
SIGN THAT IT IS IMMINENT I ALSO SAID WE WILL WATCH IT VERY CLOSELY
>> JOINING ME NOW IS RAF SANCHEZ
AND KURT COURTNEY KUBE I WANT T TO TALK ABOUT THE STRIKE AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
FOR HAMAS LEADERSHIP >> WELL, AS YOU SAID, BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU IS REFUSING TO GIV DETAILS ON THE STRIKE, NOT SAYING ISRAEL IS RESPONSIBLE NOT DENYING THAT ISRAEL IS
RESPONSIBLE. THAT IS IN LINE WITH ISRAELI POLICY THEY OFTEN SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE HIGH STAKES COVERT OPERATION
THAT TAKE PLACE OVERSEAS A LOT OF WHAT WE KNOW IS COMIN
FROM IRANIAN STATE MEDIA 1:45 IRAN TIME, AN ISRAELI MISSILE HIT THE RESIDENCE OF THE
HANIYEH, THE POLITICAL CHIEF O HAMAS, KILLING HIM AND ONE O HIS BODY GUARDS, A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTER HE WAS MEETING WIT
IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER, ANOTHER ENEMY OF ISRAEL.
IN TERMS OF HAMAS'S LEADERSHIP ISRAEL SAID IT WOULD HUNT DOWN THE TOP LEADERS OF HAMAS AFTER
THE OCTOBER 7 ATTACK THEY HAVE KILLED THE POLITICAL CHIEF, HIS DEPUTY, THEY APPEAR TO HAVE KILLED THE HEAD OF THE
MILITARY WING IN A STRIKE IN GAZA EARLIER THIS MONTH.
THAT BASICALLY LEAVES SIN WA WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE IN THE
TUNNELS IN THE NEATH GAZA. AND WHILE HANIYEH WAS A CHIE
NEGOTIATOR, ISRAEL AND THE U.S HAVE SAID THAT IT IS SINWAR WH IS THE SEE DECISION MAKER FO
HAMAS. >> AND HOW ARE PEOPLE IN ISRAEL, PARTICULARLY THE HOSTAGE
FAMILIES, HOW ARE THEY REACTIN TO THIS? >> WE SPOKE EARLIER TO THE GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE OLDES
HOSTAGES STILL BEING HELD IN
GAZA 84-YEAR-OLD A. HIS GRANDFATHER SAID HE IS
DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT IT COULD DERAIL THE HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS.
HE IS APPEALING TO THE U.S. AN QATAR TO KEEP THE NEGOTIATIONS ON TRACK IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FO
ISRAEL AND HAMAS TO INDIRECTLY REENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS, GIVE THE SCALE OF THE LOSS ON THE
HAMAS SIDE WE HEARD FROM THE PRIME MINISTER
OF QATAR, BASICALLY TELLING US HOW ARE WE EXPECTED TO MEDIATE WHEN ONE SIDE OF THE NEGOTIATION
TABLE IS KILLING THE OTHER >> RAF SANCHEZ LIVE FOR US I TEL AVIV, THANK YOU
I WANT TO TURN TO COURTNEY KUBE. ANYTHING FROM THE OFFICIALS AT THE PENTAGON ON THE STRIKES? THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN SAYIN
IT BELIEVES THAT A WIDER WAR I INEVITABLE
ARE PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAYIN THE SAME THING >> THEY ARE. WE ARE GETTING THE SAME MESSAGE.
THEY STARTED A DIRECT ATTACK I GOLAN HEIGHTS THAT KILLED DOZEN CHILDREN
THE STRIKE OR WHATEVER IT WAS, THE KILLING OF HANIYEH I TEHRAN, WE ARE NOT GETTING A LOT
OF DETAIL. I KNOW RAF MENTIONED WHAT HAMA
AND IRAN ARE TELLING US BUT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW HE WAS KILLED WE DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL O
DETAIL BUT THE IDEA OF A LARGER ESCALATION, THE CONCERN IS BASED
ON THE IDEA THAT CREW THEY B INTERESTED IN GOING AFTER ISRAEL IN THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS
THEY COULD BE ATTACKED ON AL FRONTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MEDITERRANEAN.
FROM HEZBOLLAH TO THE NORTH AN THEY COULD HAVE STRIKES FROM
IRAN FROM THE WEST AND THE COULD TAKE STRIKES FROM TH
HOUTH HOUTHIS IN THE RED SEA YUR AREA THIS COULD BE A LARGER ATTACK.
IN ADDITION TO A LARGE RETALIATION OR RESPONSE, I ADDITION TO THAT, THERE IS A REAL CONCERN THAT THE FACT THA
THIS STRIKE OCCURRED INSID TEHRAN, A POLITICAL LEADER O HAMAS COULD BE A MAJOR POINT O
EMBARRASSMENT FOR IRAN FOR THAT REASON, WHATEVER TH RETALIATION IS, IT COULD BE MORE
ESCLATORY. HERE IN THE PENTAGON U.S OFFICIALS AND THROUGHOUT WASHINGTON D.C., OFFICIALS O
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ARE URGING CALM AND HOPING THIS DOES NOT ESCALATE BUT THIS IS A
POSSIBILITY. >> AND LOOK, NOTHING HAPPENS I A VACUUM WE ARE IN AN ELECTION YEAR IF VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WERE TO
WIN, THERE IS STILL SOME W DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER A
COMMANDER AND CHIEF. WHAT ARE NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS SAYING ABOUT HER NATIONAL POLICY? >> IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG
PROJECT. WE SPOKE TO ABOUT THREE DOZE OFFICIALS WHO WORKED WITH HER IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY AN
FOREIGN POLICY STATE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH OR SDERN ANY NATIONAL OR FOREIGN
POLICY THAT HARRIS HAS THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN BIDEN HER DETRACTORS WOULD SAY THAT IS
EVIDENCE SHE DOESN'T HAVE POLICY AT ALL. HER SUPPORTERS SAY SHE IS A VICE PRESIDENT AND HER ROLE IS TO
SUPPORT THE COMMANDER AND CHIE AND THAT'S WHAT SHE HAS BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS
WE ASKED ABOUT ANY POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES. THERE IS SOME BELIEF THAT SH MAY SHOW MORE EMPATHY WHEN I
COMES TO THINGS LIKE GAZA, HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS, WIT WOMEN AND CHILDREN BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PUBLI
COMMENTS, IT IS NOT REFLECTED. HER TONE AND EMPHASIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THE OVERALL MESSAGE TRACKS WIT
PRESIDENT BIDEN. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEARN MOR ABOUT HOW SHE ACTS IN SOME O
THESE MEETINGS EVERYTHING FROM THE WITHDRAWAL OF AFGHAN TAN TO THE WAR I
UKRAINE AND THE MANY NATIONA SECURITY ISSUES THAT HAVE COME
UP SINCE THEN. AND SHE HAS POINTED AND DIRECTED QUESTIONS THAT TEND TO OPEN TH
8 BALL >> COURTNEY KUBE LIVE FOR US A THE PENTAGON, THANK YOU. >>> FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR AT THE
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT FOR THE MIDDLE EAST REGION IS JOINING US NOW, HEAD AT TRENT RESEARCH AN
ADVISORY, THANK YOU FOR JOININ US PUT TOGETHER WHAT DO THESE
DEVELOPMENTS MEAN FOR TH REGION ARE THE PROSPECTS OF A REGIONA
WAR GREATER TODAY? >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU I THINK THE PAST WEEKS AND MONTHS ALL POINT TO STRIKING
PARADOX IN THE REGION WHICH IS WE ARE INCHING CLOSER TO AN AL
OUT WAR BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE IRAN P LED AXIS EVEN THOUGH
BELIEVE IT IS AN UNLIKELY WA BECAUSE NEITHER SIDE WANTS IT. SO THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD
ISRAEL CONDUCT SUCH ATTACK
WHICH CANNOT BE VIEWED BUT A PROVOCATIVE.
THE ISRAELS BELIEVE THE IRANIANS ARE NOT DETERRED FROM LAUNCHIN AN ALL OUT WAR, THE SAME WAY
THAT THE IRANIANS BELIEVE THAT ISRAEL IS DETERRED FROM AN ALL
OUT WAR. THERE IS ROOM FOR MISCALCULATION AND ACCIDENTS WHICH YOU SAW WITH
THE ATTACK OF HEZBOLLAH. IT IS A FOR TAT THAT
CONTINUES. WE ARE EDGING CLOSER TO WAR BU
NEITHER SIDE WANTS IT. >> ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT ISRAEL
WOULD TAKE OUT HAMAS'S POLITICAL LEADER AT THE SAME TIME TH CEASE FIRE NEGOTIATIONS AR
UNDERWAY DOESN'T THAT UNDERMINE OR DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? >> ON ONE HAND, IT DOESN'T
FRANKLY. IT GOES BACK TO WHAT THE GOAL OF THE ISRAELIS IS. THEY HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE
GOAL IS TOTAL VICTORY. THAT MEANS YOU DECAPITATE TH LEADERSHIP OF HAMAS AND GO AFTER
MILITARY CAPACITY AND DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO CRUSH TH
ORGANIZATION THEY ARE SAYING THIS IS CRUSHING BLOW. I BEG TO DIFFER.
I DON'T THINK IT HURTS HAMAS THAT MUCH. HE DOESN'T REALLY CALL THE SHOTS IN GAZA.
IT IS SINWAR WHO CALLS THE SHOTS. THIS IS A GUY WHO WAS INVOLVED
IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ISRAELIS, TO THE QATARI PROCESS. SO YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE
DAY, YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT I YOUR OBJECTIVE HERE?
IS IT TO REACH A CEASE FIRE OR DECIMATE HAMAS YOU CAN'T DO BOTH.
>> SO WHO WOULD FILL THE LEADERSHIP ROLE AND BE THE
NEGOTIATOR IFSINWAR IS CALLING THE SHOTS? >> YOEPG WE KNOW I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS
THEY WILL FIND ANOTHER POLITICAL NEGOTIATOR WHETHER OUTSIDE O GAZA OR INSIDE GAZA.
IT DOESN'T MATTER. THE GUY WHO HAS INFLUENCE OVER
THE PROCESS IS SINWAR. HE SEEMS TO HAVE MELLOWED LITTLE WITH THE DEMANDS HE HAD
BEFORE BUT WITH THIS ATTACK, THIS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUP
AND DELAY NEGOTIATIONS >> SO WILL THIS CHANGE THE ADMINISTRATION 'S CALCULUS O STRATEGY WHEN IT COMES TO TH
MIDDLE EAST? DOES THE FOCUS S BECOME LESS O GAZA NOW AND MORE ON IRAN?
>> POSSIBLY BUT AT THE END O THE DAY, YOU HAD AN ISRAEL
PRIME MINISTER WHO I RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THESE I
THE MIDDLE EAST AND NOT LOWERING THE TEMPERATURE AND NOT GOING TO A CEASE FIRE HE CAME TO WASHINGTON AND HAD
STANDING OVATION SO WE ARE NOT GETTING OUR OW OBJECTIVES IN THE MIDDLE EAS NOW. WE HAVE YET TO COMMUNICATE CLEAR
AND SIGNIFICANT RED LINES TO THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER IN TERM OF LIMIT OF SUPPORT FOR AN
CONTINUATION OF THE ATTACKS HE IS WAGING. SO YES, ARE WE GOING TO SHIF
THE ATTENTION TO PREVENTING LARGE SCALE CONFRONTATION? YES, THAT'S WHAT WE DID WHEN THE
IRANIANS AND ISRAELIS ENGAGED IN AN IT FOR TAT. BUT WE ARE FOCUSED ON A CEAS
FIRE EXCEPT WITH THE LATES ATTACKS, WE ARE FAR AWAY >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US WE APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERTISE >>> WE DIVE DEEPER INTO TH STATE OF THE 2024 CAMPAIGN AND FEARS OF A WIDENING CONFLICT I
THE MIDDLE EAST WITH MICHAEL BENNETT. YOU'RE WATCHING MEET THE PRESS NOW. STAY WITH US
>>> CLOSER TO THE GAZA BORDER. >> STORIES OF RESILIENCE AND HOPE >> PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSEL AND EACH OTHER
One-on-one with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO)
>>> WELCOME BACK THE WHITE HOUSE IS GRAPPLING WITH ESCALATING TENSIONS IN TH MIDDLE EAST FOLLOWING THE DEAT
OF TWO MILITARY LEADERS IN IRAN.
AND NATIONAL SECURIT COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR JOH KIRBY SAYS THEY HAVE NOT HAD DIRECT OR INDIRECT CONVERSATIONS
WITH IRAN IN THE AFTERMATH O THE STRIKES. JOINING ME NOW IS DEMOCRATIC
SENATOR FROM COLORADO, MICHAEL BENNETT. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
I WANT TO GETD GET YOU REACTIONS TO THE MIDDLE EAST HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU THAT THI
ESCALATES TENSIONS IN THE REGION AND PUTS AN END TO THE CEASE FIRE NEGOTIATIONS? >> I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOU
IT I THINK WE ALL SHOULD BE DEEPL CONCERNED ABOUT IT THERE IS A MOMENT IN WHICH THE
ESCALATIONS BEGIN TO FEE POSSIBLE AND A WIDER WAR COULD BECOME INEVITABLE. WE HAVE TO TRY NOT TO ALLOW THAT
TO HAPPEN. I THINK THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION
IS OBVIOUSLY DEEPLY INVOLVED I PEACE NEGOTIATIONS HERE. I THINK THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO
TRY TO PUSH EVEN WHEN TH
DOMESTIC POLITICS OF THE PARTIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST SEEM TO B
POTENTIALLY PUSHING THEM APART IN THE END, I THINK THE ONLY HOPE HERE IS FOR TWO STATES THAT
ARE LIVING SIDE BY SIDE. WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM THA HAPPENING. BUT I THINK THE UNITED STATE
HAS A ROLE TO PLAY TO TRY TO KEEP IT FROM BECOMING A GREATE
REGIONAL CONFLICT. I'M GLAD THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOLKS ARE TRYIN TO DO THAT >> YOU MET WITH SOME AMERICA
CONGRESS MEMBERS WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM NOW? >> WHAT THEY SAID TO ME IS THA THEY WERE DESPERATE FOR TH
HOSTAGES TO COME HOME, THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE A SETTLEMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW THE HOSTAGES TO COME
HOME I THINK THAT IS TRUE TODAY WE SHOULD BE PUSHING FOR THAT.
>> IF THE DEMOCRATS WIN TH WHITE HOUSE IN NOVEMBER, WHA ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF VICE
PRESIDENT HARRIS' FOREIG POLICY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HER FOREIG POLICY RESUME? >> I THINK WE WERE MEMBERS
TOGETHER ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE.
I THINK SHE HAS GOOD FOREIGN POLICY AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS A RECORD OF
LEADERSHIP, ESPECIALLY WIT RESPECT TO THE MOBILIZATION OF THE EUROPEAN NATIONS AND NATIONS ALL AROUND THE WORLD IN TH
FIGHT AGAINST PUTIN THAT UKRAINE HAS LED. IT IS NOT JUST A FIGHT FOR
UKRAINE BUT A FIGHT FO DEMOCRACY. JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN A HUGE PART OF THAT AND HARRIS WILL STEP
RIGHT INTO THE SHOES AS OPPOSE TO THE RECKLESSNESS OF DONAL TRUMP WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT AN
THE DOWN RIGHT INSANITY OF J VANCE WHEN IT COMES TO HIS
ISOLATIONIST POSITION. KAMALA HARRIS WOULD BE TAKING UP
A MUCH MORE NORMAL APPROACH TO OUR FOREIGN POLICY THAN THE ON THAT TRUMP AND VANCE WOULD B
ESPOUSING. >> AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT DOMESTIC POLITICS YOU WERE ONE OF THE FIRS
DEMOCRATS TO EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT KEEPING PRESIDENT BIDEN ON THE TICKET ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THE LEVEL
OF ENTHUSIASM WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE VP >> WELL, I THINK IT IS
INCREDIBLE I I THINK IT IS WONDERFUL. I THINK JOE BIDEN'S DECISION H
MADE IS INCREDIBLY PAITIC AN PUTS THE COUNTRY AHEAD OF JO BIDEN. NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE
NEXT FOUR MONTHS COUNT SO IT IS DEBATABLE WE HAVE TO SHOW UP BETWEEN NOW
AND ELECTION DAY AND MAKE SURE
WE ELECT A DEMOCRAT WHITE HOUSE, SENATE AND HOUSE IT WILL NOT HAPPEN BY ITSELF
WE WILL HAVE TO KNOCK ON DOORS AND GET PEOPLE OUT AND MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THE STAKES WHEN YOU SEE A FORMER PRESIDEN
OF THE UNITED STATES DO WHAT THIS PRESIDENT DID IN CHICAGO,
IF PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE A REASON TO MAKE SURE WE ARE IN THE
ELECTION, YOU NOW UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES REALLY
ARE. >> SENATOR, YOU MENTIONED TH IMPACT ON DOWN BALLOT RACES.
WHAT RACE SPECIFICALLY DO YO THINK SHE WILL IMPACT? >> I THINK SHE ALREADY HAS
I CONCERNS ARTICULATED EARLY O IS THAT I THOUGHT WE WOULD B WIPED OUT IN THE HOUSE AND
SENATE EVEN TODAY, OUR ODDS OF WINNIN THE HOUSE ARE VASTLY IMPROVE
BEFORE THE VICE PRESIDENT TOOK UP THE MANTLE. AND I THINK OUR ODDS IN TH
SENATE TODAY ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE. PART OF THAT IS THE GENERATIONAL
DIFFERENCE THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT REPRESENTS AND A HUGE PART OF IT IS THE EXCITEMENT ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE,
ALL OVER COLORADO, ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY WHO FEEL LIKE THEY NOW HAVE A REASON TO VOTE. I THINK THEY HAD A REASON TO
VOTE BEFORE. BUT THAT IS NOT AS IMPORTANT NOW THEY FEEL THEY HAVE A REASON TO VOTE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERYON
DOES VOTE. >> AND THE CAMPAIGN SAYS SHE WILL BE OUT IN BATTLEGROUN STATES WITH HER VP PICK NEXT
WEEK YOU TOLD US THAT SHE IS THE BEST
CHOICE >> WELL, I STILL LOVE MARK KELLY, I THINK SHE WILL MAKE A
EXCELLENT CHOICE AND SHE DOESN'T NEED ME TO INTERFERE WITH THAT
DECISION >> WITH REGARDS TO MARK KELLY, TRUMP HAS GONE ALL IN ATTACKIN HER RECORD ON THE BORDER YESTERDAY AT A RALLY IN ATLANTA,
THE VICE PRESIDENT CAME OU EARLY TRYING TO COUNTER TH
NARRATIVE. CAN HE HELP ON THAT ISSUE? >> I THINK HE CAN HELP A LOT O
THAT ISSUE HE IS OBVIOUSLY FROM A BORDE STATE. BUT LISTEN, THE REALITY IS THE
REPUBLICANS WALKED AWAY FROM THE IMMIGRATION BILL BECAUSE DONAL TRUMP WANTED TO KEEP IT AS A
CAMPAIGN ISSUE THAT IS NO SECRET TO EVERYONE. WHAT IS LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME. WE STARTED WITH A GANG OF TEN, WHO WROTE THE LAST COMPREHENSIVE
IMMIGRATION BILL WITH 68 VOTES AND WHO KILLED IT? THE FREEDOM CAUCUS IN THE HOUS KILLED IT. THEY DON'T WANT TO SOLVE THE
ISSUE. THEY JUST WANT TO CAMPAIGN O THE ISSUE, WHETHER IT IS 8 YEARS
AGO, 10 YEARS AGO, WHEN WE WER NEGOTIATING OVER UKRAINE AID THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO DEAL WITH
THIS AND WE NEED TO DEAL WIT
THIS LIKE PASSING CITIZENSHI FOR 11 MILLION PEOPLE, THE DREAM ACT AND VISA BILLS THAT ARE SO
IMPORTANT TO OUR AGRICULTURA SECTOR AND I THINK THAT WE CAN DO IT, YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WITH TH
RIGHT LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON WE CAN DO. >> WE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE I THERE, SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME
>>> AFTER THE BREAK, WE LOOK A LATINO VOTERS IN A STATE THA
COULD DECIDE WHO LEADS THE WHITE HOUSE THIS FALL. YOU'RE WATCHING MEET THE PRESS NOW.

POSITIVE THING >> Reporter: LOPEZ RECALLS HARRIS'S TRIP BUT HAS NOT BEEN SWAYED YET >> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. >> Reporter: WITH LESS THAN 10
DAYS TO THE ELECTION, TH RESIDENTS ARE PAYING ATTENTION AND FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE DECISION AHEAD >> THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT FOR
THE COUNTRY, WHAT YOU WANT FOR THE KIDS >> I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO SAY, WOW, THINGS ARE DIFFERENT
NOW THAN THEY WERE FOR MOM AND DAD. AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT WE ARE I
THIS COUNTRY >> WE THANK GEORGIA SOLIS FO THAT REPORT. >>> COMING UP, EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH JD VANCE, WHA
THE REPUBLICAN VP NOMINEE HAD TO SAY ABOUT HIS ROLLOUT AT TRUMP'S
Panel: Trump clashes with Black journalists during interview
>>> WELCOME BACK LET'S GET TO OUR PANEL
FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO VIC PRESIDENT HARRIS AND COHOST OF
THE WEEKEND ON MSNBS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US I WANT TO START WITH SIMONE.
>> OH, NO. >> THE REASON I WANT T TO STAR WITH SIMONE IS I WANT TO KNO WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD
THIS AFTERNOON WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS SPEAKING IN FRONT OF THE REPORTERS AT THE CONFERENCE.
>> FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THERE WAS TWO THINGS, THERE IS THE PROCESS OF HOW IT CAME TOGETHE
AND THE ORGANIZATION SHOULD HAVE HANDLED THINGS VERSUS WHAT T W ENDED UP SEEING AND WHAT WE NO
KNOW >> THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE WH SAID THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN
DONALD TRUMP A PLATFORM. >> SOME SAID THEY SHOULD NOT WEIGH INTO THE ISSUES.
BUT THEY HAD ISSUED INVITATION
TO OTHER CANDIDATES. THERE IS THAT PIECE. BUT THERE IS THE PIECE THAT I' GLAD PEOPLE ARE SEEING THIS.
THE CLIPS WILL BE PLAYED OVE AND OVER AGAIN ON CABLE NEWS AND THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED
TO TRUMP WAS BEING DEPLATFORMED. HE WAS INCITING VIOLENCE IN MY
PERSONAL OPINION HE WAS REMOVED FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES, AND A FRACTION OF THE FOLLOWING THAT HE HAD ON
TWITTER. FOLKS WERE NOT COVERING TH RALLIES, THE THINGS HE SAID.
THEY WERE DESENSITIZED AND THE ELECTORATE, THAT'S WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM. I THINK THE BEST THING THA
COULD HAVE HAPPENED AND COUL HAPPEN GOING FORWARD IS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS PAID ATTENTION
BY SERIOUS JOURNALISTS >> AND RACHEL SCOTT, KUDOS T HER. >> KUDOS TO HER WHO HAD THENER
VIEW ON HER BACK >> JEFF, I WANT TO TURN TO YOU I WAS SPEAKING WITH A COUPLE O
BIDEN ADVISORS AND BESIDES CALLING THIS REPULSIVE, THIS I WHAT THEY WANT IN THE SENSE THAT
NOW THEY ARE SEEING THIS O SOCIAL MEDIA, CLIPS OF THIS.
AS SYMONE SAID, VOTERS NEED TO SEE DONALD TRUMP FOR WHO HE IS HOW MUCH DO YOU EXPECT THE
INTERVIEW OF THIS AFTERNOON WILL PLAY FOR THE CAMPAIGN? >> I THINK IT WILL BE ALL OVER IT WILL BE ALL OVER SOCIAL
MEDIA, ALL OVER THE AIR WAVES. IT WILL BE IN PEOPLE'S STORIES
I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT. THIS IS THE CONTRACT THEY WANTED TO MAKE FOR MONTHS ALL OF THE FOCUS S WAS O
BIDEN'S AGE AND THEY BELIEVE UNFAIRLY NOW THAT IS REMOVED BECAUSE HE IS NO LONGER A CANDIDATE AND H
HAS KAMALA HARRIS REALLY ROCKING IT WITH HER PARE AND ROCKING I IN TERMS OF FUNDRAISING AN
ENERGY AND THEN YOU PUT TH FORMER PRESIDENT OUT THERE AND HE SAYS THINGS LIKE THAT, YO
DON'T EVEN HAVE TO DRAW TH CONTRAST IT IS THERE. >> WASN'T THE CONTRUST ALWAY
THERE? >> YES, I THINK THAT IS A FAIR QUESTION >> DO VOTERS CARE? IS ANYONE LOOKING AT THIS SAYING
OH, I'M SO UPSET DONALD TRUM SAID THIS. HIS BASE DOESN'T CARE. >> LET'S THINK WHO IT MATTER
TO BLACK VOTERS, CERTAINLY. AND THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAD MADE INROADS WITH BLACK MEN. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE HARRIS
S CAMPAIGN IS AWARE OF EVERYTHING THAT MOTIVATES OR DOESN'T MOTIVATE INDEPENDENT
VOTERS, PEOPLE ON THE LINE THINKING IS THIS SOMEONE I WAN TO VOTE FOR OR NOT, WHEN YOU GET
COMMENTS LIKE THAT, IT COULD
MOVE THE BALANCE >> SHOULD THEY HAVE AGREED T THIS INTERVIEW >> OOFK HE KNEW.
HE IS WHERE HE WANTS TO BE RIGHT NOW. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IN THE
DISCUSSION HE WANTS TO BE THE CENTER OF ATTENTION. AND I GIVE HIM PROPS FOR SHOWING
UP ONE OF THE SUCCESSES HE HAS HA UNLIKE OR PEOPLE IS HE HAS N
PROBLEM WITH THEADACITY TO SHO UP AND CAMPAIGN IN AREAS THA ARE NOT REPUBLICAN
WILL IT CHANGE THINGS? WE ARE HAVING A BIG DISCUSSION HERE BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL
>> LET ME JUST SAY THIS POIN ABOUT VOTERS AND REGULAR PEOPLE. THIS IS WHY I THINK PEOPLE
SEEING DONALD TRUMP UNFETTERED IS IMPORTANT IF I'M OUT THERE TALKING T PEOPLE ACROSS THE CONTRY
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU SAY TRUMP SAID X, Y, Z, THEY SAY, HE DIDN'T SAY THAT OR HE WA
JOKING, HE DIDN'T MEAN IT. SO IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TRUMP
SAYING TO PUT BLEACH IN YOU TO CURE COVID, THEY WOULD NOT
BELIEVE IT >> THEY STILL DON'T T BELIEV IT >> AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT
TO HEAR HIM. HE SOUNDED A LITTLE UNHINGED AND
SLIGHTLY RACIST. >> HAS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DONE ENOUGH OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS TO SWITCH UP THE PLAYBOOK OR AR
THEY RUNNING THE SAME PLAYBOOK AS AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN >> FIRST OFF, KAMALA HARRIS HA
PROVIDED A POLL BUMP FOR THE DEMOCRATS. I THINK THAT IS OBVIOUS. I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE
SHE WAS THE VICE PRESIDENTIA DOMNEY AND SHE WILL GO TO TH
DNC. AFTER THAT, HER RECORD, WHAT SHE HAS SUPPORTED, WHETHER IT IS ELIMINATING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS WE KNOW IT, BANNIN
FRACKING, THE BORDER, ALL OF THOSE ISSUES WILL COME TO TH FOREFRONT AND THAT IS WHAT
VOTERS ARE ARE LOOKING AT AN MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHO THE WANT TO HEED THE COUNTRY SHE WAS THE NUMBER TWO TO JO
BIDEN. THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND I EXPECT THE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT BECAUSE
IT IS EFFECTIVE. WHETHER YOU WANT TO ARGUE ABOU HER BEING THE BORDER ZAER OR NOT, SHE WAS OVER THE BORDER I
THE COUNTRY. >> IT WAS THE ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRATION BUT NO ONE HEARD ME.
>> LET'S TURN TO SENATOR J VANCE AND THE VP PICK. I WANT TO PUT UP A QUOTE FRO
WHAT HE TOLD HENRY GOMEZ HE SAID THE PRICE OF ENTRY O BEING ON A NATIONAL TICKET AND
GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO GOVERN IS YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE SHOTS SO I SORT OF EXPECTED IT
IN THE SAME INTERVIEW, H DOUBLED DOWN ON THE CHILDLES DEMOCRATS COMMENTS
IS HE GETTING IN HIS OWN WAY AND HOW AWKWARD IS IT TO SEE TRUMP
TRY TO DEFEND HIM BUT NO REALLY THAT IS NOT A POSITION THA TRUMP WANTS TO BE IN
>> I CAN GUARANTEE YOU WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT THAT IT'S NOT THE PLACE HE WANTS
TO BE, SPENDING TIME NOW AND SPENDING INTERVIEWS ON QUESTIONS AND WHATEVER ON DEFENDING HIS VP
CHOICE AND I KNOW WE WILL GO BACK AND QUESTION THE DECISIONS THE REPORTING SHOWS HE IS DOIN
THAT NOW CAN VANCE GET A SECOND TRY SURE CAN HE CLEAN UP SOME OF TH
THINGS THERE WILL BE QUOTES FRO
HARRIS'S PAST COMING UP. IT DOESN'T DEFINE EVERYTHING >> YOU HAVE BEEN TO MANY O
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S RALLIES. HOW DID THE RALLY IN ATLANTA HOW DID THAT -- WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF IT
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOU ENERGY AND THE ENERGY IS COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT. THAT IS THE TECHNIQUE. >> ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE ON THE PANEL.
WE APPRECIATE IT WE ARE HERE AT THE END OF TH HOUR
WE WILL HAVE MORE TOMORROW
