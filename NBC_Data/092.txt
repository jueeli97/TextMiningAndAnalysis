BEGINNING TO DWINDLE DOWN. NORTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR ROY
COOPER HAS INFORMED THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN DOES NOT WANT TO BE CONSIDERED FOR THE VP ROLE. THE MICHIGAN GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER SAYS SHE'S NOT PART OF THE VETTING PROCESS.
>> I HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH EVERYONE INCLUDING THE CAMPAIGN THAT I MADE A COMMITMENT TO SERVE OUT MY TERM AS GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN I CAN BE AN
EXCELLENT ALLY TO PRESIDENT
HARRIS AND A GREAT COCHAIR OF THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN FROM MY PLACE AS GOVERNOR SO I'M NOT PART OF THE VETTING. >> AS OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS ASKED
TO CLARIFY COMMENTS HE MADE AT A RALLY LAST WEEK WHEN HE TOLD SUPPORTERS THEY WON'T HAVE TO VOTE ANYMORE IF HE WINS IN NOVEMBER.
IN AN INTERVIEW WITH FOX NEWS, MR. TRUMP CLAIMING CHRISTIANS ARE NOT KNOWN TO BE A LARGE PART IN GROUP.
A SPOKESPERSON PRETTILY TOLD NBC THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FAITH. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE INCLUDING MORE ON THAT NARROWING PULL A
PROSPECTIVE RUNNING MATES FOR VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS SO LET'S BEGIN WITH BRIE JACKSON FROM WASHINGTON WITH THE LATEST ON THE CAMPAIGN. GOOD MORNING.
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. SEVERAL VICE PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS ARE HITTING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL SEEKING TO DRAW A STARCH CRIME JUST BETWEEN FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
AND VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS . MEANWHILE ONE POTENTIAL BP PICK HAS WITHDRAWN FROM THE FIELD.
VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IS LIST OF POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES NARROWING. NORTH CAROLINA
GOVERNOR ROY COOPER PULLING HIS NAME OUT OF CONSIDERATION MONDAY WHILE PRESIDENT BIDEN REMAINS TIGHTLIPPED ABOUT THE DECISION.
THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO VOICE SUPPORT FOR HARRIS'S PRESIDENTIAL BID TOUTING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THEY MADE TOGETHER IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> I MADE CLEAR HOW WE FEEL ABOUT KAMALA. SHE IS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE PARTNER TO ME AND CHIPPING AS CIVIL RIGHTS THROUGHOUT HER CAREER. >> Reporter: FORMER PRESIDENT
TRUMP IS CRITICIZED HARRIS ON IMMIGRATION AND A RECORD ON CRIME. >> SHE WAS A BAD PROSECUTOR.
SHE WAS A PROSECUTOR OF BLACK PEOPLE. >> Reporter: THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL ATTEND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS CONVENTION WEDNESDAY AS HE SEEKS TO CONNECT WITH BLACK VOTERS.
>> DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT.
WE WERE DOING BETTER FINANCIALLY. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A BUSINESS ICON SO WHY WOULD WE NOT WANT THAT BUSINESS ICON TO BE PRESIDENT? >> Reporter: HARRIS IS BUILDING
MOMENTUM AND ENERGIZING THE DEMOCRATIC BASE. >> I THINK THERE IS ELECTRIC ENERGY. >> THE TIDES OF TURNED AND I'M EXCITED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A
LONG TIME ON HOW THE ELECTION
IS GOING. >> Reporter: LESS THAN 100 DAYS UNTIL VOTERS HEAD TO THE POLLS. AND THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS EXPECTED TO CHOOSE A RUNNING MATE BY AUGUST 7. WE ARE
KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THAT. >> LOTS OF CHANGES. THANK YOU. LET'S BRING IN OUR CAMPAIGN IN
BED. GOOD MORNING.
AND LET'S START WITH GOVERNOR ROY COOPER OF NORTH CAROLINA REPORTEDLY BACKING OUT OF CONSIDERATION TO BE RUNNING MATE
TO HARRIS. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT DECISION AND WHY HE ANNOUNCED IT? >> Reporter: THAT'S A DECISION
WE HEARD LAST NIGHT FROM THE GOVERNOR WHO WAS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE FRONT RUNNERS IN THE RACE FOR VP. WE DID THAT NBC NEWS ANALYSIS
OF THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS AND HE WAS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST BUT THEY DO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP BUT
COOPER SAID IN A STATEMENT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME FOR HIM TO LEAVE NORTH CAROLINA AS FOR
REASONS WHY, THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS. WE'VE HEARD THERE'S A QUIRK IN NORTH CAROLINA STATE LAW THAT
MEANS IF HE LEFT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MAY BE ABLE TO RISE TO THE TOP SPOT IN THE WORK CONCERNS ABOUT HIM TAKING OVER.
THERE OTHER REPORTS THAT SAY COOPER WASN'T ALL THAT
INTERESTED BECAUSE OF A POSSIBLE FUTURE SENATE RUN. ONE THING THAT IS CLEAR IS COOPER SAID HE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR HARRISON DO WHAT HE CAN TO GET HER ELECTED.
WITH NO EVIDENCE OF THAT LAST NIGHT. HE DID JOIN WHITE DUDES FOR HARRIS ZOOM CALL THAT HAD A HIGH NUMBER OF HIGH-PROFILE
SURROGATES AND CELEBRITIES THAT WAS ABLE TO RAISE MORE THAN $3 MILLION TO IS USING HIS NAME POWER TO HELP THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN. >> THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE
CALL. WHITE DUDES FOR HARRIS. THAT'S NOT A MISTAKE. >> AND WE KNOW THAT THE MICHIGAN GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER TELLING MORNING JOE
THAT SHE'S NOT CONSIDERED OR IN THE VETTING PROCESS RIGHT NOW.
WE KNOW THAT SHE'S TAKING PART IN THAT RALLY WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO AND SUPPORTING HARRIS AND PENNSYLVANIA HOPE PUSH
BIDEN OVER THE TOP IN 2020 SO IS GOVERNOR SUPERHERO CONSIDERED THE FRONT RUNNER?
>> WELL, CERTAINLY HE IS CONSIDERED AMONG THE LEADING FRONT RUNNERS RIGHT NOW LIKE YOU MENTIONED.
PENNSYLVANIA IS A TOP BATTLEGROUND AND ONE CRUCIAL FOR THE PATH TO VICTORY FOR THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN AND HE IS A VERY POPULAR GOVERNOR. HE WAS WITH WITMER OVER THE
WEEKEND AND TURNED OUT ABOUT 1000 PEOPLE TO A CAMPAIGN RALLY FOR HARRIS, MANY TOLD OUR REPORTERS THEY WERE INTRIGUED BY THE IDEA OF HIM SERVING ALONGSIDE HARRIS.
HE IS UP THERE BUT WE DO NOTE THERE ARE OTHER NAMES IN ACTIVE CONSIDERATION. MARK PELLEY IN ARIZONA IS
CONSIDERED A TOP PROSPECT AND THERE ARE NEWER FACES IN THE VETTING PROCESS.
EVEN GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER FROM ILLINOIS. I SPOKE TO SOME OFFICIALS TO SAY UNTIL THE AUGUST 7 DEADLINE, NAMES ARE STILL BEING CONSIDERED AND WE MAY NOT KNOW
UNTIL A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE. >> I CAN IMAGINE WAITING FOR THAT CALL AND HOW IMPORTANT
PENNSYLVANIA IS IN THIS PROCESS. BUT NOT JUST PENNSYLVANIA.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT KENTUCKY. I'VE BEEN SURPRISED THAT GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR HAS NOT HAD MORE ATTENTION IN THE VEEPSTAKES. HE HAS BEEN MENTIONED BUT WE HAVE THIS NEW REPORTING ABOUT
HIS BEING SCRUTINIZED FOR HIS ABORTION RECORD IN THE STATE. OF COURSE THAT STATE, ONE BY
DONALD TRUMP ARE MORE THAN 20 POINTS. WALK US THROUGH THESE CRITICISMS OF THE SHEER. >> Reporter: GOVERNOR ANDY
BESHEAR HAS EMERGED AS ANOTHER VICE PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER, LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE IS IN A REDSTART THAT DONALD TRUMP IS POPULAR AND IS BEEN
ELECTED TWICE NOW BUT LARGER MARGINS IN EACH RACE. YOU SEE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING SOMEONE LIKE BESHEAR . OVER THE
WEEKEND THE CAMPAIGN HAD HIM GO TO FORSYTH COUNTY , WHICH IS THE
REPUBLICAN, PREDOMINANTLY WHITE AREA AND HE WAS ABLE TO TURN OUT HUNDREDS OF VOTERS AND ADVOCATE ON HALF OF THE CAMPAIGN BUT THERE WERE REPORTS THERE
WERE THOSE IN HIS STATE THAT THOUGH HE DID NOT DO ENOUGH AS GOVERNOR TO FIGHT STATE RESTRICTIONS ON ABORTION, HIS RUNNING MATE IS SOMEONE WHO WAS
A DEMOCRAT AND DESCRIBES HERSELF AS A PRO-LIFE DEMOCRAT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND CONCERTS EVEN IN HIS OWN RE-
ELECTION CAMPAIGN HE WAS FICKLE WITH HOW MUCH YOU WANTED TO LEAN INTO THE PRO-ABORTION MESSAGING. I ASKED COOPER ABOUT THESE CONCERNS WHEN HE WAS IN FORSYTH COUNTY.
LISTEN TO HOW HE DEFENDED HIMSELF AGAINST THIS ATTACK. >> I AM THE FIRST DEMOCRAT IN
KENTUCKY THAT HAS EVER RUN AN ABORTION AT DURING AN ELECTION. I VETOED FIVE SEPARATE ANTI- CHOICE BILLS I STOOD UP EVERY
SINGLE TIME KNOWING IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE ATTACKS ON ME. I THINK I'VE BEEN AS STRONG AS ANYBODY OUT THERE ON CHOICE. IT'S A LOT HARDER IN KENTUCKY
TO DO IT AND I STILL STOOD UP AND DONE IT EVERY TIME. >> Reporter: SO THAT'S HOW YOU
HEAR THE GOVERNOR HIMSELF DEFEND HIS RECORD ON ABORTION BUT THIS IS A CAMPAIGN OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND IT WILL BE A HUGE ISSUE AND ONE VICE
PRESIDENT HARRIS HAS BEEN VOCAL ABOUT AND IS CONSIDERED A CHAMPION ON THE ISSUE THOSE CONCERNS FOR ABORTION ISSUES AND ESTATE COULD PLAY A PART IN
DECIDING HOW LIKELY IT IS TO BECOME A RUNNING MATE. >> AND MORE THAN A WEEK NOW WE SEE HOW THIS PLAYS INTO THAT VP
PICK. NNAMDI EGWUONWU, THANK YOU. >>> OHIO SENATOR AND CURRENT REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER J.D. VANCE IS UNDER FIRE FOR
RESURFACED COMMENTS SEEM TO IMPLY PEOPLE WITHOUT CHILDREN SHOULD NOT HOLD OFFICE. WHITE
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT HAS A LOOK AT HOW HE IS RESPONDING IN THE WAY DEMOCRATS ARE USING THOSE REMARKS TO ATTACK THE GOP TICKET.
>> GOD BLESS YOU GUYS. >> Reporter: FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BICEPS PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE J.D. VANCE AT THE CENTER OF A POLITICAL FIRESTORM OVER THESE RESURFACED COMMENTS MADE IN
2021. WE ARE EFFECTIVELY FUN IN THIS COUNTRY.
DEMOCRATS ARE CORPORATE OLIGARCHS BY BUNCH OF CHILDLESS CAT LADIES. >> Reporter: VAN SEEMING TO IMPLY THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE IN GOVERNMENT.
>> KAMALA HARRIS, PETE BUTTIGIEG, AOC, THE ENTIRE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATS IS CONTROLLED BY PEOPLE WITHOUT CHILDREN. >> THOSE CLAIMS FIRST --
FORCING BACKLASH DEMOCRATS OPENING UP AN ATTACK ON THE GOP TICKET PRINTING THE NEWLY MINTED PAIRING WEIRD. >> IT'S NOT JUST A WEIRD STYLE
THAT HE BRINGS. IT'S THIS LEADS TO WEIRD POLICIES. >> IT IS BIZARRE. IT'S WEIRD. IT IS WEIRD.
>> EVEN JENNIFER ANISTON, WHO SPOKE PUBLICLY ABOUT HER STRUGGLES WITH INFERTILITY WRITING ON INSTAGRAM MR. VANCE, I PRAY THAT YOUR DAUGHTER IS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BEAR CHILDREN OF HER OWN ONE DAY.
VANCE INITIALLY OFFERING THIS SCATHING REPLY. >> FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S DISGUSTING BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER IS TWO YEARS OLD AND SECOND OF ALL IF SHE HAD FERTILITY PROBLEMS, AS I SAID IN THAT
SPEECH I WOULD TRY EVERYTHING I COULD TO HELP HER BECAUSE I BELIEVE FAMILIES AND BABIES ARE A GOOD THING OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A
SARCASTIC COMMENT. I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST CATS. >> Reporter: VANCE CONFRONTED AGAIN ON FOX NEWS.
>> DO YOU AGREE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO VERY MUCH LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND ARE INVESTED IN ITS FUTURE BUT THEY ALSO HAPPEN TO
BE CHILDLESS? >> OF COURSE I BELIEVE THAT.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FULL CONTEXT OF WHAT IS THAT IT'S CLEAR THE DEMOCRATS A TRY TO TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT. IT'S THE FACT THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY HAS BECOME EXPLICITLY ANTI-FAMILY AND SOME OF THEIR POLICIES. >> Reporter: THE VANCE TIME IS DRUMS RUNNING MATE NOT ALWAYS GOING AS PLANNED INCLUDING THIS AWKWARD JOKE ABOUT SODA TO SOME
LAYMEN THAT A LITTLE FLAT PICKS FROM THE STATES RACIST TO DO ANYTHING. I HAD A DIET MOUNTAIN DEW
YESTERDAY AND ONE DAY I'M SURE THEY WILL CALL IT RACIST TOO. BUT IT'S GOOD.
>> Reporter: THE TRUMP CRITICS QUESTIONING VANCE'S VALUES. THIN OUT THREE-TIME GOP
NOMINEE. >> DOES HE KEEP VANCE ON THE TICKET WHERE HE ALREADY HAS A
LOT OF BAGGAGE AND THAT WILL BE MORE PACKAGE OVER THE WEEKS
BECAUSE WE WOULD HEAR MORE THINGS ABOUT HIM OR DOES HE PICK SOMEONE NEW? IT'S HIS CHOICE. >> THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT.
DESPITE THESE BUMPS IN THE ROAD, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SO FAR IGNORED GROWING CRITICISM OF HIS CHOICE AND IS STANDING BY J.D. VANCE, CONTINUING TO CALL HIM A
GREAT PICK.
>>> WE ARE EXPECTING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. A FEW HOURS SENATE LAWMAKERS ARE EXPECTED TO QUESTION THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE SECRET
SERVICE ABOUT LAW-ENFORCEMENT LAPSES IN THE HOURS LEADING UP TO THE SHOOTING. THIS COMES AS THE FBI ANNOUNCED THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAS AGREED
TO PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERVIEW CALLED A VICTIM INTERVIEW WITH THE AGENCY. OUR SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL
CORRESPONDENT JOINS US WITH
MORE. THAT HEARING TODAY COMES AFTER THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE SECRET SERVICE KIMBERLY CHEATLE RESIGNED FOLLOWING THE GRILLING BY BOTH PARTIES LAST WEEK. SHE
WAS DECLINED TO ANSWER WHAT SEEMED LIKE VERY BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT. ARE WE EXPECTING TO SEE MORE OF THAT TODAY? >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A RARE JOINT HEARING BETWEEN THE SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. IT IS BEING PORTRAYED AS BIPARTISAN. STAFF MEMBERS FROM THOSE COMMITTEES HAVE JUST
RETURNED THEMSELVES FROM BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, THE SITE OF THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT,
TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION TO BETTER INFORM THEIR QUESTIONING OF THE FBI AND SECRET SERVICE TODAY.
AND SO, YOU KNOW, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THIS WILL BE MORE OF THE SAME. I DO THINK THE RESIGNATION OF CHEATLE LAST WEEK WAS A
RELEASE OF A PRESSURE VALVE ON CAPITOL HILL. IT DID SORT OF ALLEVIATE THE ANGER AND FRUSTRATION AT
CHEATLE NOT ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY NOW THAT THAT
IS HAPPENED, I THINK THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING WILL BE MORE ON THE SUBSTANCE AND LESS OF THE THEATER. SO A LOT OF QUESTIONS
STILL REMAIN. THE SENATORS WILL HIT ON THOSE TOPICS, INCLUDING HOW DID THIS SHOOTER, HOW WAS THE SHOOTER
ABLE TO GET A GUN ONTO THE PREMISES?
BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE INVESTIGATIONS GOING ON AND WE LEARNED A NEW DEVELOPMENT JUST YESTERDAY ON THE HOUSE
INVESTIGATION SIDE WHERE MIKE JOHNSON AND HAKEEM JEFFRIES HAVE APPOINTED MEMBERS OF THEIR
SPECIAL TASK FORCE, A BIPARTISAN TASK FORCE, THAT IS ALSO LOOKING INTO THIS SENSATION ATTEMPT? >> WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET SOME
ANSWERS ON THIS. AND WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW BETWEEN TRUMP AND THE FBI. A LOT OF INTEREST IN THAT. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT IT AND WHAT
ARE INVESTIGATORS HOPING TO LEARN FROM HIM? >> Reporter: THIS IS PRETTY STANDARD, IN FACT, THAT THE
VICTIM OF THIS INCIDENT, OR ANY INCIDENT, WOULD BE INTERVIEWED. THE FBI AND SECRET SERVICE, OF COURSE, ARE INTERVIEWING
EVERYBODY WHO WAS AT THE ACTUAL SHOOTING.
THEY'VE INTERVIEWED ALREADY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. BUT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A UNIQUE VANTAGE POINT. THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY HE
REACTED IN A CERTAIN WAY BACK
WHEN HE WENT DOWN AND HIT THE DECK, WHAT WERE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WERE HAPPENING. WE COULD HEAR THINGS BEING PICKED UP ON THE MICROPHONE,
SOME OF THOSE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SECRET SERVICE AGENTS THAT RUSH TO ASSIST THE FORMER PRESIDENT. AND WE HEARD
DIRECTIONS BEING GIVEN, I
THINK, INVESTIGATORS WANT TO KNOW WHETHER THERE WAS CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS WHO WERE TELLING
INVESTIGATORS AND WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP LATER THIS WEE
, IN FACT ON THURSDAY, WILL BE TELLING INVESTIGATORS. HE ACKNOWLEDGED IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY THAT HE WILL SIT FOR THIS INTERVIEW ON THURSDAY, TWO
DAYS FROM NOW. >> ALL RIGHT. MORE TO COME. >>> LONG, THANK YOU. >>> TURNING TO CALIFORNIA AS
FIRE CREWS ARE BATTLING ONE OF THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN THE STATE HISTORY. THE SO-CALLED PARK FIRE NOW
COVERS NEARLY 380,000 ACRES AND STILL GROWING AT A RAPID PACE.
STEVE PATTERSON IS IN CHICO AND JOINS US NOW WITH THE LATEST. GOOD MORNING.
THIS FIRE REALLY EXPLODED IN SIZE. WHAT ARE WE HEARING ABOUT HOW MUCH LARGER IT COULD BE EXPECTED TO GROW AND OUR CREWS GETTING ANY HANDLE ON IT?
>> Reporter: YEAH. LOOK. IT'S ENORMOUS AND THE THING THAT WAS SO STUNNING ABOUT IT WAS THE RATE AT WHICH IT'S GROWING. WE ARE NOT EVEN A WEEK
INTO THE FIRE AND MORE THAN 370,000 ACRES OF THE SIX LARGEST WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. MANY PEOPLE SAY BY THE TIME
IT'S DONE IT COULD BE FIFTH OR FOURTH AND IT COULD GROW THAT MUCH BUT FIREFIGHTERS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB SECURING AREAS THAT
ARE POPULATION CENTERS AND SLOWING THE GROWTH. OVER THE LAST THREE, FOUR OR FIVE DAYS NOW, THE WEATHER IS
DIPPED DOWN. IT'S BEEN COOLING ALLOWING FIREFIGHTERS TO GET MORE OF AN UPPER HAND. THEY HAVE MADE PROGRESS ON CONTAINMENT. NOW 14%. PUTTING A PERIMETER AROUND THE FIRE PIT ESSENTIALLY THOSE ZONES
ON THE PERIMETER ARE SAFE. TO SAY THAT AND SAY THAT THE
RESIDENTS AND WANT TO GET TO THEIR HOMES IS ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND WE ARE HEARING THAT EVACUATION ORDERS
MAY START LIFTING EARLIER TODAY. IT'S HARD TO SQUARE THAT WITH
THE FACT THIS FIRE IS LARGER THAN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR CERTAIN PARTS OF THE FIRE
ZONE WILL SOON BE ABLE TO BE INHABITABLE AGAIN. THAT'S THE SITUATION. THE FIRE IS A FIRE. FIRE BEHAVIOR CAN CHANGE WITH
THE WIND. THERE'S MORE HOT AND DRY WEATHER IN THE FORECAST.
IF THE WIND SHIFTS OR GETS HOTTER OR PUSHES IN A NEW DIRECTION OR POCKET EMBERS MOVE, THERE IS AN AFFRONT TO
THIS THING. >> HARD TO GRASP WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SIZE. IN REGARDS TO THE CAUSE OF THI
, A CALIFORNIA MAN FACING ARSON CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRE? YESTERDAY RONNIE DEAN STOUT MADE
HIS FIRST COURT APPEARANCE WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?
>> Reporter: RONNIE DEAN STOUT
MADE HIS FIRST COURT APPEARANCE. HIS SECOND WILL BE ON THURSDAY WHERE HE WILL BE ARRAIGNED ON CHARGES. WE KNOW THERE WILL BE FEDERAL
CHARGES FOR ARSON. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY IS IF THEY WILL BE OF THE RECKLESS VARIETY OR INTENTIONAL, WHICH WILL SET SOME OF THE SENTENCING GUIDELINES.
WE KNOW WHAT HE IS ACCUSED OF. APPARENTLY WITNESSES SAY HE SAW THIS GUY GET IN HIS CAR AND PUT SOMETHING IN HIS CAR. ALL THE SUDDEN THE CARS ON FIRE
AND HE'S PUSHING IT INTO A GOALIE THAT EXTENSIVELY STARTS A FIRE WHICH IS NOW LARGER THAN THE SIZE OF A LARGE AMERICAN CITY.
OBVIOUSLY, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAYS HE WANTS TO PUSH FOR THOSE FEDERAL ARSON CHARGES
AND WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THAT SHAKES OUT BUT THERE WILL
BE ENHANCEMENTS ON TOP OF THOSE BASED ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE FIRE. THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION ON A FIRE. IF THEY FIND PEOPLE HAVE DIED
OR THEY FIND MORE PROPERTY HAS BEEN DESTROYED, THAT WILL BE ADDED ONTO THE CHARGES HE IS ALREADY FACING.
>> CERTAINLY HOPE THINGS GET UNDER CONTROL THERE. THANK YOU. >>> NOW LET'S GET TO METEOROLOGIST ANGIE LASSMAN
KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THOSE FIRE THREATS AND THAT SMOKE
SITUATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY. >> WE CONTINUE TO SEE CONDITIONS RIPE FOR MORE OF THESE FIRES TO SPARK AND SPREAD PICTURES WHAT'S GOING ON. WE HAVE RED FLAG WARNINGS.
NOT NECESSARILY UP FOR PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA, OREGON OR WASHINGTON WHERE WE HAVE PLENTY OF FIRES BURNING BUT THEY ARE IN EFFECT FOR OTHER SPOTS ACROSS THE FOUR CORNERS REGION
BUT NOTICE CASPER AND PARK CITY ARE INCLUDED WITH THE WIND STILL ELEVATED AND HUMIDITY LEVELS LOW AND TEMPERATURES
ELEVATED.
WE WILL WATCH FOR THESE CONDITIONS TO LAST THROUGH THE DAY. ON TOP OF THAT WITH THOSE FIRES BURNING, PLENTY OF UNHEALTHY AIR. 9 MILLION PEOPLE UNDER AIR QUALITY ALERTS OF SOME SORT.
WHERE YOU SEE THE DARKER SHADE OF BROWN, THAT IS THE AIR- QUALITY ADVISORIES AND EFFECT
INCLUDING BOISE AND IT GOES INTO PARTS OF OREGON AND WASHINGTON. THIS GRAY COLOR IN NORTHWESTERN
NEVADA AND NORTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA IS A DENSE SMOKE ADVISORY. WE HAVE PLENTY OF THAT SMOKE ON THE MOVE OVER THE
NEXT DAY OR SO AND IT'S NOT JUST CONFINED TO THAT AREA.
IF YOU LIVE IN THOSE AREAS WITH ALERTS, THAT IS WHERE WE ARE CONCERNED IF YOU HAVE RESPIRATORY ISSUES OR BREATHING CONDITIONS LATER TODAY. NOTICE AS THE DAY GOES ON.
THAT WELFARE SMOKE WILL MOVE INTO PARTS OF THE MIDWEST AND THE NORTHERN PLAINS.
YOU MAY NOTICE IT'S A LITTLE HAZY IN THE SKIES OVERHEAD. SATELLITE AND RADAR PICKING UP
RAIN ACROSS THE MIDWEST AND THE OHIO VALLEY AND PARTS OF THE GREAT LAKES. WE HAVE A COLD FRONT ON THE MOVE AND IT LEAVES US UNSETTLED
CROSS THOSE REGIONS BUT ALSO FROM MAINE TO FLORIDA WE SEE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE DAY TODAY AND TOMORROW PICK MORE RAIN IN THE FORECAST ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC, NEW ENGLAND.
THE GOOD NEWS FOR TOMORROW IS THE SEVERE RISK IS LOW BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE TODAY. WE HAVE THIS LASTING THROUGH TONIGHT. THE BIGGEST IMPACTS LOOK TO BE
THE THREAT OF STRONG WIND. 70, 75 MILES PER HOUR GUSTS POSSIBLE BUT A GOOD CHUNK OF
THE COUNTRY IS INCLUDED IN THAT. 18 MILLION FROM OMAHA THROUGH NASHVILLE OR SOMETHING WE'RE WATCHING ON TOP OF HEAVY RAIN ACROSS THE REGION AS A FLASH
FLOODING IS ALSO AN ISSUE EXPERIMENT HAVE YOU SEEN TWISTERS YET? >> IN SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. I'VE NOT SEEN IT YET.
HAVE YOU? >> I HAVE NOT BUT I'M NOT A METEOROLOGIST. I AM MARRIED TO METEOROLOGIST.
THE GRIEF. A LOT OF ANGER AIMED AT NETANYAHU HOW THIS IS ABLE TO HAPPEN. FOLKS ASKING WHETHER
ROCK WAS NOT INTERCEPTED BY THE IRON DOME. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT? THIS IS SOMETHING BEING LOOKED INTO?
>> Reporter: IT IS THAT THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS THEY ARE INVESTIGATING HOW IT IS THAT ROCKET GOT THROUGH AND IT WASN'T INTERCEPTED. THEY ARE SAYING THAT ISRAEL'S
AIR DEFENSES, PROBABLY SOME THE MOST SOPHISTICATED IN THE WORLD BUT NOT 100%.
NOT 100% FOOLPROOF.
THE ROCKET GETTING THROUGH ON THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. WE SAW A DRONE FROM YEMEN GETTING THROUGH IN TEL AVIV THE OTHER WEEK. SO THEY CAN'T SHOOT DOWN
EVERYTHING ALL OF THE TIME IS BASICALLY THE MESSAGE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES A COMPLICATED IS BECAUSE YOU ARE SO CLOSE TO SOUTHERN LEBANON
RIGHT THERE.
RESIDENTS ONLY HAVE EIGHT AND 12 SECONDS SOMETIMES TO RUN TO BOMB SHELTERS. WE KNOW THE SIRENS WENT OFF BUT THE IRON DOME FAILED TO
INTERCEPT AND AS YOU MENTIONED, PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU VISITING THE SCENE YESTERDAY WAS MET BY A LARGE AND ANGRY CROWD. PEOPLE CALLING HIM A KILLER AND
SAYING HIS GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN SAFE.
>> TALK TO US ABOUT THESE U.S. LED EFFORTS TO TRY TO CONTAIN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HEZBOLLAH. ISRAEL HAS BEEN BOMBING SOUTHERN LEBANON TO GET TO
THEM. HOW LIKELY IS IT ISRAEL COULD TURN ITS TARGETS TOWARD THE CAPITAL THERE IN LEBANON, BEIRUT? >> Reporter: THAT'S THE BIG
QUESTION AND SOMETHING ISRAEL HAS NOT DONE OVER THE 9 1/2
MONTHS IT'S BEEN FIGHTING HEZBOLLAH OVER ITS NORTHERN BORDER. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU IS SAYING THE RESPONSE WILL BE UNPRECEDENTED . IT WILL BE UNLIKE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR
THIS WAS A MAJOR ATTACK. ISRAEL SAID IT'S THE WORST ATTACK ON AN CIVILIAN SINCE OCTOBER 7. YOU HAVE 12 DEAD CHILDREN AND NETANYAHU IS
UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE FROM THE FAR RIGHT OF HIS GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND IN A MAJOR WAY,
POTENTIALLY INCLUDING ATTACKING BEIRUT. THE U.S. IS SAYING IT'S SUPPORTING ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF BUT IS COUNSELING
RESTRAINT AND DOES NOT WANT TO SEE AN ALL-OUT CONFLICT CORRUPTING AND IT WAS INTERESTING.
THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL JOHN KIRBY SPEAKING YESTERDAY SAYS AT THIS POINT THE U.S. BELIEVES THE
PREDICTIONS OF ALL OUT WAR BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HEZBOLLAH ARE EXAGGERATED AND THE U.S. IS CONFIDENT A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION
CAN BE REACHED. THAT IS NOT A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE SHARED ACROSS THE REGION. >> CERTAINLY NOT AND WE'VE SEEN
FALLOUT EXTENDING BEYOND THE REGION WITH AIRLINES CANCELING SOME OF ITS FLIGHTS TO LEBANON. SOME COUNTRIES URGING CITIZENS
TO LEAVE. HOW IS LEBANON ITSELF REACTING AND WHAT ARE THEY SAYING ABOUT
THIS POTENTIAL FOR ESCALATION?
>> Reporter: THE UK INTO THE COUNTRIES ARE GIVING THEIR NATIONALS A STARK MESSAGE. GET OUT OF LEBANON AND DO IT NOW
. THAT IS NOT A MESSAGE THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS SENDING TO AMERICANS IN LEBANON, AT LEAST NOT YET BUT AS YOU SAID, FLIGHTS ARE
CANCELED AND IT'S GETTING MORE AND MORE COMPLICATED TO GET BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
WE DID HEAR FROM THE LEBANON FOREIGN MINISTER WHO IS SAYING HE HOPES IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO AVOID ALL-OUT WAR. LISTEN. >> WE THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE
A LITTLE BIT OF ESCALATION, BUT NOT THAT BIG BECAUSE THE
ISRAELIS THEMSELVES ARE GOING TO BE HIT. AND IF THEY GO
AGAINST LEBANON, IS GOING TO BE A BIG WAR AND THEY KNOW THAT AND I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO DO IT.
>> Reporter: AT THIS POINT PEOPLE ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST ARE HOLDING THEIR BREATH WAITING TO SEE WHEN, WHERE, AND AT WHAT SCALE ISRAEL WILL RESPOND.
>> TENSIONS REMAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>> AND THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME ON MORNING NEWS NOW.
>>> THEY ARE FLIPPING INCREDIBLE.
TEAM USA MEETING THE MOMENT IN MEN'S GYMNASTICS AND ENDING A 16 YEAR MEDAL DROUGHT. WE TAKE YOU TO PARIS FOR ALL THAT EXCITEMENT EXTRACT BUT FIRST AFTER THE BREAK, TRAGEDY
IN THE UK. AT LEAST TWO CHILDREN KILLED IN TH PRETTY BAD.
>>> WE ARE BACK WITH THE LATEST ON A DEADLY STABBING ATTACK AT A TAYLOR SWIFT-THEMED KIDS DANCE EVENT. TWO CHILDREN ARE DEAD AND NINE
OTHERS HEART AFTER THE ATTACK IN NORTHERN ENGLAND. POLICE SAY A TEENAGER IS IN
CUSTODY. OUR CHIEF CORN CORRESPONDENT HAS THE DETAILS.
>> Reporter: WHEN PARENTS WORRY ABOUT A SENSELESS ATTACK, THIS IS WHAT THEY FEAR. AROUND NOON IN SOUTHPORT IN
NORTHERN ENGLAND NEAR LIVERPOOL, AN ASSAILANT WALKED
INTO A DANCE AND YOU CUSTODIO AND BEGAN STABBING CHILDREN. IT WAS DURING A SOLD-OUT TAYLOR SWIFT-THEMED CLASS FOR 6 TO 11
YEAR-OLDS. WITNESSES SAW BLOODY CHILDREN BEING TAKEN OUT. ONE DESCRIBING IT LIKE A HORROR
MOVIE. >> TWO CHILDREN HAVE DIED AS A RESULT OF INJURIES SUSTAINED IN THIS MORNING'S LIFE ATTACK.
NINE OTHER CHILDREN HAVE BEEN INJURED AND SIX OF THEM ARE IN A CRITICAL CONDITION. >> Reporter: THE SUSPECT WAS ONLY IDENTIFIED BY POLICE AS A 17-YEAR-OLD MALE FROM A NEARBY
TOWN. >> I'M STILL SHAKING. I STILL CAN'T -- I CAN'T THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT'S SHOCKING EVERYONE.
>> Reporter: NO MOTIVE WAS GIVEN. IT'S NOT BEING INVESTIGATED AS TERRORISM. NO OTHER SUSPECTS ARE BEING SOUGHT? >> OUR THOUGHTS AND CONDOLENCES WITH THE VICTIMS, THEIR FAMILIES
, THEIR FRIENDS, AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY AND IT'S ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THE GRIEF THEY ARE GOING THROUGH AND THE TRAUMA THEY ARE GOING THROUGH.
>> JUST AWFUL. OUR THANKS TO RICHARD ENGEL FOR THAT REPORT. >>> AND IN THE LAST FEW HOURS,
SWIFT HAS RESPONDED TO THE ATTACK ON INSTAGRAM WRITING, QUOTE, THESE WERE JUST LITTLE KIDS AT A DANCE CLASS. I AM AT A COMPLETE LOSS FOR HAD TO EVER CONVEY MY SYMPATHIES TO
THESE FAMILIES. >>> MORE INTERNATIONAL NEWS. THIS MORNING RESCUE TEAMS ARE ON THE MOVE AFTER HEAVY RAIN
TRIGGERED DEADLY LANDSLIDES IN
SOUTHERN INDIA. OUR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT MEGAN FITZGERALD JOINS US WITH THAT AND OTHER WORLD HEADLINES. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING.
WE START IN INDIA. THAT LANDSLIDE KILLED AT LEAST 70 PEOPLE ON THE SOUTHERN COASTAL CITY. THE DEATH TOLL IS EXPECTED TO RISE. TO MAKE THINGS MORE
DEVASTATING, RESCUE WORKERS HAVE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE GETTING TO THE SCENE BECAUSE ROADS HAVE BEEN WASHED AWAY AND BRIDGES COLLAPSED TO THE GOVERNMENT SAID THEY'RE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN TO GET
CHOPPERS OPERATING IN THE REGION TO RESCUE PEOPLE BUT THEY ARE DEALING WITH BAD WEATHER. >>> AND VENEZUELA IN THE MIDST
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PROTESTING AFTER DISPUTED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, PRESIDENT MADURO'S OPPONENT EDMUNDO GONZALEZ SAID HIS CAMPAIGN HAS THE PROOF THEY NEED
TO SHOW THAT GONZALES IS THE ONE WHO WON THE ELECTION. CAMPAIGN SAYS THEY OBTAINED MORE THAN 70% OF THE TALLY SHEETS WHICH SHOWS KEY HAS MORE
THAN DOUBLED THE VOTES OF MADURO. SEVERAL FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING THE U.S. AND THE EU HAVE HELD OFF ON RECOGNIZING THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION.
>>> FOR CHAMPAGNE LOVERS WE GOT
ONE FOR YOU. DIVERS FOUND OVER 100, OR NEARLY 100 BOTTLES OF 19th CENTURY CHAMPAGNE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BALTIC SEA AT THE SITE OF A SHIPWRECK.
RESEARCHERS THINK THE SHIP COULD'VE BEEN HEADING TO RUSSIA TO DELIVER THE GOODS TO CZAR ALEXANDER II. THE OBVIOUS QUESTION HERE OF
COURSE IS CAN YOU DRINK THE CHAMPAGNE? ACCORDING TO A MASTER
SOMMELIER, AS LONG AS THE COURT WAS NOT IMPACTED BY THE SEAWATER, IT SHOULD BE PRETTY GOOD. I WOULD NOT MIND TRYING A BOTTLE OF THAT.
>> SOMETHING GOOD TO CELEBRATE. I CAN IMAGINE THE PRICE TAG FOR IT. >> RIGHT HERE THANK YOU.

ALL ABORTIONS AFTER SIX WEEKS. THE NEW LAW TOOK EFFECT YESTERDAY NEARLY ONE MONTH AFTER THE STATE SUPREME COURT RULED MAC THERE IS NO

OUR SENIOR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT LAURA JARRETT SPOKE WITH AN OB/GYN IN IOWA ABOUT THE IMPACT THIS COULD HAVE ON MATERNAL HEALTH. >> Reporter: A NEW REALITY IN
IOWA. NEARLY ALL ABORTIONS NOW BANNED MAKING THE MIDWEST STATE JUST THE LATEST TO FAN THE
FLAMES OF A POLITICAL FIRE BURNING OVER REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS HEADING INTO NOVEMBER.
DIVIDED STATE SUPREME COURT RECENTLY UPHOLDING THE LAW THAT BANS ABORTIONS IN MOST CASES ONCE ANY FETAL CARDIAC ACTIVITY
IS DETECTED, WHICH CAN BE AS EARLY AS SIX WEEKS OF
PREGNANCY. GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS APPLAUDING THE COURT FOR UPHOLDING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
. THE LAW INCLUDES SOME LIMITED EXCEPTIONS ALLOWING ABORTIONS IN CASES WHERE FETAL ABNORMALITIES ARE COMICAL, INCOMPATIBLE WITH LIFE. A STANDARD DOCTORS SAY IS LESS THAN CLEAR? >> DOES THAT MEAN AN INFANT

ONLY FULL-TIME OB/GYN IN HER RURAL COUNTY SAYS SHE WORRIES LOSS LIKE THIS ONE TIE PHYSICIAN HANDS INTO DANGEROUS
WAYS WHEN MEDICAL PUBLICATIONS ARISE. >> WE KNOW THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CAN GO REALLY
WRONG. THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE MORE NUANCED THAN WHAT OUR LEGISLATURE CAN PUT ON PAPER. THERE IS A LOT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DREAD, I WOULD SAY, RIGHT NOW.
>> Reporter: IOWA IS ONE OF FOUR STATES BANNING ABORTIONS ONCE ANY FETAL CARDIAC ACTIVITY IS DETECTED. ALL OF THIS ALSO NOW FRONT AND
CENTER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS HAS MADE ABORTION ACCESS THE CENTERPIECE OF HER PLATFORM. >> THOUGH TODAY, I WILL PUT IN
PLACE A TRUMP ABORTION BAN, WHICH MAKES IOWA THE 22nd STATE OR COUNTRY TO HAVE A TRUMP ABORTION BAN. >> NOW IT'S UP TO THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IN EACH STATE.
IT'S UP TO THE VOTERS. >> Reporter: BACK IN IOWA, THE FOCUS ON THE FUTURE. >> I BELIEVE WE WILL SEE MORE AND MORE PROVIDERS LEAVING

DR. GEORGE JAMES. DR. JAMES, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND LET'S JUMP INTO THIS NEW STUDY OUT FOR MENTAL HEALTH AMERICA THAT SAYS ONE IN FOUR ADULTS IN THE U.S. STRUGGLING
WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH REPORTED THEY DID NOT SEE A DOCTOR BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH IT COSTS.
SO HOW IS CAUSE FOR THIS CARE IS STILL SUCH A BIG ISSUE FOR US AND FOR SOMEWHAT WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT HELP,
WHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET SOME ASSISTANCE?
>> GOOD MORNING. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR A LONG TIME WHERE PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD THERAPY BECAUSE OF THE COST OR INSURANCE OR MEDICAL
DEBT THEY MAY HAVE. IT'S A BIGGER PROBLEM. WE NEED MORE THERAPISTS AND WE NEED DIFFERENT SERVICES BUT ONE OF THE WAYS PEOPLE CAN DO WITH THIS IS THERE ARE SERVICES THAT
WILL OFFER THERAPY FOR FREE. YOU CAN STILL SEE A THERAPIST AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO ASK THE
QUESTION AND YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE SOMEONE MAYBE EVEN TODAY.
>> CERTAINLY IMPORTANT AND HOPEFULLY PEOPLE CAN FIND THAT
HELP. ALSO TALKING ABOUT THIS NEXT STUDY THAT HAS TO DO WITH MENTAL HEALTH. IT REVEALS HOW MOMS ARE AFFECTED MENTALLY WHEN CHORES
ARE NOT SPLIT EVENLY AT HOME AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF SOMETHING CALLED COGNITIVE
LABOR. EXPLAIN TO US WHAT THAT IS AND WHY IS SUCH A BIG ISSUE.
>> FOR MANY HOUSEHOLDS, CHORES
ARE DIVIDED AND OFTEN MOMS GET THE BRUNT OF THIS AND WHAT COGNITIVE LABOR IS NOT ONLY DO
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE REPLENISHED OR DONE, WHO NEEDS TO BE PICKED UP. OFTEN THIS
LABOR IS NOT SHARED IN THE HOUSEHOLD.
MANY MOMS TAKE ON THIS RESPONSIBILITY SO YOU CAN SAY, MOMS, ASK FOR HELP. THAT'S ONE WAY BUT IT STILL PUTS THE PRESSURE ON MOM TO FIGURE OUT.
WHAT WE CAN DO A STEP UP IN MY HOUSEHOLD IT COULD BE I WILL LOAD THE DISHWASHER SO MY WIFE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT. THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS YOU
CAN DO TO ASSIST THE MOMS IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD SO THEY DON'T HAVE THE COGNITIVE LOAD. >> AND TO ASSIST WITHOUT BEING ASKED IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT AREA.
AND DR. JAMES, ONE OF THE PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO WORKS WITH TEETH -- TEAM USA GIVING TIPS
TEACHERS WITH TOP ATHLETICS. THIS IS BEEN A BIG HEADLINE DURING THIS YEAR'S GAMES. MENTAL HEALTH GETTING A BIG FOCUS THIS YEAR.
HELP US TAKE ON THIS GOLD MEDAL FOR MENTAL HEALTH.
WHAT ARE THE BIG TAKEAWAYS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE FROM THIS AND APPLY TO OUR OWN LIVES? >> FIRST OF ALL THIS IS ONE OF THOSE DREAM JOBS ARE CALL ME
RIGHT NOW AND I WILL GO TO PARIS AND BE THERE TO HELP THE ATHLETES. THIS IS AMAZING. WE SEE ELITE ATHLETES AND WE
TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. WE HAVE SEEN FROM SIMONE BILES, CALEB TRUSSELL, MICHAEL PHELPS
-- SO MANY ATHLETES HAVE SAID THEY STRUGGLED WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND DEPRESSION AND THEY NEED HELP AND SUPPORT AND NOW
THERE ARE SUPPORTIVE PEOPLE THERE FOR THEM. CHEERS TO THOSE ATHLETES AND
ALL THEY ARE DOING TO CHAMPION MENTAL HEALTH.
>> SO IMPORTANT. WHAT A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR ALL OF US. YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS ALIKE. DR. JAMES, THANK YOU. >> THANK YOU.
>>> COMING UP. MORE ON THE HISTORY IN PARIS FOR TEAM USA. WE ARE JOINED BY
>>> WE ARE BACK WITH OLYMPIC
HISTORY. THE FIRST AMERICAN FENCER TO EVER WIN BACK-TO-BACK GOLD MEDALS IN THE WOMEN'S INDIVIDUAL EVENT.
AFTER ALMOST DOUBLE DIGIT WIN IN SUNDAY'S FINAL BOUT. AND SHE'S ONLY THE THIRD WOMAN
TO BE A REPEAT OLYMPIC CHAMP IN THE EVENT EVER. SO EXCITED TO
HAVE LEE KIEFER JOINING US THIS MORNING. FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR SECOND OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL. THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT TOOK TO WIN IT ONCE. HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW AND WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU REALIZED YOU WERE GOING TO WIN GOLD AGAIN?
>> OH, MAN, I WAS SO HAPPY TO PUT ON A GOOD PERFORMANCE BECAUSE, UNLIKE TOKYO, MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS, I THINK MAY
BE A GROUP OF 30 OR 40 PEOPLE WERE THERE TO CHEER ME ON. AMAZING? >> THAT'S INCREDIBLE. WAS IT HARDER THE SECOND TIME
AROUND? >> IN OME WAYS IT WAS HARDER. I KNEW I COULD DO IT AND THERE WERE A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS, BUT
AT THE END OF THE DAY JUST GOING OUT THERE EMMA TOUCHED BY TOUCH AND ABOUT BY BOUT.
IT'S NOT TOO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE. >> CLEARLY.
YOU HAD IT DOWN. AND YOU'RE NOT DONE YET PICK YOU ARE FOCUSED ON THE WOMEN'S TEAM FOIL COMPETITION ON THURSDAY. WALK US THROUGH HOW YOU REPAIR
FOR THAT BOTH MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY. >> YEAH. MY TEAMMATES AND ME, WE ALL
JUST HAD OUR LAST PRACTICE ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. WE FINISHED THAT. WE'RE JUST
TRYING TO GET IN GOOD SPIRITS AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE ALL THE DETAILS LOCKED AND LOADED ABOUT OUR OPPONENTS AND WE WOULD JUST
SHOW UP TO THE STRIP. >> WE CAN'T WAIT.
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND ARE BOTH ON TEAM USA. THEY BOTH COMPETED IN THE TOKYO OLYMPICS AND NOW YOU GET TO BE IN PARIS TOGETHER.
HOW DOES IT FEEL AND WHAT IS IT LIKE TO EXPERIENCE THIS WITH HIM? >> WE ARE HAVING THE BEST TIME EXPLORING THE VILLAGE AND SEEING OUR FAMILIES.
I COULD NOT ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE. >> THAT IS PERFECT AND HOW DO YOU LIKE PARIS? HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO LAST TIME AROUND? >> PARIS IS AMAZING.
FENCING IS HELD IN A HISTORIC VENUE. AND I THINK FENCING LUCKED OUT.
>> THAT IS AWESOME. I WAS JUST THERE AND THEY SAW HOW MUCH EVERYTHING IS LOCKED DOWN SO REVISITING PARIS RIGHT NOW, GO AGAIN WHEN EVERYTHING IS MORE OPEN AND YOU GET TO
EXPERIENCE. A WHOLE NEW WORLD. AND YOU STARTED FENCING WHEN YOU ARE JUST FIVE YEARS OLD. SUPER IMPRESSIVE. WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO GET INTO THE SPORT, OTHER THAN WINNING
OLYMPIC GOLD TWICE, WHAT IS BEEN THE BEST PART OF YOUR EXPERIENCE COMPETING? >> SO, MY DAD GOT ME AND MY
SIBLINGS INTO THE SPORT AT A YOUNG AGE. THEY INSTILLED THAT IDEA OF HARD WORK AND EVENTUALLY WE GREW TO BE COMPETITORS, TO HAVE ARTISTRY IN OUR CRAFT, AND I'M
THE LAST REMAINING IN THE SPORT. WE ARE 20 PLUS YEARS LATER. >> THERE YOU ARE. CERTAINLY
KNEW IT WAS HAPPENING. TWO GOLD MEDALS. SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE GET INSPIRED BY WATCHING THE
OLYMPICS TO START BUT MY HUSBAND STILL TALKS ABOUT HOW
HE SHOULD'VE BEEN AN OLYMPIC SWIMMER BECAUSE HE WAS SO INTERESTED IN WATCHING SWIMMING
AS A YOUNG MAN. WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST PIECE OF ADVICE? WHAT DO YOU TELL YOUNG ATHLETES TO HAVE THESE OLYMPIC DREAMS? >> YEAH. I TELL PEOPLE THAT FENCING IS A
SPORT FOR EVERYONE. YOU CAN HAVE DIFFERENT SIZED
BODIES. YOU CAN BE TALL OR SHORT AND DIFFERENT BUILDS AND YOU CAN FIND YOUR PLACE.
IT'S REALLY BEEN A COOL JOURNEY FOR MYSELF TO DISCOVER MY OWN STYLE AND I WOULD LOVE THAT FOR ANY YOUNG ATHLETE.
>> SUCH A GREAT MESSAGE COMING FROM THIS TWO-TIME GOLD
MEDALIST. LEE KIEFER. DATA FOR JOINING US TODAY AND BEST OF LUCK AND WE WILL CERTAINLY BE WATCHING ON THURSDAY. >> THANK YOU.
>> ARE RIGHT. AND NOW TWO MORE OLYMPIC NEWS THIS MORNING. THERE IS ANOTHER AMERICAN CELEBRATING A FENCING MEDAL IN PARIS AFTER A SUSPENSION ROAD TO THE FINAL FOUR, THE BRONZE
WAS SECURED AND THE INDIVIDUAL FOIL EVENT ON MONDAY. THE NUMBER TWO RANKED MEN'S FOIL PENCIL IN THE WORLD HAS NO MEDALS IN HIS SECOND STRAIGHT
OLYMPICS AND THAT WAS JUST ONE OF EIGHT NEW MEDALS FOR TEAM
USA ON MONDAY. THE MEN'S ARTISTIC GYMNASTICS TEAM ADDED TO THE MEDAL COUNT
AND LED IN A THRILLING FASHION BY EARNING A BRONZE IN THE FINAL EVENT THAT CAME DOWN TO THE WIRE. JOINING US FROM PARIS WITH THE
EXCITEMENT FROM ANOTHER OLYMPICS DAY IS NBC'S JAY GRAY.
GOOD MORNING. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE MEN'S GYMNASTICS FINAL? WE GOT A VIRAL POMMEL HORSE
HERO FROM IT ALL. WHO ELSE ONE FOR TEAM USA? >> Reporter: ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
UNSUSPECTED AND FREELY A BONUS WIN FOR GYMNASTICS. THE MEN GOING IN AND GETTING THAT
BRONZE. THEY HAD NOT BEEN IN THE MEDAL ROUND IN 16 YEARS AND IT ALL CAME DOWN TO THAT POMMEL.
YOU'VE GOT STEPHEN NEDOROSCIK , WHO WAS AWAITING -- AND I MEAN
WAITING IN THE SENSE THAT HE DID NOTHING ELSE ALL NIGHT. HE WATCHED EVERYTHING. HE WAITED. HE WATCHED SOME MORE. WE DID OVER TWO HOURS BEFORE HE GETS HIS ONE CHANCE TO SECURE
THE VICTORY FOR TEAM USA. AND HE NAILED IT. HE WAS FANTASTIC. THEY WERE ALL FOCUSED. LIKE I SAID, THEY BRING HOME A
BEEN A MAC FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A DECADE. IN HEARING FROM THE WOMEN'S SIDE IN GYMNASTICS -- AND WE
KNOW HOW DOMINANT THEY ARE -- THEY SAY IT GIVES THEM A BOOST SEEING THEIR PARTNERS COME IN TO DO THE UNEXPECTED.
ONE OF THOSE OLYMPICS STORIES WILL CHERISH. >> A LOT OF INSPIRATION THERE. AND IT WAS A GOOD DAY FOR
SEVERAL OTHER TEAMS. WOMEN'S BASKETBALL ABSOLUTELY DOMINATED AS THEY LOOK TO WIN AN EIGHTH STREET GOLD MEDAL. HOW ARE THEY LOOKING?
>> Reporter: YEAH. IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD DAY TO BE PART OF WOMEN'S USA BASKETBALL. THEY JUST SHELLACKED TO JAPAN. THIS TEAM THEY PLAYED IN THE GOLD-MEDAL FINAL NOT THAT LONG
AGO. THEY BEAT THEM BY 26 PICK ONE OR 2-76 PICK THEY ARE
UNSTOPPABLE RIGHT NOW. THEY LOOK GREAT. I THINK THEY COULD CHALLENGE THE MEN'S TEAM. THEY LOOK SO GOOD AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND THEY ARE FAVORED
TO WIN WHAT WOULD BE AN OLYMPIC RECORD EIGHTH GOLD MEDAL IN A
ROW. I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. THEY HAVE 156 AND ROW. THAT WAS THE 56th STRAIGHT WIN. DO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY LOST LAST? WHICH OLYMPICS IT WAS?
>> NO. I DO NOT. >> I DID NOT EITHER UNTIL I
LOOKED IT UP. 1992 IN BARCELONA. THEY HAVE NOT LOST A GAME SINCE
'92. IT'S PRETTY AMAZING. >> THAT IS AMAZING AND THE CREDIBLE AND THERE'S MORE TO
GET EXCITED ABOUT TODAY. SIMONE BILES RETURNING TO THE MAT. SO MANY EYES ON THIS. A
PERSONAL QUESTION. HOW EXCITED ARE YOU FOR TODAY'S LINEUP? >> Reporter: I THINK IT'S GOING
TO BE FANTASTIC. THE WOMEN'S TEAM CAME IN, ESPECIALLY BILES, WITH THE IDEA
THIS WAS A REDEMPTION TOUR. WE REMEMBER TOKYO DID NOT GO AS PLANNED AND IT WAS A ROUGH RIDE SO NOW THEY ARE BACK. THEY WERE
THE BEST TEAM COMING OUT OF QUALIFYING WITH THE HIGHEST SCORES. SHE IS AN INDIVIDUAL HAD THE HIGHEST SCORE AND SHE LOOKS SO LOCKED AND FOCUSED ON ALL OF
THIS. I THINK WE ARE IN FOR QUITE A SHOW IN JUST A FEW HOURS HERE AND JUST COME IN CLOSE FOR A MINUTE. DON'T SHARE THIS WITH ANYBODY
ELSE. WE HAVE A SNEAK PEEK AT THE LEOTARD THEY WILL BE WEARING TONIGHT. THIS IS IT IT'S CALLED GO FOR
GLORY. THAT'S THE NAME.
IF YOU CAN GET THIS THING ON, YOU'VE GOT NO CHOICE BUT TO GO FOR GLORY. IT IS DESIGNED WITH THE IDEA THAT IT RESEMBLES THE 1996
WOMEN'S LEOTARD. THEY WON THE GOLD MEDAL AS WELL SO IT'S ATTRIBUTE TO THEM. IT'S GOT JUST UNDER 10,000
CRYSTALS ALL OVER THE SLEEVES AND THE BACK. IT IS AN AMAZING, WONDERFUL
WORK OF ART AND BOY DOES IT SHIMMER IN THE SUMMER SUN AND PARIS. I KNOW THAT NUMBER BECAUSE LITTLE-KNOWN TRIVIA FACT HERE -- I BEDAZZLED THIS ENTIRE
THING FOR THE WHOLE TEAM.
I AM A TRUE SUPPORTER OF TEAM USA GYMNASTICS. NO I DIDN'T. BUT LOOK AT IT. IT'S FANTASTIC. >> THAT IS INCREDIBLE. I BETTER NOT SEE THAT ON eBAY.
IMPRESSIVE STUFF. >> Reporter: THE PROBLEM IS -- AND I WAS GOING TO SURPRISE YOU
-- IT JUST DOESN'T FIT RIGHT SO I DID NOT WEAR IT TODAY? PAYMENT WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER SIZE. THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP THIS MORNING.
READY TO STAND AGAIN. WHEN WE RETURN WE TAKE YOU TO KANSAS WHERE A NEW STATUE OF BASKETBALL

>> PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND EACH OTHER.
>>> WELCOME BACK. IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS SINCE A STATUE A BASEBALL PIONEER JACKIE ROBINSON WAS STOLEN FROM A CITY PARK IN WICHITA, KANSAS, BUT A NEW ONE WILL RISE EARLY
NEXT MONTH THANKS TO HELP FROM A NEIGHBORING STATE. DEREK LETO FROM HER SISTER STATION KSN W HAS THE DETAILS.

DESTROYED, SHE WAS UNSURE THEY WOULD EVER SEE HER HUSBAND'S WORK AGAIN. >> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S HERE ALREADY. IT'S JUST GONE BY.
IN A WHIRLWIND. >> SHE SAID IT WILL MAKE HER EMOTIONAL WHEN SHE SEES THE NEW STATUE IN PERSON FOR THE FIRST TIME NEXT WEEK. >> OH, YEAH.
I EXPECT TO BE. I KNOW IT WILL. IT WILL BE BITTERSWEET.
>> Reporter: A BRONZE FOUNDRY IN COLORADO WILL USE JOHN'S MOLDY LEFT BEHIND TO MAKE THE REPLACEMENT STATUE. THE OWNER,
TONY WORKMAN, SAID THE STAFF THAT MADE THE ORIGINAL TOOK PRIDE IN THE COUNTLESS HOURS AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL SPENT ON THE REPLACEMENT. >> ALMOST EVERYBODY THAT WORKED
ON IT, WORKED ON THE ORIGINAL. I'M GLAD WE COULD HELP AND GET
BACK AND GET THEIR SCULPTURE BACK TO THEM AND NO ONE WILL
KNOW IT WAS EVER GONE ONCE IT'S INSTALLED. >> Reporter: AN EMOTIONAL TIME
FOR ELITE 42 FOUNDER. HE SAID HE MET WITH THE MAN WHO PLEADED GUILTY TO THEFT AND DESTRUCTION OF THIS STATUE. HE
SAID IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON. >> I HOPE EVERYBODY COMES OUT OF THIS FOR THE BETTER,
INCLUDING THE PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME. SO, NO ANGER. I'M PAST THE
ANGER. >> Reporter: HE SAID GETTING TO SEE HIS LATE FRIEND'S JOHN'S WORK STAND AS A STAPLE OF THE
LEAGUE ONCE AGAIN WILL BE SPECIAL.
>> WOULD NOT FEEL RIGHT IF REPO AGAIN. THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD. >> OUR THANKS TO DEREK FROM OUR
WICHITA AFFILIATE FOR THAT REPORT. >>> THAT WILL DO IT FOR THIS HOUR OF MORNING NEWS NOW BUT
THE NEWS CONTINUES RIGHT NOW.
>>> GOOD MORNING. I AM STEVEN ROMO. RIGHT NOW ON MORNING NEWS NOW, POLITICAL SUCKER PUNCH.
BEHIND CLOSED DOOR BOMBSHELL REPORTED BY "THE WASHINGTON POST" THAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE J.D. VANCE ADMITTED TO DONORS AND A
NEW RECORDING. HOW CONCERNED HE IS ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS ENTERING THE RACE.
IT COMES IS A FORMER PRESIDENT STRONGLY DEFENDED HIS PICK FOR VICE PRESIDENT'S CONTROVERSY SURGES OVER HIS PAST REMARKS.
>> HE'S GOT TREMENDOUS SUPPORT AMONG A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO LIKE FAMILIES.
>> THE LATEST FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS ANOTHER BIG POLITICAL NAME STEPS BACK FROM THE HIS
CAMPAIGN. >>> ALSO, THE GROWING DEVASTATION FROM ONE OF THE
LARGEST WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES TORCHED IN A MATTER OF DAYS. DOZENS OF HOMES REDUCED TO
RUBBLE. ON THE GROUND WITH THE LATEST EFFORTS TO CONTAIN IT AS HARROWING STORIES OF SURVIVAL
ARE NOT COMING TO LIGHT. >>> NOT LOVING IT? McDONALD'S REPORTING A SALES SLUMP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
YEARS AS HUNGRY CUSTOMERS SOUND OFF, FED UP WITH FAST FOOD AND RISING PRICES.
COULD THAT SPELL GOOD NEWS FOR YOUR WALLET? WE WILL DIG INTO THOSE NUMBERS. >>> A QUESTION THAT'S BEEN ON
THE MINDS OF PHILOSOPHERS AND FANS ALIKE FOR DECADES. WHEN IN HISTORY WILL WE BE ABLE TO CASH A ICONIC FLAVOR SLAVE
AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES? THAT HAS BEEN ANSWERED THIS YEAR IN PARIS AND IT COMES WITH A SPECIAL NEW TITLE FOR TEAM USA'S WATER POLO SQUAD.
WE WILL EXPLAIN, COMING UP LATER. >>> WE BEGIN WITH THE RACE FOR
THE WHITE HOUSE AS FRONT RUNNER FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION, VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS IS SET TO CAMPAIGN IN ATLANTA.
GEORGIA IS A CRUCIAL STATE THAT HARRIS IS LOOKING TO KEEP BLUE AFTER JOE BIDEN NEARLY ONE IT IN 2020.
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS RALLYING BEHIND HIS NEW RUNNING MATE, HELLO SENATOR J.D. VANCE FOLLOWING CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS HE HAS PREVIOUSLY MADE
THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT. SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT
AND NBC NEWS NOW WINKER, HALLIE JACKSON, IS THE LATEST FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE
WILL PROBABLY END UP DEBATING VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT COMMIT TO IT AS HARRIS PREPARES TO GO TO
THE SWING STATE OF GEORGIA TODAY, GETTING READY TO CEMENT A RUNNING MATE AS TRUMP DEFENDS HIS. THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE TAKING SHAPE THIS MORNING WITH VICE
PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS SET TO HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A NEW
INTERVIEW BACKING UP HIS NEW RUNNING MATE, J.D. VANCE.
>> HE HAS TREMENDOUS SUPPORT AMONG A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE. PEOPLE THAT LIKE FAMILIES. >> Reporter: THE FORMER
PRESIDENT REFERENCING THE COMMENTS FROM 2021. CRITICAL OF DEMOCRATS WITHOUT CHILDREN. >> WE ARE RUN IN THIS COUNTRY
VIA THE DEMOCRATS AND CORPORATE OLIGARCHS BY BUNCH OF CHILDLESS CAT LADIES.
>> HE LOVES FAMILY. >> Reporter: TRUMP INSISTING
THAT WHEN HE TOLD THE CHRISTIAN AUDIENCE FRIDAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO VOTE IN FOUR YEARS, HE WAS
NOT ALLUDING TO THE END OF ELECTIONS IF HE WINS AS DEMOCRATS HAVE SUGGESTED.
>> IS SET TO THE CHRISTIANS, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE.
YOU HAVE TO VOTE ON NOVEMBER 5. AFTER THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT VOTING ANYMORE. WE ARE GOING TO FIX AND THE COUNTRY WILL BE FIXED.
>> Reporter: THE FORMER PRESIDENT SUGGESTING HE MAY BE READY TO DEBATE VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS. >> I WANT TO DEBATE.
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS. SHE'S A RADICAL LEFT-WING LUNATIC. >> Reporter: HARRIS SAID SHE'S READY TO DEBATE MR. TRUMP.
FOR HER PART, THE VICE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSING ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, LINKING
TRUMP TO THE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON ABORTION IN IOWA AFTER SIX WEEKS. >> IOWA THE 22nd STAY DONALD TRUMP ABORTION BAN.
>> Reporter: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, J.D. VANCE SAYING RUNNING AGAINST HARRIS INSTEAD OF PRESIDENT
BIDEN WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A POLITICAL SUCKER PUNCH ACCORDING TO A REPORTING
OBTAINED BY "THE WASHINGTON POST". VANCE ADDING HARRIS IS YOUNGER AND NOT STRUGGLING IN THE SAME
WAY PRESIDENT BIDEN DID. A SPOKESPERSON SAID HARRIS' FAR
LEFT IDEAS ARE EVEN MORE RADIOACTIVE THAN JOE BIDEN'S. HARRIS IS SET TO DECIDE ON A RUNNING MATE BY THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK AND THIS MORNING, ONE MAJOR CONTENDER OUT. NORTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR ROY
COOPER WITHDRAWING HIS NAME FROM CONSIDERATION OVERNIGHT. AS FOR WHERE THE REST OF THE HEAP STAKES STAND, TOP
CONTENDERS, JOSH SHAPIRO WHO
RALLIED FOR HARRIS IN THE KEY BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA MONDAY ALONG WITH GRETCHEN WHITMER WHO SUGGESTED SHE PREFERS TO STAY IN THE
GOVERNOR'S MANSION. ALSO, MINNESOTA TIM WALZ, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY PETE
BUTTIGIEG AND MARK KELLY OF ARIZONA. THAT'S NOTABLE SINCE A TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN TARGETING
HARRIS ON IMMIGRATION. THE CAMPAIGN CALLS ITS FIRST MAJOR TV AD BY SINCE HARRIS
ENTERED THE RACE, AND IT'S ON THAT TOPIC OF THE BORDER AND IMMIGRATION.
>> CHANGES KEEP COMING. >>> AS WE MENTIONED, VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS IS HEADING TO
GEORGIA AND WE CANNOT FORGET HOW IMPORTANT BLACK VOTERS WERE IN PROPELLING JOE BIDEN TO WIN
IN THAT STATE FOUR YEARS AGO. HIM HE SHALL SEND HER SPOKE TO A GROUP OF BLACK MEN ABOUT HOW
THE SHAKEUP IN THE ELECTION COULD IMPACT THEIR VOTE. >> Reporter: IN BATTLEGROUND
GEORGIA, BLACK MEN VOTERS WILL BE CRITICAL IN THE RACE TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
>> I LIKE RFK >> Reporter: THEY ARE BOTH 32-
YEAR-OLD SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. SAMUEL IS AN INDEPENDENT. HOW WILL HARRIS BEING THE TOP OF THE TWO BIG IMPACT THE WAY
YOU SEE THE ELECTION? >> HER AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET MADE ME THINK ABOUT CREATING A HISTORIC MOMENT, NOT JUST FOR THE COUNTRY BUT FOR THE -- AS A
WHOLE. I THINK A LOT SHE HAS TO PROVE. THERE'S A LOT OF MAN IN THE
COUNTRY WHO NEED TO BE OKAY WITH ANOTHER WOMAN LEADING THE
COUNTRY. >> Reporter: GRIFFIN IS A REPUBLICAN AND HE SAYS HE IS STILL VOTING FOR TRUMP.
TELL ME WHAT APPEALS TO YOU ABOUT TRUMP? >> HIS BUSINESS ACUMEN.
WE WERE DOING BETTER FINANCIALLY WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT. HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A BUSINESS ICON. >> Reporter: HE HAD THIS TO SAY
ABOUT HARRIS. >> I THINK SHE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING. >> Reporter: WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE HARRIS ACCOMPLISH THAT YOU HAVE NOT? >> I WOULD'VE LIKED FOR HER TO
BRING CALM TO THE BORDER. IT'S GOTTEN OUT OF HAND. >> Reporter: IN 2020, PRESIDENT
BIDEN NEARLY FLIPPED GEORGIA BLUE WINNING BY UNDER 12,000 VOTES.
DEMOCRAT SAID HE'S EXCITED FOR HARRIS. >> I'VE NEVER SEEN ENTHUSIASM
LIKE THIS IS FAST. >> Reporter: YOU HAD CONCERNS ABOUT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS'
BACKGROUND AS A PROSECUTOR. WHAT GOT YOU OVER THAT? >> WHEN I STARTED DOING THE RESEARCH.
IT RESONATES. >> Reporter: ALL THREE MEN ARE WAITING FOR THE NOVEMBER
ELECTION RESULTS.
>>> IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, ONE OF THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN STATE HISTORY IS STILL GROWING AT A RAPID PACE. DEVASTATED FAMILIES ARE
RETURNING TO FIND HOMES TURNED TO ASH. STEVE PATTERSON IS IN CHICO, CALIFORNIA WITH THE LATEST.
>> Reporter: THE FIRE WILL NOT
STOP GROWING. LESS THAN A WEEK, 370,000 ACRES, THE LARGEST ACTIVE
WILDFIRE BURNING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE SIXTH LARGEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. FIREFIGHTERS BATTLING THE PARK
FIRE, HOPING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF COLDER WEATHER TO INCREASE
CONTAINMENT OF THIS MASSIVE BLAZE. THOUSANDS ARE UNDER EVACUATION ORDERS AND DOZENS OF HOMES
DESTROYED ALONG WITH COUNTLESS CLOSE CALLS. >> FAMILY AND FRIENDS, YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE.
I DECIDED TO STAY AND HAD A COUPLE PEOPLE WITH ME. WE KNOW IT WOULD BE BAD BUT WE DIDN'T
KNOW HOW BAD. >> Reporter: THE MAN ACCUSED TO START IN THE WILDFIRE APPEARING IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME,
FACING FELONY ARSON CHARGES. IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA, THE 53,000 ACRE CORRAL FIRE
LEVELING THIS HISTORIC MINING TOWN. NEARLY TRIPPING TWO SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES.
>> WE HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED BY FIRE. >> Reporter: THANKFULLY, THE OFFICERS SURVIVED.
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, MUCH OF THE BURNED ZONE COVERS AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY WILDFIRES INCLUDING PARADISE, CALIFORNIA, WHERE 85 PEOPLE
DIED IN 2018. AMID THE DEVASTATION, MOMENTS OF JOY.
THESE PUPPIES AND THEIR MOTHER STUCK WHEN THEIR OWNER'S TRUCK WERE RESCUED BY THE SHERIFFS. A SMALL VICTORY AS THE WAR
AGAINST WILDFIRES REACHES AN.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WEATHER HAS BEEN COOPERATIVE FOR FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE ALSO MAKING PROGRESS ON FIRE CONTAINMENT.
NOW UP TO 14% AND THEY ARE PUSHING AWAY POPULATION CENTERS
AND AWAY FROM THIS CITY AND THE TOWN OF PARADISE.
THERE IS MORE HOT, DRY WEATHER IN THE FORECAST FURTHER ELEVATING THE FIRE DANGER AND A DANGEROUS FIREFIGHT.
STATIC METEOROLOGIST AND -- ANGIE LASSMAN JOINS US. >>> WE HAVE RAIN TO TALK ABOUT
AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT AS A COLD FRONT WORKS ITS WAY TO THE EAST. THESE ARE SPOTS WE'RE SEEING RAIN.
NOTICE PARTS OF THE MIDWEST, OHIO VALLEY, BUT WE HAVE A FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY IN PARTS OF VERMONT.
CALEDONIA COUNTY WE HAVE SEEN AMPLE AMOUNTS OF RAIN AND WASHED OUT ROADS.
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND THAT RAIN IS MOVING OUT BUT THEY HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF RAIN IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.
IS MORE WAY RAIN ON THE WAY. MAINE TO FLORIDA, SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND STORMS TODAY.
A COUPLE MORE ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDWEST AS WE WATCH US COLD FRONT WORK TO THE EAST. AS WE GET INTO TOMORROW, ONCE
AGAIN THE SAME UNSETTLED BEHAVIOR. THUNDERSTORMS FOCUSED ACROSS PARTS OF NEW ENGLAND AND MID
ATLANTIC. THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT TOMORROW, SEVERE RISK WILL BE LOW BUT WE WILL HAVE THE HEAVY RAIN THREAT. TODAY, A BIG CHUNK OF THE
COUNTRY UNDER THE SEVERE RISK. 18 MILLION FROM OMAHA TO DES MOINES THROUGH ST. LOUIS AND
EXTENDING FURTHER TO THE NORTH IN PARTS OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS. THE BIGGEST THING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS STRONG
WINDS. THAT'S THE MAIN THREAT.
THE GREATEST CHANCE OF HAPPENING, WIND GUSTS OVER 75 MILES PER HOUR. WILL NOT RULE OUT HAIL
POTENTIALLY, ISOLATED TORNADO. THE HEAVY RAIN WILL BE THERE. NOTICE THE SLIGHT RISK OF FLASH
FLOODING FROM DES MOINES TO KNOXVILLE, CHATTANOOGA, SOME OF
THE SAME AREAS THEY COULD SEE STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL. AN INCH TO 2 INCHES ARE UP TO
THREE INCHES. HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE TROPICS? THEY'VE BEEN A LITTLE QUIET BUT
WE ARE FAR FROM DONE. IT'S FAR FROM OVER. ALL THE WAY TO NOVEMBER AND WE
HAVE A 50% CHANCE OF THIS TROPICAL DEPRESSION POTENTIALLY DEVELOPING BY THE END OF THE WEEK.
THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS SO WE WON'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THIS HOW THIS PLAYS OUT BUT WE
WILL KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON A. LOOKING AT THE DEVELOP MOVES ON ACROSS PARTS OF THE CARIBBEAN AND UP THE COAST OF FLORIDA POTENTIALLY THROUGH THE NEXT
WEEK OR SO. MEANWHILE, THE OLYMPICS, THAT'S BEEN WHAT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON. LOOK AT TEMPERATURES IN PARIS. 100 DEGREES, EXTREME HEAT.
THIS WILL LIKELY IMPACT SOME SPORTS. VOLLEYBALL AND EQUESTRIAN.
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES LIKELY GOING TO SEE REALLY WARM TEMPERATURES WITH FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURES 110.
LATE AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND STORMS OUT THERE AS WELL AND THEY COULD LAST INTO THE EVENING. THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS THERE, THINGS GET BETTER. TEMPERATURES GETTING BACK TO CLOSER TO NEAR AVERAGE RANGE
THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK.
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WE WILL GET RID OF THE RAIN AND HAVE A LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE FOR FOLKS COMPETING AND FOLKS ENJOYING THE OLYMPICS THERE. >> HOPEFULLY THEY HELD ONTO THE
CLEAR PONCHOS THEY WERE USING DURING THE CEREMONIES.
>>> TURNING TO THE MIDDLE EAST WERE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS ARE INTENSIFYING THEIR TO TRY TO DE- ESCALATE TENSION BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HEZBOLLAH.
LEBANON -- THEY SAID IT WOULD RESPOND TO A ROCKET STRIKE ON
THE ISRAEL CONTROLLED: HEIGHTS THAT KILLED 12 YOUNG PEOPLE. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT RAF
SANCHEZ JOINS US WITH MORE ON THIS. WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THIS ONGOING EFFORT THAT WE HAVE
HEARD ABOUT TO STOP THE CONFLICT FROM SPREADING DEEPER INTO LEBANON, AND HOW LIKELY IS
THIS MAJOR ISRAELI ATTACK NOW? >> Reporter: WE SAW THE ISRAELI
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ON THE GOLAN HEIGHTS YESTERDAY.
HE WENT TO VISIT THE SOCCER FIELD WHERE THE 12 KIDS WERE KILLED IN WHAT ISRAEL SAYS WAS A ROCKET STRIKE CARRIED OUT BY IRANIAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH MILITANTS.
THE PRIME MINISTER BOWS THERE WILL BE A SEVERE RESPONSE.
WE DON'T YET KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE, BUT ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS IS, WILL NETANYAHU GET THE ISRAELI MILITARY THE ORDER TO ATTACK BEIRUT, THE CAPITOL OF LEBANON.
THAT IS SOMETHING HE HAS REFRAINED FROM DOING OVER THESE LAST 9.5 MONTHS OF WAR BUDDIES UNDER MAJOR PRESSURE FROM THE FAR RIGHT OF HIS GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY.
THE U.S. IS SAYING IT SUPPORTS ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO RETALIATE BUT IT'S COUNSELING RESTRAINT.
WE KNOW IT'S BEEN ACTING AS A GO-BETWEEN, ISRAELI GOVERNMENT, LEBANESE GOVERNMENT AND BY EXTENSION HEZBOLLAH TRYING TO
DEATH WE DON'T END UP IN A CYCLE OF ESCALATION THAT LEADS
TO ALL-OUT WAR. >> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT ANOTHER BIG STORY OUT OF ISRAEL WE ARE FOLLOWING.
WE UNDERSTAND NINE ISRAELI SOLDIERS EXPECTED OF ABUSING A
PALESTINIAN PRISONER WILL BE IN COURT TODAY. YESTERDAY, BACKLASH FROM PROTESTERS STORMING TWO
MILITARY BASES IN RESPONSE? WALK US THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED
AND THESE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST THE SOLDIERS? >> Reporter: YEAH. THIS WAS A SPASM OF POLITICAL
MOB VIOLENCE WHICH HAS STUNNED MANY LIBERAL ISRAELIS.
YESTERDAY, MILITARY POLICE SHOWED UP AT A NOTORIOUS ISRAELI DETENTION CENTER WHERE PALESTINIAN PRISONERS FROM GAZA
ARE BEING HELD. A CENTER WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN ALLEGATIONS OF TORTURE BY
ISRAELI AUTHORITIES AND THE MILITARY POLICE ARRESTED NINE
SOLDIERS WHO ARE SUSPECTED OF HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN TORTURE, SERIOUS ABUSE, OF ONE
DETAINEE. SHORTLY AFTER THAT, YOU SAW THIS MOB OF RIGHT-WING ACTIVISTS LED BY SOME ISRAELI
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, AND THEY STORM THROUGH THE GATES OF THE FACILITY.
A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER, THE SAME THING HAPPENED. THIS TIME THEY WERE STORMING A
ISRAELI ARMY BASE WHERE THOSE SOLDIERS WERE BEING DETAINED. THIS HAS LED TO WIDESPREAD CONDEMNATION FROM ISRAELI
POLITICAL LEADERS, AND WE SAW THE CHIEF OF STAFF, THE HEAD OF THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAYING
THIS IS BORDERLINE ANARCHY. THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE ISRAELI POLICE WHO DID NOT STOP
THE MOB FROM STORMING INTO THE BASIS. THEY DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE
CARRIED OUT ANY ARREST. IS REAL ZONE DEFENSE MINISTER IS QUESTIONING WHETHER THE FAR RIGHT NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE POLICE, GAVE THEM AN ORDER NOT TO
INTERVENE IN THIS SITUATION. SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OR WHEN THE NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER IS
DENYING BUT IT'S A STUNNED ISRAEL AND BRINGING RENEWED FOCUS ON ALLEGATIONS THAT ISRAELI FORCES MAY HAVE BEEN
TORTURING SOME OF THESE DETAINEES. >> A LOT OF MOVING PARTS IN THE REGION. I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT GUYS AND
THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION. WORSENING YET AGAIN. HEALTH MINISTRY DECLARING A
POLIO EPIDEMIC? THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAID THEY NEED A CEASE-FIRE TO VACCINATE CHILDREN.
TELL US ABOUT THAT AND IS THERE UPDATES ON A POTENTIAL CEASE FIRE? >> Reporter: YEAH, POLIO.
A DISEASE FROM THE EARLY 20th CENTURY. IT IS LARGELY STAMPED OUT ACROSS MUCH OF THE PLAN I. IT
APPEARS, ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, TWO BROKEN OUT IN GAZA BECAUSE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS COMPLETELY COLLAPSED.
KIDS HAVE NOT BEEN GETTING VACCINATIONS. AS THIS POINT, POLIO HAS BEEN
DETECTED IN WASTEWATER. WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT IN ANY ACTIVE PATIENTS. IT'S RAISING A LOT OF CONCERN
ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN DEVASTATED -- CEASE-FIRE.
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN SOUNDING MORE HOPEFUL ABOUT A DEAL. THE CIA DIRECTOR WAS IN ROME
AND MEETING WITH ISRAELI, EGYPTIAN AND QATARI
COUNTERPARTS. IS REAL AND THOMAS ARE BLAMING EACH OTHER AND WE HAVEN'T REACHED A DEAL. THEY ARE ACCUSING THE OTHER TRIED TO MAKE LAST-MINUTE
CHANGES. IT'S MORE COMPLICATED BY TENSIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HEZBOLLAH.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE UPDATES. >>> WE HAVE MORE TO COME THIS HOUR ON MORNING NEWS NOW INCLUDING THE LATEST OUT OF
PARIS. OLYMPIC RACE IN THE STORY, POSTPONED OVER WATER QUALITY
CONCERNS. HOW OFFICIALS AND ATHLETES ARE REACTING TO THIS UNFORTUNATE
DELAY. >>> SIMONE BILES SET TO GO FOR GOLD LATER TODAY.
WE ARE COVER
JAGER EATON, 0.1 AWAY FROM WINNING THE GOLDEN MEN'S SKATEBOARDING. FELLOW AMERICAN FINISHED RIGHT
BEHIND HIM FOR THE BRONZE AS WELL. JAY GRAY IS LIVE IN PARIS WITH US FOR ALL OF THE HEADLINES COMING OUT OF THE OLYMPIC EVENTS
WHICH ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY IN PARIS. GOOD MORNING TO YOU.
THEY WON THEIR FIRST MEDAL IN -- SINCE 2000 A. WE GET TO SEE THE
WOMEN'S TEAM PERFORMED TODAY. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE EXCITEMENT AROUND THESE TWO TEAMS?
>> Reporter: IT IS INCREDIBLE. A BIT OF A SURPRISE.
THE MEN GETTING TO THE MEDAL ROUND AND THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN A DECADE THEN YOU COME OUT WITH THE BRONZE.
FIRST TIME IN 16 YEARS THIS TEAM HAS MEDDLED. SO HAPPY FOR THIS GREAT GROUP
OF GUYS. IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE A FOCUS THEY WERE AND HOW DEDICATED.
THE WOMEN'S TEAM TAKING FROM THAT AS WELL. THEY GO TO THE TEAM FINAL THIS
EVENING. THEY CAME OUT OF QUALIFYING AS THE NUMBER 1 TEAM.
SIMONE BILES, WHAT DO YOU SAY? SHE'S UNBELIEVABLE. SHE SCORED MORE POINTS THAN
OTHER GYMNASTS. DON'T TELL ANYBODY. THIS IS THE LEOTARD THE TEAM
WILL WEAR THIS EVENING. IT'S CALLED GO FOR GLORY.
IT'S MADE IN THE LIKENESS OF BAND AS A TRIBUTE TO THE 1992 OLYMPIC TEAM.
THEY HAD A SIMILAR ONE. THEY WON THE GOLD MEDAL. THE DIFFERENCE IS IT HAS ALMOST 10,000 CRYSTALS.
I KNOW THAT NUMBER BECAUSE I BEDAZZLED IT MYSELF. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DID NOT. IT'S QUITE THE LEOTARD AND THIS IS WHAT THEY WILL WEAR IN A COUPLE OF HOURS. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
HOW THEY DO. THEY ARE A POWERHOUSE. >> I WILL SEND YOU A SUIT
JACKET TO BE DECILE. TEAM USA LEADING ALL NATIONS IN
THE MEDAL COUNT. IS ADDED TO THE LIST? WHERE DO THINGS STAND?
>> Reporter: THE BIG CLIMB IN THE RACE FOR THE MOST MEDALS IS FRANCE.
THEY REALLY JUMPED UP AND THEY ARE SECOND BEHIND TEAM USA. TEAM USA WITH 20 MEDALS TOLD.
A LITTLE LACKING IN GOLD. THREE RIGHT NOW BUT THERE IS A
LOT OF CHANCES THIS EVENING INCLUDING THE WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS TEAM EVENT. EIGHT SILVER AND NINE BRONZE.
FRANCE WITH FIVE GOLD, EIGHT AND THEN THREE. 16.
FOUR MEDAL LEAD. JAPAN AND CHINA AND GREAT BRITAIN AT 12, 12, AND 10.
A SIGNIFICANT LEAD ON THE OTHERS. THE HOME COUNTRY WHICH IS GETTING A TON OF SUPPORT AS THEY
MAKE HEADWAY YESTERDAY. WE HAVE TO GET ON IT TODAY. >> THAT MAKES SENSE, THEIR HOME
TURF. JAY GRAY, THANK YOU. >>> STICKING WITH THE OLYMPICS,
ATHLETES DUE TO COMPETE IN THE SEINE RIVER HAVE TO WAIT DUE
TO CONCERNS OVER WATER QUALITY. THE MEN'S AND WOMEN'S TRIATHLON COMPETITIONS SCHEDULED FOR
WEDNESDAY. THIS AFTER PARIS SPENT $1 BILLION TO CLEAN UP THAT RIVER
AHEAD OF THE SUMMER GAMES.
EVEN THE PARIS MAYOR TAKING A SWIM IN THE RIVER TO SHOW IT WAS CLEAN ENOUGH BEFORE THE OPENING CEREMONY. CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT KEIR SIMMONS
JOINS US FROM THE RIVERBANKS IN PARIS WITH MORE ON THIS. GOOD MORNING.
HOW DO ORGANIZERS COME TO THE DECISION TO MOVE IT TO
WEDNESDAY. COULD IT BE PUSHED BACK FURTHER? >> Reporter: IT COULD BE. LET ME TELL YOU WHERE WE ARE.
WE ARE BEHIND THE SEINE RIVER. THAT'S THE WORLD-FAMOUS BRIDGE.
THERE IS A HISTORIC BUILDING. YOU CAN SEE THOSE EMPTY BLEACHERS. THIS IS THE RIVER WHERE THE
MEN'S TRIATHLON SWIMMING EVENT WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE TODAY. IT DID NOT BECAUSE OF THOSE TESTS OVERNIGHT.
IT WAS TOO HIGH A LEVEL OF BACTERIA IN THE WATER AFTER THE RAIN WE SOUGHT THE OPENING CEREMONY. LET ME READ A STATEMENT THEY SENT THIS MORNING.
DESPITE IMPROVEMENTS ON THE WATER QUALITY LEVELS IN THE LAST HOURS, THE READINGS AT
SOME POINT OF THE SWIM COURSE ARE BOTH ACCEPTABLE LOVERS. THEIR PRIORITY IS THE SAFETY OF
ATHLETES.
THEY COULD NOT DO IT TODAY, BUT THEY'RE HOPING TO DO IT TOMORROW MAYBE ANOTHER DAY. >> IT WILL BE -- IF THEY DO IT,
AND YOU SPOKE TO ATHLETES ABOUT THE TRIATHLON AND ABOUT IT
BEING PUSHED BACK. HOW ARE THEY RESPONDING TO THIS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE RACE? >> Reporter: WE SPOKE TO ONE OF
THE MEMBERS OF TEAM USA TRIATHLON TEAM. IT IS INTERESTING.
SHE SAYS SHE IS PREPARED TO RACE WHEN SHE CAN RAISE.
ACTUALLY, TALKS ABOUT AT THE SWIMMING IN A RIVER LIKE THIS
IS ABOUT NAVIGATING OCCURRENCE IN THE WATERS. IT'S PART OF THE SPORT. YOU CAN'T JUST GO TO A SWIMMING
POOL. INEVITABLY, WHEREVER THERE RAISING, THERE TIMES WHEN THEY CANNOT RAISE ON A DATE BECAUSE
IT'S NOT SAFE ENOUGH FOR THERE'S OTHER ISSUES. THAT IS PART OF IT SO IT SEEMS IN A SENSE, IF YOU LIKE, IT'S
PART AND PARCEL TO WHAT IT IS TO BE A TRIATHLETE. IT'S A LITTLE LIKE PLAYING CHESS IN THE WATER.
YOU DON'T SWIM IN A STRAIGHT LINE. YOU HAVE TO MOVE AROUND THE
WATER TO FIND YOUR WAY THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. THAT'S PART OF THE FUN. >> I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE ABLE
TO TAKE A DIP IN THE SEINE RIVER? IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL BEHIND YOU . >> Reporter: I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU CAN SEE HOW CLEAN IT IS. I DID NOT JUMP IN HERE.
IT IS HOT AND I WOULD BUT WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO.
WE FOUND ONE PLACE WHERE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SWIM IN PARIS RIGHT NOW. IT WAS YESTERDAY.
SO FAR SO GOOD. >> GOOD TO HEAR. WE WILL KEEP CHECKING IN JUST
IN CASE YOU END UP NEEDING ANTIBIOTICS.
>> Reporter: NOW TO THE UNREST HAPPENING IN VENEZUELA. THERE'S MAJOR PROTEST ROCKING THE COUNTRY AFTER THE PRESIDENT
CLAIMED VICTORY IN THE DISPUTED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. IS OPPOSITION RIVAL ALSO
CLAIMED VICTORY. POLICE USED RUBBER BULLETS AND TEAR GAS TO TRY TO DISPERSE THE
DEMONSTRATORS. DAVID NORIEGA HAS MORE THAN THE POLITICAL TURMOIL WHICH IS
UNFOLDING. >> Reporter: OUTRAGE ACROSS VENEZUELA AFTER PRESIDENT MADURO CLAIMED VICTORY IN HIS
THIRD STRAIGHT ELECTION. THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL
ANNOUNCING MADURO SECURED 51% COMPARED TO THE OPPOSITION CANDIDATE WITH 44%.
HE AND THE OPPOSITION CLAIMING VICTORY SAYING THEY RECEIVED 70% OF THE VOTE.
MADURO'S GOVERNMENT REFUSING TO RELEASE THE DETAILS , OFFICIAL RESULTS TO BACK UP ITS CLAIMED A VICTORY.
HE CLAIMED SOMEONE HACKED THE
NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. >> THIS REPORTER IS IN CARACAS
WAR PROTESTERS HAS STARTED TAKING TO THE STREETS. >> WE ARE LOOKING AT THE PEOPLE WITHOUT ANYONE TELLING THEM,
THEY ARE -- AT LEAST RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT WILL GET
BIGGER. THE PEOPLE ARE SHOWING,
CELEBRATION. >> Reporter: ALSO CASTING DOUBT
ON THE ELECTION OUTCOME AND URGING OFFICIALS TO RELEASE A DETAILED TABULATION OF BOTH. >> WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS THE RESULT ANNOUNCED DOES NOT
REFLECT THE WILL OR THE FUNDS FOR THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE. >> Reporter: ACCORDING TO THE U.N., 7 MILLION HAVE LEFT SINCE MADURO LET TOOK AUCTION --
TOOK OFFICE. MANY SING THEY WILL NOT GO HOME.
>> [ SPEAKING IN A GLOBAL LANGUAGE ]
>> Reporter: MADURO TO POWER FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF A POPULAR SOCIALIST LEAGUER --
LEADER. THE ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE UNDER HIS RULE INCLUDING
HYPERINFLATION. HE HAS RECEIVED HARSH CRITICISM FOR HIS AUTOCRATIC RULE FACING ACCUSATIONS OF TAKING PRISONERS
AND NOT ALLOWING FREE ELECTION. >> [ SPEAKING IN A GLOBAL LANGUAGE ]
>> Reporter: DEPOSITION AND THE WAS SAYING HIS LAST ELECTION IN
2018 WAS A LEGITIMATE ONE. FOR NOW, VENEZUELA HEADING INTO APPEARED OF PROFOUND
UNCERTAINTY AS CALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE THE FULL RESULTS GROW LOUDER AND UNREST AMONG CITIZENS GOES LARGE.
THANKS FOR THAT REPORT. >>> STILL TO COME THIS MORNING. COULD A MAJOR PHONE COMPANY BE
HELD LIABLE FOR ACTIONS OF ITS EMPLOYEES? AFTER THE BREAK WE WILL DIG INTO RECENT LAWSUITS FROM SEVERAL
WOMEN ALLEGING WORKERS TOLD INTIMATE IMAGES FROM THEIR DEVICES. WE WILL BRING THE LATEST ON
>> I FEEL GREAT. >>> WEEKNIGHTS AT 8:00 P.M. ON DISH
>>> SEVERAL WOMEN UP AND SUING MAJOR PHONE COMPANIES TO HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. THE LATEST LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN CALIFORNIA YESTERDAY WHERE A
WOMAN SAID AN AT&T EMPLOYEE STOLE NAKED IMAGES FROM HER PHONE DURING AN IN-STORE DATA
TRANSFER. SHE IS NOT THE ONLY ONE. IS SIMILAR LAWSUIT INVOLVING THE
T-MOBILE EMPLOYEE WAS BROUGHT IN WASHINGTON. THE JUDGE IN THE CASE MADE A RULING IN APRIL ALLOWING THE CASE TO CONTINUE AFTER DECIDING
T-MOBILE COULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR ITS EMPLOYEES ACTION. AT&T DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT AND T-MOBILE DECLINED TO COMMENT.
JOINING ME TO BREAK THIS DOWN AS LEGAL ANALYST DANNY CEVALLOS. HOW HAVE COMPANIES BEEN ABLE TO AVOID BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE
FOR THIS IN THE PAST? COULD THIS AFFECT FUTURE CASES? >> T-MOBILE IN THE PHONE
COMPANIES ARGUMENT, WE DIDN'T KNOW THIS EMPLOYEE WAS DOING IT. IT WASN'T SOMETHING WE WANTED THE EMPLOYEE TO DO SO WE SHOULD
BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR ROGUE EMPLOYEES. WHAT THEY DO IN THE STORE EVEN
IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THESE PHONES. IS A CONCEPT CALLED VICARIOUS LIABILITY AND IT GOES LIKE THIS.
GENERALLY SPEAKING, EMPLOYER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THINGS AND APPLY DOES IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE JOB. BUT, IF THE EMPLOYEE COMMITS SOME WRONG IN THE COURSE AND
SCOPE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT, THEN WE DO HOLD EMPLOYERS VICARIOUSLY LIABLE. EVEN THOUGH THE EMPLOYER MAY NOT HAVE INTENDED THE WRONG,
SINCE THE EMPLOYEE WAS ACTING IN THE SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT, THEY CAN BE HELD LIABLE. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN APRIL. THE JUDGE LOOKED AT THE
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN'S ACT WHICH IS ONE OF THE GROUNDS BROUGHT AGAINST THE PHONE COMPANY AND SAID, THE STATUTE ITSELF SAYS NOTHING ABOUT
VICARIOUS LIABILITY. WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT DOES NOT RULE IT OUT SO IT'S POSSIBLE. AT THAT STAGE, DOESN'T MEAN THE PLAINTIFFS WIN.
IN THE MOTION TO DISMISS IT MEANS THE CASE IS ALLOWED TO MOVE FORWARD, AND IT'S A VIABLE
-- >> THIS IS NOT THE ONLY TIME
IT'S HAPPENED. CIVIL LAWSUIT AND POLICE REPORTS A AT&T FACED SIX OTHER ACCUSATIONS OF SIMILAR WRONGDOING AND IT HAPPENED MORE
THAN A DOESN'T ACCUSATIONS AGAINST VERIZON AND T-MOBILE. DOES THIS HISTORY OF THESE
CLAIMS DOESN'T STRENGTHEN THIS CALIFORNIA CASE? >> THE KEY WILL BE HOW A COURT
WILL DECIDE WHETHER WHAT THESE EMPLOYEES DID IS ACTUALLY IN THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF
EMPLOYMENT. THE PHONE COMPANIES HAD THIS ARGUMENT AND IT'S A REASONABLE
ARGUMENT THAT WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACCESS PRIVATE DATA IN ORDER
TO TURN IN PHONES AND GET NEW PHONES. WHAT WE TRAIN THEM TO DO NEVER INVOLVES GOING ON SNAPCHAT FOR EXAMPLE AND DOWNLOADING NEW
DAMAGES AND DISTRIBUTING THEM. AS A PART OF OUR BUSINESS
MODEL. THE PLAINTIFFS RESPONSES, IT MAY NOT BE PART OF YOUR BUSINESS MODEL, BUT THEY ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE PHONES
BECAUSE OF THEIR JOB. THEIR JOB REQUIRES US TO TRUST THEM WITH OUR DATA.
IT'S A SCARY CONCEPT BECAUSE WE ALL TRADE IN PHONES AND WE TRUST THOSE PEOPLE AT THE STORE ARE NOT GOING THROUGH THEM AND TAKING DATA AND GET NUDE PHOTOS
IN THIS EXAMPLE. IT'S A SCARY THING FOR PEOPLE GOING IN.
THE COURTS MIGHT LEAN TOWARDS HOLDING THESE COMPANIES LIABLE IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN NOT TO DESTROY THE TRUST PEOPLE HAVE
. WHO WILL TURN IN THEIR PHONE?
WE WILL HAVE PHONES FROM THE YEAR 2000 IF WE ARE AFRAID TO TURN THEM IN FOR NEW PHONES. >> A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE IT ON THEIR MINDS. >>> COMING UP.
TODAY MARKS 25 YEARS SINCE THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT HIT THEATERS.
IT RAKED IN NEARLY $250 MILLION AT THE BOX OFFICE. NOW, RUMORS OF A REBOOT, THE
ORIGINAL CAST SAY THEY WANT WHAT THEY ARE OWED. WE WILL TALK WITH THEM ON THE FEUD AND THE ICONIC --
>>> A QUARTERLY SALES SLUMP AT
McDONALD'S, SHOCKING THE FAST FOOD SYSTEM. HUNGRY CUSTOMERS FED UP WITH THE SURGE IN COSTS BUT WILL IT
LEAD TO LOWER PRICES AT THAT DRIVE THROUGH?
BRIAN CHEUNG IS OUTSIDE A McDONALD'S AND HE WILL GIVE THE JUICY DETAILS AND HOPEFULLY BRING BACK AND EGG McMUFFIN
>>> WE ARE. WITH THE LATEST ON THE FAST FOOD WARS.
McDONALD'S IS REPORTING A DROP IN SALES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS. THE SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE GOLDEN ARCHES HINTS A
GROWING FRUSTRATION AMONG AMERICANS WITH INFLATION DRIVING PRICES UP.
BUSINESS IN DATA CORRESPONDING BRIAN CHEUNG WITH THE DETAILS
OUTSIDE OF A McDONALD'S. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US? >> Reporter: IF YOU'VE NOTICED THE PRICE TAG ON THESE THINGS
INCREASING, YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE. CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN BULKING AT HIGHER PRICES WHICH IS ONE
REASON McDONALD'S REPORTED A WORSE THAN EXPECTED SECOND
QUARTER PERFORMANCE. THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES SEEING CONSUMERS BULKING AT HIGH PRICES.
WHAT MIGHT BE BAD BOTTOM LINE COULD TRANSFORM INTO MORE SAVINGS FOR NEARLY EVERYONE ELSE.
THIS MORNING, McDONALD'S NOTING CUSTOMERS ARE NOT LOVING THOSE HIGH PRICES. >> $17 FOR THREE FILLET OF FISH
AT McDONALD'S? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? >> Reporter: AS SALES FELL 1%
COMPARED TO THE YEAR BEFORE. THE FIRST TIME STORE SALES HAVE FALLEN GLOBALLY SINCE 2020 WITH FEWER CUSTOMERS SEEKING OUT THE
GOLDEN ARCHES FURTHER FAST FOOD FIX. WHAT ARE CONSUMERS DOING INSTEAD OF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO McDONALD'S?
>> FAST FOOD PRICES ARE GOING UP AND CONSUMERS ARE WATCHING AND SAYING I WON'T GO AS OFTEN AS I
USED TO. >> Reporter: McDONALD'S EXEC SAYING THEY NEED LOW INCOME
CONSUMERS FRUSTRATED BY HIGH MENU PRICES. >> WE EXPECT CUSTOMERS WILL FEEL THE PINCH OF THE ECONOMY
AND HIGHER COST OF LIVING FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS AND IN THIS COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. >> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ONE
DOLLAR CHEESEBURGERS? >> Reporter: McDONALD'S JUMPED
AT THE FAST FOOD WARS ANNOUNCING A FIVE DOLLAR VALUE MEAL INCLUDING CHEESEBURGER, FRIES, McNUGGETS AND A DRINK.
TODAY THE COMPANY PLANS TO EXTEND THE POPULAR PROGRAM THROUGH AUGUST. EARLIER TELLING SAVANNAH THEY'RE TRYING TO RESPOND TO CUSTOMERS. >> DID CONSUMERS FORCE YOUR
HAND BY BEING SET UP? >> CUSTOMERS ARE STRETCHED.
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR McDONALD'S TO BRING THEM OUT TO. >> Reporter: McDONALD'S FEELING THE HEAT FROM COMPETITORS AS WELL. SONIC, BURGER KING AND WENDY'S OFFERING THEIR OWN DEALS AFTER
CUSTOMER TRAFFIC AT FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS FELL 2% THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR COMPARED TO A
YEAR AGO. >> THEY WILL DO MORE DISCOUNTS THE REST OF THE YEAR. THERE'S NOT ANY QUESTION WE ARE
IN FOR A PROLONGED VALUE WAR IN THE U.S. RESTAURANT BUSINESS. PARTICULARLY FAST FOOD CHAINS.
>> Reporter: WE DID REACH OUT TO McDONALD'S AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD BEYOND WHAT THEY TOLD INVESTORS ON THE
EARNINGS CALL. THEY SAID THEY HAD A POSITIVE REACTION TO THE FIVE DOLLAR MEAL DEAL SO FAR, AND THEY
ANNOUNCE MOST LOCATIONS IT WILL BE EXTENDED THROUGH AUGUST. EVEN THOUGH THE DAYS OF DOLLAR MENUS ARE GONE, YOU CAN PROBABLY SCORE A DEAL THROUGH
THE END OF SUMMER. >> SOMETHING TO WATCH OUT FOR. >>> TODAY MARKS THE 25 YEARS
SINCE ONE OF THE MOST ICONIC HORROR FILMS IN HISTORY WAS RELEASED IN THEATERS WORLDWIDE. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT IS CREDITED FOR DRIVING A MAJOR SHIFT IN THE PROJECTOR FOR
FILMS. THE MOVIE BROKE RECORDS FOR BEING THE HIGHEST GROSSING INDIE FILM AFTER HIS 1999
RELEASE RAKING IN MORE THAN $250 MILLION AGAINST ESTIMATED
$500,000 BUDGET. NOW THEY WANT TO REBOOT THE
FRANCHISE WITH NEW ACTORS AN HONOR THE 25th ANNIVERSARY. THE ORIGINAL CASTING NOT SO FAST.
THEY WANT THE PRODUCTION COMPANY TO PAY RETROACTIVE RESIDUALS FOR THE ROLES IN THE FILM AND FRANCHISE ALLEGEDLY
THEY SAY THEY WERE PAID NEXT TO NOTHING FOR THEIR WORK AND HAVE NOT BEEN CONSULTED ABOUT THE FUTURE PROJECTS DESPITE BEING
FEATURED IN SOME OF THE PROMOTIONS. WE REACHED OF HER COMMENTS BUT HAVE NOT HEARD BACK.
>>> ONE OF THE ORIGINAL STARS OF THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT PLAYED A FICTIONALIZED VERSION OF HIMSELF JOINS ME NOW. MICHAEL, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
I WAS PROBABLY WAY TOO YOUNG WHEN I SAW IT AND I DIDN'T FIND OUT YOU WERE PLAYING A FICTIONALIZED VERSION OF
YOURSELF. I AM GLAD YOU ARE OKAY. WOULD YOU MIND SHARING HOW MUCH YOU PREPAID 25 YEARS AGO AND
WALK US THROUGH WHAT YOU AND YOUR OTHER COSTARS ARE ASKING FOR?
>> APPRECIATE YOUR HAVING ME ON. I WILL LET YOU KNOW THAT OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR FOR FIVE YEARS WE WERE PAID ABOUT
$300,000 FOR THE FIRST FILM. IT WAS A NONUNION FILM WHICH
WAS PART OF THE ISSUE, AND IN THIS DAY, CONTRACTS FOR SMALL
INDEPENDENT FILMS THEY DID NOT HAVE BACK THEN. THE MOVIE REPORTEDLY MADE $372
MILLION AND TO BE HONEST, IF THERE WERE NO FRANCHISE HAPPENING AFTER THE FIRST FILM, WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T TAKE ISSUE
WITH IT. THE PROBLEM IS THEY USE OUR NAME AND FACES IN MARKETING THE FILM, PRESS RELEASES THAT CAME
UP FOR THE NEW FILM, WE FIND OUT ABOUT IT THE DAY THE PUBLIC FINDS OUT WITH OUR FACES ALL
OVER MEDIA. IT HAS HAPPENED TIME AND TIME AGAIN OVER THE YEARS. THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT RIGHT
NOW. WE ARE FACED WITH BEING PART OF A CONGLOMERATE THAT WE NEVER SIGNED ON FOR.
I KNOW THAT'S PART OF DOING BUSINESS.
WE WISH THEY HAD DONE BUSINESS BETTER THAN THEY HAD IN 1999. >> I KNOW THERE BEEN A COUPLE
SEQUELS ALREADY THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED. DID LIONS GATE MAKE CONTACT WITH YOU OVER THE YEARS?
>> WE HAVEN'T HAD CONTACT WITH THEM.
THEN WHEN WE WENT PUBLIC IN APRIL. >> APART FROM WHAT YOU'RE
ASKING FOR LIONSGATE, THERE IS
THE BLAIR WITCH GRANT THAT WOULD GIVE $60,000 TO AN ASPIRING FILM MAKER TO TRY TO PRODUCE THEIR FIRST PROJECT.
HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU AND YOUR TWO COSTARS?
>> I APPRECIATE YOU ASKING ABOUT THE GRANT. THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. WE WANT TO SUPPORT YOUNG
ARTISTS AND WE THINK STUDIOS COULD DO A BETTER JOB OF SUPPORTING YOUNG ARTISTS WITHOUT SKIN IN THE GAME. THE GRANT WOULD MEAN $60,000
ANNUALLY TO YOUNG ARTISTS TRYING TO MAKE A FILM WHERE
LIONSGATE WOULD SEE NO BACK END OF THE FILM. A GENEROUS GESTURE FROM A COMPANY THAT HAS MADE MILLIONS
UPON MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IT WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUNG ARTISTS TO BE CREATIVE AND VALUE
ON UNKNOWNS. >> IT'S BEEN 25 YEARS SINCE THE
DEBUT OF THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON IT NOW,
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUNG FILMMAKERS, ACTORS, JUST GETTING STARTED IN THEIR
CAREERS? >> I AM GRATEFUL TO HAVE BEEN PART OF A. IT WAS A BLESSING OVERALL AND TWO THINGS CAN BE
TRUE. YOU CAN BE GRATEFUL AND YOU CAN LOOK BACK AND SAY, IT DIDN'T GO
THE WAY MAYBE IT SHOULD HAVE HAD WE DONE BUSINESS A LITTLE BETTER.
THAT'S ON OUR PART AND THEIR PART I WOULD ARGUE. THE LAST 25 YEARS, WAS AN ACTOR FOR 15 YEARS AND THEN I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL AND BECAME A SCHOOL COUNSELOR. I WORK WITH MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS
AND I HAVE A STUDIO WHERE I TEACH ACTING, HIGH SCHOOL,
MIDDLE SCHOOL, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. MY WIFE AND I DIRECT PLAYS AT THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL AND WE
MET THERE. WE ARE GIVING BACK AND OF THE
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, STARTED WRITING A BOOK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE BLAIR WITCH
PROJECT. DOING THE CREATIVE THING. I AM STILL ACTING AND HAVE
INDEPENDENT FILMS COMING THIS FALL. I STILL HAVE MY CARD.
I WISH I HAD IT IN 1999 BUT THAT WAS NOT A REALITY THEN. LIFE IS GOOD. I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS.
I AM GRATEFUL FOR WHAT I HAVE BUT WE NEED TO ADVOCATE FOR YOUNG ARTISTS AND ACTORS WHO MAY FIND THEMSELVES IN THIS
SITUATION. >> I AM GLAD YOU ARE DOING WELL AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE BOOK WILL BE A FASCINATING READ. THANK YOU FOR SHARING WITH US.
CHECK COMING UP. WE ARE HEADING BACK TO PARIS WITH OUR CONTINUING COVERAGE OF THE SUMMER GAMES. AFTER THE BREAK, A ONE-ON-ONE CONVERSATION WITH TEAM USA'S NEWEST MAN FOR THE WOMEN'S
WATER POLO TEAM. THE ONE AND ONLY FLAVOR FLAV.
>>> WE WILL JET WITH A SWIMMING STAR FRESH OFF HER BRONZE MEDAL WIN IN THE WOMEN'S INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY. SHE JOINS US, NEXT. NEWS FOR T
NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. >>> A FINISH FOR TEAM USA IN
THE WOMEN'S 400 METER INDIVIDUAL MEDLEY. KATIE GRIMES AND EMMA TOOK HOME THE SILVER AND BRONZE MEDALS IN
THE FINAL. THIS MORNING WE ARE LUCKY TO BE JOINED BY THE BRONZE MEDALIST HERSELF.
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW EXCITING THAT IS. NOW THAT YOU HAVE TIME TO PROCESS, HOW ARE YOU FEELING THIS MORNING? >> I AM REALLY EXCITED. I GOT
TO SEE MY FAMILY A LITTLE LAST NIGHT. >> I AM GLAD YOU WERE ABLE TO
BE THERE WITH YOUR FAMILY DURING ALL OF THIS. EMMA, THE LAST 100 METERS YOU
WERE NECK AND NECK WITH THE BRITISH SWIMMER. HOW -- DID YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE YOU ACTUALLY WORK AND HOW WERE
YOU ABLE TO KICK IT INTO GEAR AND END UP ON THE PODIUM?
>> I TRIED TO SWIM MY OWN RACE. I HAVE TO TRUST, AND PUT MY
HEAD DOWN. >> I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO ASK A SWIMMER.
ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION TO YOUR LOCATION AND WHO'S EITHER
SIDE OF YOU OR ARE YOU FOCUSING ON GOING AS FAST AS YOU CAN? >> A LITTLE OF BOTH. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON.
STAYING TRUE TO MY RACE PLAN IS THEY KEY. >> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU LOCKED IN
A WHAT TO DO. IT'S NOT YOUR FIRST OLYMPIC MEDAL. YOU TOOK HOME THE SILVER IN THE
SAME EVENT IN THE TOKYO GAMES. HOW DID THIS EXPERIENCE COMPARED TO TOKYO? >> I WOULD SAY THE CROWDS MAKES
THIS NEXT LEVEL, HAVING THAT ATMOSPHERE AND THE ENERGY, IT'S MORE FUN.
TOKYO, I AM EXCITED.
>> WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON TOKYO,
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE LIKE BEING IN PARIS? ARE THE CROWDS DIFFERENT? HOW IS THE TYPE?
>> IN TOKYO WE ONLY HAD TEAMMATES WHICH WAS AWESOME THAT THEY DID WHAT THEY DID. HAVING FAMILY MEMBERS AND THE
FRENCH HOME CROWD IS SO MUCH FUN. >> SEEMS LIKE THE FRENCH ARE
SCREAMING FOR EVERYBODY IN THE STANDS. I MENTIONED EARLIER, YOUR
FELLOW TEAM USA SWIMMER KATIE
GRIMES WON THE SILVER MEDAL. HAS SPECIAL IS SET TO END ON THE PODIUM WITH YOUR TEAMMATE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU? >> IT WAS SO SPECIAL.
SHE STARTED GETTING EMOTIONAL. THAT MADE ME EMOTIONAL.
ADDING TO THAT MEDAL COUNT -- >> HAVE YOU MADE PLANS YET?
HOW WILL YOU CELEBRATE WHEN YOU GET HOME? >> AT THE END OF THIS MEET, WE
WILL GET TOGETHER. >> THAT WILL BE EXCITING.
YOU HAVE COMPETED IN PARIS, TOKYO, ANY PLANS FOR L.A.
COMING UP IN FOUR YEARS? >> YOU NEVER KNOW. I WILL GO FROM THERE.
I'M GRATEFUL. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR
TIME. >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. >>> YOU MAY KNOW HIM AS A COFOUNDER OF THE HIP-HOP GROUP
PUBLIC ENEMY OR MAYBE FROM ENEMAS MANY REALITY SHOWS.
THESE DAYS, FLAVOR FLAV IS MAKING WAVES AT THE PARIS OLYMPICS. TOM LLAMAS REPORTS HE IS DOING
SO WITH A VERY SPECIAL. >> FLAVOR FLAV, WHAT MORE CAN I
SAY . ALL I CAN SAY IS USA. >> Reporter: LEGENDARY RAPPER
FLAVOR FLAV TAKING HIS TALENTS TO PARIS.
>> USA. >> Reporter: IS THE-MAN FOR TEAM USA'S WOMEN'S WATER POLO
TEAM AND WHILE HE IS HERE WE HAD A CHANCE TO MEET UP WITH HIM. SPENT WHAT IS UP? HOW ARE YOU DOING?
>> Reporter: YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS, WHAT IF WE GOT? >> THIS IS MY SPECIAL, ONE OF
MY SPECIAL WATER POLO CLOCKS. >> Reporter: IS A WATERPROOF? >> IT IS WATERPROOF AND IT'S A
SHOWER CLOCK. >> Reporter: HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED WITH WATER POLO? >> THEY ARE WORKING ONE, TWO OR
THREE JOBS. THEY ARE BUSTING THEIR BUTTS MAKING THE UNITED STATES LOOK GOOD.
I SAID TO MYSELF, THIS WOULDN'T BE BAD TO HELP THESE GIRLS OUT.
>> HE SIGNED A FIVE-YEAR SPONSORSHIP DEAL WITH THE TEAM AFTER HE RESPONDED TO AN INSTAGRAM POST BY ONE OF THE
ATHLETES WERE SHE ASKED FOR FINANCIAL HELP GETTING THE TEAM TO THE SUMMER GAMES. >> THESE GIRLS, THEY HAVE BACK
TO BACK TO BACK GOLD MEDALS. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
I KNOW IT WAS NOT EASY. I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES NOW.
TO PLAY WATER POLO. YOU KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING? >> DO YOU HAVE YOUR SPEEDO
READY? >> Reporter: TEAM INVITED HIM TO ONE OF THE FINAL PRACTICES
AT BERKELEY. >> ARE YOU READY?
>> Reporter: EVEN GIFTING HIM HIS OWN PERSONALIZED SWIM CAP. >> USA. >> Reporter: WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE WATER,
IT'S LIKE 7.5 FEET DEEP. SOME 15 FEET DEEP.
THEY ARE TREADING WATER THE WHOLE TIME. >> Reporter: TRYING TO CATCH THE BALL.
>> THEY ARE TREADING WATER. WHEN I JUMPED IN AND I WAS
TREADING WATER FOR 7.5 MINUTES, IT WAS THE HARDEST SEVEN MINUTES I EVER SPENT IN THE WATER IN MY LIFE.
>> Reporter: DID YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT WATER POLO WAS? >> THE ONLY WAY I KNEW WAS WHAT I SAW ON TV. >> Reporter: HOW WILL IS YOUR
OLYMPIC EXPERIENCE GOING? >> THIS IS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE. >> Reporter: YOU GOT TO MEET
THE FIRST LADY. >> THAT WAS CRAZY. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE, BUT ONE OF
THE MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS THAT I WILL TAKE TO MY GRAVE WITH ME. >> Reporter: WHAT DO YOU WANT
AMERICANS TO KNOW ABOUT THE WOMEN'S WATER POLO TEAM? >> I WANT THEM TO KNOW HOW HARD THESE GIRLS WORK.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ALSO, NOT JUST THE WOMEN'S POLO TEAM BUT
THE MEN'S POLO TEAM TOO. WATER POLO IN GENERAL, I WANT THIS SPORT TO BE MORE
RECOGNIZED THAN WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW. >> Reporter: HOW IS THE TEAM IN PARIS?

WATER POLO TEAM, WHICH SONG? >> THE GAME THEY PLAYS HARDER THAN YOU THINK.
