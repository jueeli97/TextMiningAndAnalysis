BACK. >>> THE WOMEN SOCCER TEAM OFF TO A STRONG START WITH HELP FROM DEFENDER NAOMI GIRMA. HOW HER IMMIGRANT PARENTS PUSHED HER TO ATTEND -- ACHIEVE HER DREAMS.
TOP STORY STARTS NOW.
Team USA adds to Olympic medal count
>>> GOOD EVENING, WE ARE ALIVE TONIGHT ONCE AGAIN FROM PARIS AS TEAM USA DAZZLES IN THE CITY OF LIGHT. THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE JUST BEHIND
ME HERE, BUT IT IS USA SWIMMER
KATIE LEDECKY RAINING TRIUMPHANT TONIGHT AFTER STUNNING PERFORMANCE IN THE POOL. IT WAS HER RACE TO BEGIN WITH. THE 1500 METER FREESTYLE IS HER STRONGEST EVENT. SHE OWNS THE 20 FASTEST TIMES
IN THE EVENT HISTORY. IT WAS NO SURPRISE THAT SHE TOOK GOLD WITH EASE LAPPING THE COMPETITION WITH A NOTABLE PACE FAR AHEAD OF THE REST. NOW TIED FOR THE MOST GOLD
MEDALS OF ANY WOMAN IN OLYMPIC HISTORY AND I GOT TO CATCH UP WITH HER MOMENTS AFTER THE OLYMPIC WIN. YOU STARTED SWIMMING WHEN YOU
WERE A LITTLE GIRL. WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THAT LITTLE GIRL WHO SPENT ALL THOSE HOURS IN THE POOL? IF YOU COULD TALK
TO HER NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU TELL HER? >> JUST KEEP IT UP, KEEP HAVING FUN. I'VE ALWAYS HAD FUN IN THIS SPORT. >> AMERICAN TORRI HUSKE ALSO
BRINGING HOME SILVER. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MALE SWIMMERS DID NOT MAKE IT TO THE PODIUM. JACK ALEXEY FAILED TO PLACE AND
RYAN MURPHY SHOCKED THE CROWD WHEN HE DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR THE FINALS. THE U.S. MEN'S GYMNASTICS STRUCK OUT AT THE INDIVIDUAL ALL-AROUND CLAIMING NO MEDALS, THOUGH THE TEAM CLAIMED THE
BRONZE ON MONDAY ENDING A 16 YEAR TEAM MEDAL DROUGHT. LET'S PULL UP THE MEDAL BOARD.
THE U.S. STILL LEADING WITH
FRANCE AND CHINA RIGHT BEHIND AND TODAY'S GAME WASN'T FOR A MEDAL BUT MEN'S BASKETBALL OFF TO A STRONG START AFTER ATTENDS MATCH. THE USA HAD A MUCH BETTER GAME
AGAINST SOUTH SUDAN WINNING BY
-- POINTS. ALL PUTTING UP DOUBLE DIGITS ON THE SCOREBOARD. THERE ARE A LOT OF NEW FACES ON THE U.S. WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM
BUT THEY ARE ALREADY PROVING
UNSTOPPABLE. THE TEAM DEFEATED AUSTRALIA TODAY OFFICIALLY QUALIFYING FOR THE QUARTERFINALS AND ATHLETES OFFICIALLY SWAM IN THE SEINE,
OFFICIALS GIVING THE GREEN LIGHT AFTER CONCERNS ABOUT WATER QUALITY BUT MEN AND WOMEN
SAY THE RIVER LEFT A BAD TASTE
IN THEIR MOUTHS, LITERALLY. ATHLETES SAY THEY GULPED DOWN MOUTHFULS OF WATER DUE TO STRONG CURRENT. HERE'S MORE ON THIS HISTORIC DAY FILLED WITH VICTORY AND DISAPPOINTMENT.
>> 25 METERS LEFT FOR LEDECKY TO MAKE HISTORY. >> Reporter: TONIGHT KATIE LEDECKY SITTING ON TOP OF THE
OLYMPIC WORLD. >> THE GREATEST SWIMMING MACHINE WE'VE EVER SEEN.
>> Reporter: NOW TIED FOR THE MOST MEDALS HELD BY ANY FEMALE OLYMPIAN WITH 12 LOWING PAST
THE COMPETITION IN THE FREESTYLE
, A RACE SHE HAS DOMINATED FOR YEARS TO BRING HOME THE GOLD AND SET A NEW OLYMPIC RECORD. LOOK AND LISTEN TO THIS ARENA GOING WILD FOR ONE OF THE
GREATEST EVER, KATIE LEDECKY. SHE CAME TO PARIS CHASING HISTORY, TONIGHT NO ONE CAN CATCH HER. TAKE ME BACK TO THE POOL.
YOU HIT THE WALL, SEE YOU CELEBRATING, COME OUT, YOU JUMP UP IN THE AIR. TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT MOMENT.
WHY WAS THIS SO SPECIAL? >> I JUST WANTED TO SWIM A TIME
THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY WITH AND I WAS. YOU KNOW, IT'S NEVER EASY TO WIN A GOLD MEDAL SO I DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND I'M TRYING TO TAKE IT DAY BY DAY.
>> Reporter: SHE'S NOT DONE YET. SHE WILL HAVE TWO MORE CHANCES. WHAT MORE CAN WE EXPECT FROM
YOU AT THE NEXT OLYMPIC GAMES?
>> I'M GOING TO REPRESENT TEAM USA TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AND HOPEFULLY BRING HOME MORE
HARDWARE. >> Reporter: A SURPRISE SILVER
FOR TORRI HUSKE IN THE 100 METER FREE. HER THIRD MEDAL OF THE GAME SO FAR. >> I TRUSTED IN MY RACE PLAN AND MY COACH AND WHAT HE WAS
TELLING ME. IT'S SO EXCITING TO BE ON THE PODIUM AGAIN AND I THINK THE COMPETITION BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN ME. >> I SAW YOU HUG YOUR PARENTS.
I KNOW SWIMMING IS A FAMILY SPORT. WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE TO SHARE THESE MEDALS WITH YOUR FAMILY?
>> IT'S SO NICE TO GET TO SHARE THESE MOMENTS WITH THEM. IT MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE
SPECIAL. >> Reporter: LeBRON JAMES AND KEVIN DURAND LEADING AN ALL- STAR MEN'S BASKETBALL SQUAD TO A VICTORY OVER SUDAN.
NOW HEADING TO THE KNOCKOUT ROUND AS THE TEAM GOES FOR ITS FIFTH STRAIGHT GOLD MEDAL. >>> TOUGH DAY FOR THE MEN'S
GYMNASTICS GAME. BOTH FRED RICHARD AND PAUL JUDA
FELL SHORT IN THE INDIVIDUAL ALL-AROUND. AND A DISAPPOINTING OLYMPICS CONTINUES FOR TENNIS STAR COCO
GAUFF WHO WAS KNOCKED OUT OF THE TOURNAMENT AFTER LOSING IN THE THIRD ROUND OF SINGLES COMPETITION. AND ON THE MEN'S SIDE, RAFAEL NADAL'S OLYMPICS AND POSSIBLY
HIS CAREER COMING TO AN END AS NADALCARAZ FELT -- FELL TO THE
AMERICANS. IN WOMEN'S BMX FREESTYLE, A HEARTBROKEN HANNAH, WHO CRASHED
BUT -- PARIS COMING OUT OF THE GATE WITH A STRONG PERFORMANCE TO SECURE SILVER.
IN THE TRIATHLON, POLLUTION NEARLY LED TO THE SWIMMING PORTION BEING CALLED OFF BUT TODAY ORGANIZERS FELT IT WAS SAFE ENOUGH TO JUMP IN. ATHLETES SAY THE TOUGHEST PART
WAS THE CURRENT. AMERICAN BEACH VOLLEYBALL DUO KELLY CHANG AND SARAH HUGHES WINNING A HARD-FOUGHT MATCH AGAINST FRANCE AS THEY STRIVE
Olympic champion Allison Schmitt
FOR GOLD. CHEERED ON BY THEIR BIGGEST FAN, NONE OTHER THAN RAPPERS SNOOP DOGG. FOR MORE ON KATIE LEDECKY'S BIG
DAY IN THE POOL, ELLISON SCHMIDT JOINS ME NOW. A MEDAL IS TO HAS RACED ALONGSIDE KATIE LEDECKY WINNING GOLD AND SILVER IN
RELAYS TOGETHER. SO, YOU KNOW KATIE LEDECKY.
YOU ARE AN OLYMPIAN YOURSELF. WHAT MAKES HER SO SPECIAL?
>> ALL AROUND. HER WORK ETHIC IS TOP-NOTCH. YOU SEE IT EVERY TIME SHE DIVES IN THE WATER.
BEING IN HER RELAYS, I KNOW IF SHE IS AT THE END WE'VE GOT THE BEST CHANCE OF GOLD. IT'S AWESOME TO SEE HER DIVE IN
ESPECIALLY TODAY IN THE 1500. AS SOON AS SHE DOVE IN THE WATER, THE RACE WAS WON, RIGHT THERE. >> YOU TALK ABOUT BEING
SURROUNDED BY THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND THEY ARE YOUR FRIENDS. WHEN YOU GET TO THE OLYMPICS IS
EVERYONE COOL? ARE PEOPLE NERVOUS? WHAT IS THE VIBE LIKE? >> IT'S JUST ANOTHER POOL AT THE BIGGEST STAGE YOU CAN BE AT WHAT WE'VE PRACTICED FOR IT AND
DONE IT DAY IN AND DAY OUT. A POOL IS A POOL. THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
WE TRAINED OUR WHOLE LIVES FOR THAT SO WE GET SO EXCITED WHEN WE GET TO STAND UP BEHIND THE BLOCKS AND DIVE IN THAT POOL FOR THE OLYMPICS.
>> HOW IS TEAM USA DOING IN MEN'S SWIMMING AND WOMEN SWIMMING IN THE GAMES?
>> IT'S CRAZY. TEAM USA, I'M SO BIASED.
GO USA. ALWAYS CHEERING SO LOUD FOR THEM BUT IT'S AMAZING TO SEE HOW MUCH THE SPORT OF SWIMMING
HAS GROWN AND THERE'S OTHER COUNTRIES COMING UP AND ON THAT MEDAL PODIUM . TO BE ABLE TO
SEE THAT, IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ON THE GROWTH OF THE SPORT AND I HOPE THE USA KEEPS FINISHING STRONG. >> I HOPE SO TOO.
DO YOU THINK LEDECKY BREAKS ALL THE RECORDS AND BECOMES THE MOST DECORATED FEMALE ATHLETE EVER IN THE OLYMPICS FOR TEAM USA AND THE MOST GOLD MEDALS?
>> OF COURSE. SHE'S ALREADY ALMOST THERE. TO SEE HER A FEW MORE TIMES IN THIS OLYMPICS, THERE GOES THOSE RECORDS OUT THE DOOR.
>> I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO HER AFTER SHE WON THE GOLD MEDAL TODAY. I ASKED HER ABOUT HER TRAINING AND THE PEOPLE PUSHING HER. HERE'S WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY.
>> TALK TO ME ABOUT YOUR TEAM AND YOUR COACH. DID THEY GET YOU READY FOR THESE GAMES?
>> ABSOLUTELY. JUST THE SETS THAT WE DID AND EVERYTHING WE DID TO PREPARE FOR THE MOMENT, I RELIED ON MY TRAINING AND THAT CONFIDENCE.
>> SO KATIE LEDECKY HAS DECIDED TO TRAIN WITH MAIL SWIMMERS. HOW DOES THAT MAKE HER A BETTER
SWIMMER AND ARE YOU CONSTANTLY TRYING TO BEAT YOURSELF EVERY DAY AND ESSENTIALLY BE BETTER THAN YOU WERE YESTERDAY? >> YES, YOU SHOW UP AND YOU
HAVE TO GIVE 100%. EVEN IF A EURO -- YOU ARE AT
30%, YOU HIT 100%. BUT TRAINING WITH GUYS HAS HELPED ME. I'M FROM A MOSTLY MALE PROGRAM AS WELL.
MICHAEL PHELPS HAS BEEN MY -- SINCE 2005. TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE BEST
MALES IN THE WORLD AND BE ABLE TO TRAIN ALONGSIDE THEM REALLY HELPS US OUT AS FEMALES AS
WELL. >> WHAT YOU THINK SEPARATES THE
ATHLETE THAT MAY BE IS THE BEST IN COLLEGE AND THE ATHLETE THAT GETS TO PARIS? WHAT YOU THINK IS THE ONE THING THAT SEPARATES THOSE TWO
ATHLETES? >> A HOLISTIC APPROACH. IT'S NOT JUST PHYSICAL OR MENTAL, YOU HAVE TO COMBINE ALL OF THEM TOGETHER AND WORK ON IT INSIDE THE POOL AND OUTSIDE THE
POOL TO MAKE IT WORK IN THE POOL. >> THANKS FOR JOINING TOP STORY
TONIGHT. FOR MORE ON TODAY'S EVENTS WE ARE JOINED BY BROADCASTING LEGEND JIMMY ROBERTS IMPAIRS THIS YEAR COVERING HIS 20th
OLYMPIC GAMES. HE WORKED HIS FIRST GAMES BACK IN 1980 WHEN TEAM USA DEFEATED THE SOVIET UNION ON THAT
IMMORTAL RINK IN LAKE PLACID, THE MIRACLE ON ICE. MORE THAN TWO DECADES LATER HE WOULD INTERVIEW TWO MEMBERS OF THAT TEAM FOR NBC. MIKE AND JIM AFTER THEY HELPED
LIGHT THE OLYMPIC FLAME AT THE
2002 WINTER GAMES IN SALT LAKE CITY. HIS NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH COVERAGE OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES OVER THE YEARS AND WE ARE HONORED TO WELCOME JIMMY TO TOP
STORY TONIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. >> TOM I LOOK AT THOSE PICTURES AND IT SEEMS LIKE JUST
YESTERDAY BUT INTERVIEWING THOSE GUYS AT THE SALT LAKE GAMES, THAT WAS ONE OF THE HIGH POINTS OF MY CAREER. IT WAS STUNNING. >> SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR CAREER, YOU LOOK BEHIND YOU AND YOU SEE THIS BEAUTIFUL VIEW, WHAT HAVE THE PARIS GAMES BEEN LIKE SO FAR?
>> I THINK THEY'VE BEEN REMARKABLE.
THERE'S A CONSISTENCY TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES. THERE ARE ALWAYS SURPRISES, THINGS THAT COME OUT OF LEFT FIELD, WHICH ARE SO WONDERFUL
AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE
KATIE LEDECKY WHO YOU JUST ROOT FOR. I THINK SHE'S KIND OF LIKE HALEY'S COMET.
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE WE DON'T HAVE AN APPROPRIATE APPRECIATION FOR WHAT WE ARE WATCHING, SHE HASN'T LOST IN
THE 1500 METERS SINCE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. >> SHE IS STILL HUNGRY. SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE COMPETITOR. >> AND SHE'S REMARKABLE AND
MODEST AND ACCOMPLISHED. THERE WAS A GREAT SHOT ON THE BROADCAST TONIGHT OF A LITTLE
GIRL. SHE HAD TO OF BEEN EIGHT OR 10 YEARS OLD AND AS KATIE WAS WALKING OUT, SHE CAUGHT HER EYE AND WAVED TO HER AND THE
REACTION OF THIS LITTLE GIRL
REALLY IS, FOR ME, WHAT THE OLYMPICS ARE ALL ABOUT. THEY REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT ON PEOPLE AND FOR ALL THAT'S WRONG
WITH IT, THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT IS RIGHT WITH IT AND I JUST THINK THAT ONCE EVERY TWO
YEARS WE GET TO COME TO A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME AND THAT IS RARE.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OTHER SPORTS. TEAM USA MEN'S BASKETBALL. THE DREAM TEAM IN 1992. THESE ARE BEING CALLED THE AVENGERS, WILL THEY WIN THE
GOLD? WHAT YOU THINK? >> IF THEY DON'T, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST UPSETS IN
OLYMPIC HISTORY. I KNOW THAT THEY WON TONIGHT AGAINST SOUTH SUDAN RELATIVELY EASY AND IT WASN'T QUITE AS EASY AS PEOPLE WOULD'VE LIKED BUT, REMEMBER, THEY ONLY BEAT THEM BY ONE POINT WARM-UP GAME
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SO, THE WORLD IS CATCHING UP AND IT'S A LOT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN BARCELONA WITH THE DREAM TEAM. LOOK AT THE FIRST COUPLE OF
ROUNDS OF THE NBA DRAFT AND YOU SEE 20 OF NAMES THAT ARE NOT FROM THE UNITED STATES. YOU SEE THE NBA'S MOST VALUABLE
PLAYER. YOU SEE THE FIRST DRAFT PICK FROM THE NBA DRAFT MOST RECENTLY, A FRENCHMAN.
>> INCREDIBLE TEAM THIS YEAR. I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOME UPSETS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME BIG NAMES. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE NBA AND TENNIS, COCO GAUFF,
NATAL, ALCARAZ ALL LOSING TODAY. WHAT YOU THINK IS HAPPENING THERE IN TENNIS? >> LET'S TALK ABOUT NADAL.
WE TALKED ABOUT, LEDECKY
HASN'T LOST IN YEARS. 14 IS AN IMPORTANT NUMBER ALSO FOR RAFAEL NADAL. HE HAS WON 14 FRENCH OPENS.
TALK ABOUT A MOMENT. WE COULD HAVE SEEN HIS LAST PIECE OF COMPETITION. PERHAPS
IS A 38-YEAR-OLD HE'S RANKED 161st IN THE WORLD. ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO SEE HIM AGAIN? I DON'T THINK IT'S AN UPSET THAT HE LOST IN SINGLES AND HE
GOT ABSOLUTELY THRASHED BY NOVAK DJOKOVIC. THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED BUT TO HAVE LOST WITH CARLOS ALCARAZ,
IT WAS SOMEWHAT OF AN UPSET. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT WITHOUT THE DEMANDS OF SINGLES TENNIS AND PLAYING WITH ALCARAZ, IT'S THE BEST IN THE
WORLD RIGHT NOW. >> BUT THEY ESSENTIALLY WERE ROOKIES AS A TEAM AND THAT CATCHES UP TO YOU AND DOUBLES BUT WITH THE END OF NADAL YOU HAVE THE BEGINNING OF ALCARAZ
WHO MANY THINK COULD BE ONE OF THE GREATS EVER. COCO GAUFF, WHAT'S HAPPENED THERE? >> IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO COCO
GAUFF. IN TENNIS, THE BEST PLAYERS -- BUT IT HAPPENS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS
IN THE OLYMPICS.
I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST UPSETS IN THE HISTORY OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES, IT HAPPENED IN SYDNEY, THERE WAS A RUSSIAN WRESTLER, SYLVIAN RESSLER. GARDNER WON BUT DASHIELL HADN'T
LOST AND I HAVEN'T DONE MY RESEARCH NOW BUT IN FOREVER AND GARDNER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE --
AND HE WASN'T. IT HAPPENS AT THE OLYMPICS. >> WHAT ELSE ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO IN THESE OLYMPIC GAMES? >> I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO EVERYTHING. I THOUGHT THERE WAS A GREAT
MOMENT TODAY, TO BE NOT SOMETHING THAT CAUGHT EVERYBODY'S EYE BUT THE FRENCH HAVE SPENT $1.5 BILLION TO CLEAN UP THE SEINE AND TODAY A FRENCH WOMAN WON THE TRIATHLON
IN THE SEINE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS A PRETTY COOL MOMENT. >> AND A LOT OF THOSE ATHLETES
SWALLOWED THE RIVER WATER BECAUSE THE CURRENT WAS SO STRONG. >> YEAH AND IN TERMS OF WHO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO
SEEING AND STILL HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH OF AN ANTICIPATION,
SIMONE BILES, SHE'S 27 YEARS OLD. THE OLDEST WOMAN TO WIN A GOLD MEDAL IN GYMNASTICS IN 60 YEARS AND SHE IS NOT DONE YET. I THINK AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK
AT THE GOATS, KATIE LEDECKY, SIMONE BILES, IT'S -- >> IS AN INCREDIBLE ERA FOR
Trump attacks Kamala Harris' race
TEAM USA. JIMMY ROBERTS, MY FRIEND, MY NEIGHBOR, WE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT. I OWE YOU DINNER WHEN WE GET
BACK. JIMMY ROBERTS, EVERYONE.
>>> WE WILL GET BACK TO OLYMPIC COVERAGE A LITTLE LATER. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'S APPEARANCE THIS AFTERNOON.
TRUMP'S UNDER FIRE FOR CLAIMING HIS NEWLY MINTED 2024
RIVAL KAMALA HARRIS RECENTLY BECAME BLACK AND DEFENDED HIS REMARKS ABOUT WHAT HE CALLED BLACK JOBS. TAKE HAS MORE ON THE POLITICAL
FALLOUT. >> Reporter: FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FACING FIERCE BACKLASH
TONIGHT AFTER FALSELY CLAIMING
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WHO WENT TO A HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND IS A MEMBER OF A BLACK SORORITY DID NOT IDENTIFY AS BLACK . >> I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS BLACK
UNTIL A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN SHE HAPPENED TO TURN BLACK AND NOW SHE WANTS TO BE KNOWN AS BLACK. SO I DON'T KNOW IS SHE INDIAN
OR IS SHE BLACK? I RESPECT EITHER ONE BUT SHE WAS INDIAN ALL THE WAY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE MADE A TURN AND SHE BECAME A BLACK PERSON.
>> Reporter: THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONDING IN REAL TIME . >> WHAT YOU JUST READ OUT TO ME IS REPULSIVE. IT'S INSULTING. MIKE HARRIS IS THE DAUGHTER OF
INDIAN AND JAMAICAN IMMIGRANTS. HER CAMPAIGN TONIGHT SAYING,
QUOTE, TODAY'S TIRADE IS SIMPLY A TASTE OF THE CHAOS AND DIVISION THAT HAS BEEN A HALLMARK OF TRUMP'S MAGA RALLIES THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN. AND CALLED ON HIM TO DEBATE.
IT UNFOLDED DURING A COMBATIVE INTERVIEW AT A BLACK JOURNALISM CONFERENCE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT THERE TO
COURT BLACK VOTERS. >> I'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR THE BLACK POPULATION OF THIS COUNTRY INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT, INCLUDING OPPORTUNITY ZONES.
>> Reporter: LATER WAS PRESSED ABOUT HIS COMMENTS THAT THE RECORD NUMBER OF MIGRANTS HAVE HIT THE BLACK POPULATION HARD, TAKING WHAT HE TERMED BLACK
JOBS. >> COMING FROM THE BORDER ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAPPEN TO BE TAKING BLACK JOBS. YOU HAVE THE BEST -- >> WHAT EXACTLY IS A BLACK JOB,
SIR? >> ANYBODY THAT HAS A JOB. >> ALL RIGHT, MR. PRESIDENT --
>> THEY ARE KEEPING THE EMPLOYMENT AWAY FROM BLACK PEOPLE.
>> Reporter: THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN GOING AFTER HARRIS ON
IMMIGRATION. BUT HARRIS FLIPPING THE SCRIPT OVERNIGHT, POINTING TO TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO SCUTTLE A BIPARTISAN BORDER BILL HE SAID WASN'T
TOUGH ENOUGH. >> HE TANKED THE BIPARTISAN DEAL BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP HIM WIN AN ELECTION.
WHICH GOES TO SHOW, DONALD
TRUMP'S DOES NOT CARE ABOUT BORDER SECURITY. HE ONLY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF. >> Reporter: TRUMP'S DEFIANT
Hamas political leader killed in Iran
TONIGHT BLASTING THE QUESTIONS AT THAT EVENT AS RUDE AND NASTY. A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN TELLS NBC NEWS THEY SAW THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE AS COMPLETELY UNHINGED
AND PAINFUL. TOM? >> GARRETT HAAKE FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TONIGHT. WE TURN NOW TO THE OTHER MAJOR
HEADLINE. BREAKING NEWS OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST. IRANIAN STATE MEDIA REPORTED THAT A HAMAS POLITICAL LEADER HAS BEEN ASSASSINATED IN NORTHERN TEHRAN. THEY SAY HE WAS VISITING FOR
THE INAUGURATION OF THE COUNTRY'S NEW PRESIDENT WHEN HE WAS KILLED BY AN AIRBORNE GUIDED OBJECT AISLE. ISRAEL HAS NOT YET CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK BUT THE ASSASSINATION OF
THREATENING TO DERAIL HOPE FOR CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA. RAF SANCHEZ HAS THE LATEST.
>> Reporter: TONIGHT CRIES FOR REVENGE AGAINST ISRAEL ECHOING ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER THE BRAZEN ASSASSINATION OF HAMAS'S POLITICAL CHIEF IN THE HEART OF THE IRANIAN CAPITAL.
ISMAIL HANIYEH KILLED IN AN ISRAELI MISSILE STRIKE JUST HOURS AFTER MEETING IS -- IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER.
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TONIGHT REFUSING TO SAVE HIS COUNTRY IS RESPONSIBLE BUT WARNING ISRAEL WILL EXACT A HEAVY PRICE FOR ANY AGGRESSION
AGAINST US. >> Reporter: FEARS GROWING THAT THE DEATH COULD DERAIL FRAGILE CEASE-FIRE TALKS AND SPARK A
WIDER WAR. >> I THINK IT'S TOO SOON TO KNOW WHAT ANY OF THESE REPORTED EVENTS COULD MEAN FOR THE CEASE-
FIRE DEAL. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE ARE GOING TO STOP WORKING ON IT. >> Reporter: HELD HOSTAGE IN
GAZA FOR 299 DAYS. WE MET HIS GRANDSON, DANIEL.
DO YOU THINK BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING A DEAL TO BRING THE HOSTAGES HOME?
>> IF HE'S NOT SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING THE HOSTAGES HOME, THE AMERICANS NEED TO MAKE ALL THE NECESSARY PRESSURE THAT HE WILL DO SO. >> Reporter: 1000 MILES AWAY
FROM TEHRAN IN BEIRUT, THE CAPITAL OF LEBANON, HEZBOLLAH
CONFIRMING ONE OF ITS TOP COMMANDERS WAS KILLED DURING AN
ISRAELI STRIKE. ISRAEL SAYS HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF 12 CHILDREN IN A ROCKET ATTACK BUT LEBANON
SAYS THIS BROTHER AND SISTER WERE ALSO KILLED IN THE ISRAELI BOMBING, A CYCLE OF REVENGE THAT'S TAKING THE REGION TO THE BRINK OF WAR.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT ISSUING A STARK NEW WARNING TO U.S. CITIZENS, GET OUT OF SOUTH LEBANON BECAUSE NEW FIGHTING MAY BE ABLE TO ERUPT.
TOM? >> RAF SANCHEZ, THANK YOU. FOR MORE ON ESCALATING TENSIONS IN THE U.S. WE TURN IT OVER TO
RICHARD ENGEL WHO JOINS US HERE IN PARIS. YOU'VE COVERED THIS AREA FOR MORE THAN A DECADE NOW. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. IS THIS A TURNING POINT IN THIS
WAR? >> I DON'T THINK WE KNOW YET AND I WOULD WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW WHEN THE LEADER OF HEZBOLLAH SPEAKS.
USUALLY WHEN HE SPEAKS HE DELIVERS THE OFFICIAL HEZBOLLAH
RESPONSE AND FOLLOWING HIS SPEECHES THERE ARE OFTEN MILITARY ACTIONS. MILITARY ASSAULTS, ROCKET ASSAULTS AGAINST ISRAEL,
AGAINST ISRAELI MILITARY BASES. WHAT WE SAW OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS WERE TWO TARGETED
STRIKES BY ISRAEL ALTHOUGH ISRAEL HASN'T ACKNOWLEDGED THE ATTACK ON THE HAMAS LEADER,
ISMAIL HANIYEH ALTHOUGH I THINK THERE'S LITTLE DOUBT THAT ISRAEL WAS RESPONSIBLE. EACH TARGETED WAS VERY
DIFFERENT. THE ONE ON THE HEZBOLLAH LEADER WAS AGAINST A SECRETIVE MILITARY LEADER WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN HIDING FOR DECADES.
HE WAS WANTED BY THE UNITED STATES GOING BACK TO THE 1983 ATTACK IN BEIRUT THAT KILLED HUNDREDS OF AMERICAN MARINES, HE WAS THE SECOND IN COMMAND, THE TOP MILITARY LEADER OF
HEZBOLLAH. HIS PICTURE WASN'T KNOWN, ONLY RELEASED AFTER HE WAS KILLED. THAT WAS AN INTELLIGENCE BASE
ATTACK ON A MILITARY LEADER IN BEIRUT. WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAN WAS A
TOTALLY DIFFERENT CATEGORY. THE HAMAS LEADER WAS A POLITICAL LEADER, HE WAS WELL- KNOWN, HE OPERATED OPENLY IN PUBLIC. I'VE MET HIM. MANY JOURNALISTS HAVE MET HIM.
HE WAS NOT HARD TO FIND. HE WAS OPERATING IN QATAR AND BEFORE THAT, ISTANBUL AND TO
TARGET HIM IN IRAN, IN TEHRAN, RIGHT AFTER HE HAD MET THE COUNTRY'S SUPREME LEADER,
DURING INAUGURAL EVENTS IS CLEARLY A MESSAGE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT IRAN WILL
TAKE AND SEEMS TO BE TAKING AS A PROVOCATION, AN OFFENSE TO ATTACK A GUEST OF THE STATE
JUST AFTER HE HAD MET THE SUPREME LEADER. VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF ATTACKS.
>> RICHARD, REAL QUICK, I'VE HEARD FORMER DIPLOMATS SAY THERE'S NO WAY THESE ATTACKS COULD HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OR THE HELP OF THE UNITED STATES. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?
>> I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE FOR HEZBOLLAH, NOT THE
CASE FOR ISMAIL HANIYEH. HE WAS PART OF THE NEGOTIATING TEAM. THE U.S. IS PUSHING
NEGOTIATIONS WITH HAMAS AND NOW YOU SEE ONE SIDE OF NEGOTIATIONS KILLING A MEMBER OF THE OTHER NEGOTIATING DELEGATION. I DON'T THINK THAT IS SOMETHING
THAT THE U.S. WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED IF IT HAD KNOWN ABOUT
OPENLY EVEN IF IT HAS ISSUES WITH HAMAS WHICH -- CLEARLY DOES CONSIDERING A TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION. >> RICHARD ENGEL, THANK YOU FOR
THAT. >>> STILL AHEAD, THE BREAKING
ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE MEN TIED TO THE TERROR ATTACK. WHAT WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THAT AGREEMENT. >>> CATASTROPHIC FLOODING IN
STATES. THE HOMES SWEPT OFF THEIR FOUNDATIONS AND ROADS
COMPLETELY WASHED OUT. >>> A HISTORIC DAY IN THE POOL. WE WILL TALK TO TWO SWIMMING FANS.
Swimming super fans join Top Story
>> THE CROWD IS ROARING AS
MERCHAND TRIES. HE'S DOING IT. LEON MARCHAND TO THE WALL.
ANOTHER GOLD! >> WE ARE BACK WITH SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE PARIS OLYMPICS AND THAT WAS THE INCREDIBLE MOMENT FRENCH SWIMMER LEON MERCHAN CAME FROM BEHIND IN THE
BUTTERFLY TO WIN GOLD IN HIS HOME COUNTRY.
MERCHAND WON TWO GOLD MEDALS TODAY AND THREE OVERALL SO FAR. FOR THE FRENCH HE IS THE FACE OF THE PARIS OLYMPICS AND WE
HAVE TWO SWIMMING ENTHUSIASTS JOINING US TONIGHT ON TOP STORIES TOP FANS. HUSBAND AND WIFE DAVE AND COURTNEY THOMPSON, OLYMPIC SUPER FANS AND FOR THEM OR
SWIMMERS WHO MET ON THEIR SWIM TEAM IN COLLEGE IN MASSACHUSETTS AND THEY ARE HERE IN PARIS TO SEE ALL THE SWIMMING EVENTS BUT ALSO CHECKING OUT A FEW OTHER SPORTS
AS WELL. THANKS FOR JOINING TOP STORY. WHAT HAS IT BEEN LIKE TO WATCH SWIMMING? I WAS THERE TONIGHT, IT IS
WILD. >> IT'S AMAZING. I'VE NEVER BEEN IN A POOL QUITE LIKE THAT. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE BEING A
SWIMMER AT THAT LEVEL. IT WAS REALLY FUN. >> AND HAVING LEON MERCHAN DO
WHAT HE'S DOING AND SEEING THE WAY THE CROWD IS REACTING TO HIM, THE INCREDIBLE ENERGY THEY
HAVE. >> I'VE BEEN THERE, I'VE WITNESSED IT. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE IT BECAUSE IT GETS SO LOUD AND
I'VE HEARD OTHER SWIMMERS SAY THAT WHEN THEY ARE SWIMMING THEY ARE NOTICING IT. >> YEAH, I THINK ONE OF THE GREAT MOMENTS TONIGHT WAS IN
HIS 200 BREASTSTROKE WHEN EVERYONE IS CHANTING IN UNISON EVERY TIME HE COMES UP FOR AIR. THE PLACE IS JUST ROCKING. YOU ALMOST WANT TO ROOT FOR HIM
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ROOTING FOR TEAM USA. TALK ABOUT KATIE LEDECKY. WHAT WAS IT LIKE TO WITNESS
HISTORY? >> IT WAS AWESOME. WE GOT TICKETS FOR THIS SESSION BECAUSE WE WANTED TO SEE HER
SWIM. IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL SEEING HER LIVE. >> YOU GUYS KNOW HOW MUCH IT
TAKES. IT IS SO HARD TO GET TO THE OLYMPICS BUT TO DO WHAT SHE'S DOING, TO BREAK ALL THE RECORDS
AND KEEP IT GOING, SHE WON BY A LOT. SHE'S OUT THERE THAT ENTIRE 15 MINUTES AND NO ONE IS CATCHING UP TO HER. >> THEY SAID ON THE BROADCAST,
SHE HAS THE TOP 20 TIMES EVER
IN THE 1500 AND DISTANCE SWIMMERS DON'T TEND TO HAVE THIS KIND OF LONGEVITY AND TO DO IT SINCE -- I HOPE SHE COMES
BACK FOR 2028. IT'S AMAZING WHAT SHE'S DONE. >> YOU GUYS ARE AMERICANS WHO
HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WITNESS THE OLYMPICS UP CLOSE.
FANS GO TO BASEBALL, BASKETBALL, WE'VE GOT GREAT SPORTS IN AMERICA BUT HOW DO YOU THINK THE OLYMPICS ARE
DIFFERENT? >> JUST THE INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR AND MEETING FANS FROM ALL OVER. WE WENT TO SEE VOLLEYBALL AND DIDN'T EVEN SEE AN AMERICAN
TEAM AND IT WAS SUCH AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE COME ASSOCIATE ATHLETES AT SO MANY LEVELS AND SO MANY ALLEGIANCES, THAT
NATIONAL PRIDE AND EVERYONE'S HOME COLORS IS REALLY FUN.
>> IT'S JUST AN AWESOME OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT ATHLETES WHO WORK INCREDIBLY HARD AND ARE VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO AND GIVE THEM SOME OF WHAT THEY DESERVE.
>> WHAT ELSE ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN THE PARIS GAMES? >> WE WERE AT GYMNASTICS LAST NIGHT. THAT WAS AMAZING WATCHING
SIMONE AND THE TEAM DO WHAT THEY DID AND SEEING HER COME BACK FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE IN TOKYO AND THEN WE'VE GOT
RUNNING ON FRIDAY, TRACK AND FIELD SESSION. FORMER SWIMMERS, NOW WE RUN
MORE, SO. >> YOU GUYS ARE SET, WILL YOU
DO THE SAME THING IN LOS ANGELES? WILL YOU GO TO THOSE GAMES? >> WE MIGHT HAVE TO TRY IT OUT. >> THE EXCITING THING THERE IS THE FOOTBALL STADIUM.
THAT WOULD BE A COOL CROWD TO GO TO. >> THANK YOU FOR JOINING THE
SHOW. WE WILL HAVE MORE. INCLUDING THE PARALYMPIC
>> MORE AMERICANS TURN TO NBC NEWS THAN ANY OTHER NEWS ORGANIZATION. >>> BACK NOW WITH A LOOK BACK.
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE FIRST EVER WOMEN'S 100 METER OLYMPIC FINAL ON THIS DATE IN 1928.
TEAM USA'S ELIZABETH ROBINSON CROSSING THE FINISH LINE BECOMING THE FIRST WOMAN TO WIN A GOLD MEDAL FOR TRACK AND
FIELD. SHE WAS JUST 16 YEARS OLD. A LOT MORE OLYMPIC HISTORY HAS BEEN MADE HERE TODAY AND WE HAVE MORE FROM PARIS AND OUR NEW LOCATION AS WE SHOWCASE OUR
SET HERE IN PARIS. WE WILL HAVE THAT LATER IN THE BROADCAST BUT WE TURNED IT OVER NOW TO OUR FRIEND, JAZMIN VESUVIUS AND IN OUR TOP STORY
WITH OTHER HEADLINES IN THE BLACK SWAN MURDER TRIAL.
>> Reporter: STARTING WITH THE PLEA DEAL JUST ANNOUNCED IN CONNECTION TO THE TERROR ATTACKS ON THE 11th, THE PENTAGON ANNOUNCING THAT THREE
MEN ACCUSED OF PLOTTING THE ATTACKS WILL PLEAD GUILTY TO SOME CHARGES AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK AT GUANTANAMO BAY. THE THREE WERE INITIALLY
CHARGED IN 2008. THE DETAILS OF THE PLEA AGREEMENT HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED. >>> UNREST CONTINUING ACROSS
THE UK IN RESPONSE TO THE FATAL STABBING OF THREE YOUNG GIRLS OUT A DANCE EVENT AREA PROTESTERS IN LONDON CLASHING
WITH POLICE NEAR THE PRIME MINISTERS RESIDENCE AND THE
PARLIAMENT. ONE DAY AFTER A LARGE GROUP ATTACKED POLICE OFFICERS IN A
LOCAL MOSQUE. THE CROWD CHANTING ANTI-ISLAM AND ANTI-IMMIGRANT SLOGANS.
WRITERS FALSELY BELIEVE THE SUSPECT IS MUSLIM OR AN ASYLUM SEEKER. >>> A DEADLY LISTERIA OUTBREAK. BOARS HEAD EXPANDING TO 7
MILLION ADDITIONAL POUNDS OF
DELI AND POULTRY ITEMS.
THE OUTBREAK HAS RESULTED IN AT LEAST TWO DEATHS AND 33 HOSPITALIZATIONS ACROSS 13 STATES. BOARS HEAD INITIATED THE RECALL LAST WEEK AFTER A SAMPLE TESTED POSITIVE FOR THE PRUDE BORN --
FOODBORNE BACTERIAL ILLNESS. AND A MISSOURI MAN FREE AFTER SPENDING 34 YEARS IN A PRISON
FOR CRIME. HE DID NOT COMMIT. VIDEO SHOWING CHRISTOPHER DUNN LEAVING COURT JUST YESTERDAY AFTER A JUDGE OVERTURNED HIS FIRST-DEGREE MURDER CONVICTION. HE WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN
PRISON FOR A DEADLY SHOOTING BACK IN 1990. DESPITE NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE LINKING HIM TO THE CRIME.
THE TWO YOUNG WITNESSES THAT INITIALLY GAVE TESTIMONY SAID THEY WERE COERCED BY POLICE.
Trump attacks Kamala Harris' race
>>> WE WANT TO GO BACK TO A STORY WE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER
TONIGHT AND CONTENTIOUS MOMENTS FROM FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S'S APPEARANCE TODAY AT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS. TRUMP'S COMING UNDER FIRE FOR
SAYING VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS, QUOTE, BECAME BLACK. FOR MORE, I BRING IN WASHINGTON
CORRESPONDENT YAMICHE ALCINDOR. THIS WAS A VERY COMBATIVE
APPEARANCE. TRUMP'S WAS SPARRING WITH ONE OF THE MODERATORS, FROM ABC
NEWS. WHAT WERE SOME OF THE MORE CONTENTIOUS EXCHANGES YOU WITNESSED? >> THIS WAS A REMARKABLE
EXPERIENCE TO HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM WHILE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH AND ARGUING AND REALLY
DISPARAGING, ESPECIALLY RACHEL SCOTT OF ABC NEWS, A DEAR COLLEAGUE OF OURS.
THERE IS A SINCE HE CAME IN HERE WANTING TO SPREAD THINGS THAT JUST WERE NOT TRUE AND WAS ANGRY WHEN SHE AND OTHER JOURNALISTS WERE PUSHING BACK
ON HIM SAYING THINGS THAT JUST SIMPLY WERE LIES. AT ONE POINT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT, AS YOU SAID, VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WAS
ONLY CONSIDERING HERSELF INDIAN AND HAD NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE WAS
BLACK AND THAT BECAME REALLY CONTENTIOUS GOING BACK AND FORTH BECAUSE SHE WENT TO A
HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND JOINED A HISTORICALLY BLACK SORORITY, SHE'S BEEN CLEAR THAT HER FATHER IS BLACK OR WAS BLACK AND HER MOTHER IS INDIAN
AND AT NO POINT IN HER LIFETIME HAS SHE NOT CLAIMED HER AFRICAN-
AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN AMERICAN HERITAGE. THAT IS WHAT HAS REALLY BEEN CONTENTIOUS, BACK AND FORTH. THE OTHER ONE WAS RACHEL SCOTT ASKED HIM ABOUT THE JANUARY 6 ATTACK ON THE CAPITAL AND ASKED
HIM, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO PARDON PEOPLE WHO BEAT UP POLICE OFFICERS, WHO WERE DRAGGING PEOPLE THROUGH THE HALLS OF CONGRESS, WHO BROKE
LAWS AND WERE CONVICTED AND THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAID HE BELIEVES THOSE PEOPLE SHOULD BE
PARDONED AND HE GOT REALLY ANGRY WHEN SHE WAS PUSHING HIM ON THE IDEA THAT WAS WRONG AND PUSHING HIM TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF SO THERE WERE A NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT CONTENTIONS BUT THOSE WERE THE TWO THAT STUCK OUT OVER A 34 MINUTE AREA AND HE CAME OUT REALLY FROM THE BEGINNING SAYING THAT HE WAS
NOT BEING WELCOMED IN THE RIGHT
WAY. >> THE CONVERSATION WAS
SUPPOSED TO LAST AN HOUR BUT ONLY LASTED 34 MINUTES. IT SEEMED AS IF THE TRUMP'S TEAM PULLED THE PLUG EARLY. WHAT WAS THE REACTION TO TRUMP'S'S APPEARANCE IN THE
ROOM? >> Reporter: THIS IS A ROOM
FULL OF BLACK JOURNALISTS, A NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS, WE MEET EVERY YEAR IN A DIFFERENT CITY. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO THE JOB THAT ME AND YOU DO SO THEY WERE
REALLY INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT HE HAD TO SAY BUT WHEN HE STARTED DISPARAGING RACHEL, WHICH AGAIN IS A DEAR COLLEAGUE OF OURS, PEOPLE STARTED TO GET ANGRY AND THEY ALSO GOT ANGRY
WHEN HE WAS SAYING THINGS LIKE
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS ISN'T BLACK, THAT SHE NEVER CLAIMED THAT WHEN WE KNOW AS BLACK PEOPLE HOW OFFENSIVE THAT IS GIVEN THE FACT THAT SHE'S TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HER
PARENTS MET AS CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS, THAT SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL GOING TO CIVIL RIGHTS PROTEST, SHE'S MADE A BIG PART OF HER CAREER TALKING ABOUT RACIAL INJUSTICE AND
HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE IN OTHER WAYS AS A PROSECUTOR SO I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE OFFENDED IN THE ROOM AND I ALSO THINK IT'S NOT LOST
AND WE HAVE TO ALSO UNDERSCORE THAT HE WAS ALSO REALLY INSULTING NABJ AND SAYING IT HAD ALL RUN LATE BECAUSE OF THE
ASSOCIATION NOT HAVING OUR STUFF TOGETHER WHEN THAT WASN'T TRUE. THE SOUND WAS FINE, THERE WAS NO TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT I
COULD SEE SITTING THERE, I WAS ONLY ONE ROW AWAY, 20 FEET AWAY FROM HIM BUT HE KEPT COMPLAINING ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE NOT TRUE SO THERE WERE
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM THAT WERE REALLY OFFENDED BECAUSE THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES AND IT'S AN ILLUSTRIOUS ORGANIZATION WHERE PEOPLE FELT LIKE THEY HAD TO
BAND TOGETHER TO HAVE NEWSROOMS THAT COVERED LACK PEOPLE FAIRLY AND TO HAVE THAT BE INSULTED BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS VERY BOTHERSOME AND VERY OFFENSIVE TO SOME PEOPLE IN THE ROOM
INCLUDING'S SOME PEOPLE WHO FOUNDED THE ORGANIZATION.
>> HOW IS THE HARRIS CAMP RESPONDING TONIGHT AND HOW MIGHT THEY CAPITALIZE ON THIS
MOMENT? >> Reporter: THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS DEFINITELY
CAPITALIZING. WITHIN A FEW MINUTES, THEIR RAPID RESPONSE WAS ALREADY TWEETING DIFFERENT RESPONSES TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT TALKING
ABOUT HER RACIAL HERITAGE AND THEY ALSO PUT OUT A STATEMENT THAT I WANT TO READ PART OF IT BECAUSE AS I WAS GETTING READY FOR THIS I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
DEFTLY PUT THIS INTO THEIR WORDS, THEY SAID THE HOSTILITY DONALD TRUMP'S SHOWED ON STAGE TODAY IS THE SAME HOSTILITY HE HAS SHOWN THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. THEY ALSO SAY TODAY'S TIRADE
IS A SIGN OF THE CHAOS AND DIVISION THAT HAS BEEN A HALLMARK OF TRUMP'S MAGA RALLIES HIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN AND
A HALLMARK OF WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SEE FROM ACROSS THE DEBATE STAGE SO THEY ARE USING
THIS MOMENT TO PUSH HIM TO HAVE A DEBATE AND THEY SAY ALL DONALD TRUMP'S HAS TO DO IS STOP PLAYING GAMES AND SHOW UP TO THE DEBATE ON SEPTEMBER 10th
AND THERE'S THIS SORT OF MANTRA
THAT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS HAS
STARTED TO SAY WHICH IS SAY IT TO MY FACE, THIS IDEA THAT SHE REALLY WANTS DONALD TRUMP'S TO SAY ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS HE'S BEEN SAYING ABOUT HER,
WHETHER THAT SHE WAS A BAD PROSECUTOR, TO SOFT ON CRIME, THAT SHE MESSED UP THE BORDER, THE BORDER CHAOS IS BECAUSE OF HER OR IN THIS CASE THAT SHE'S
Deadly wildfires force evacuations in CO
QUESTIONING HER HERITAGE AND HOW SHE HAS TALKED ABOUT HER IDENTITY. SHE'S BASICALLY SAYING, COME SAY IT TO MY FACE ON SEPTEMBER 10th ON THE DEBATE STAGE. WE WILL SEE IF THAT HAPPENS
BECAUSE THE TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AND DONALD TRUMP'S SO FAR HAS NOT CONFIRMED THAT THEY WANT TO DO THAT DEBATE STILL. >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME.

WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW? >> I DON'T WANT TO LOSE MY HOME OR MY NEIGHBORS.
>> EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD IN THIS FACILITY IS AT RISK. THIS FIRE IS NOT AN EASY FIGHT. THE TERRAIN IS TREACHEROUS.
>> Reporter: THIS IS WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. THIS STEEP TERRAIN. ANOTHER BIG CONCERN OUR RATTLESNAKES. THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM HERE MAKING IT DANGEROUS AND CHALLENGING FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO
DO THEIR JOB AND GET THAT UNDER CONTROL. THIS FIRE AMONG 95 BURNING ACROSS THE WEST INCLUDING OREGON, WASHINGTON, AND
CALIFORNIA. WHERE CREWS ARE GETTING A HANDLE ON THE MASSIVE PARK FIRE AFTER IT CHEWED THROUGH MORE THAN 300 STRUCTURES PERIOD AS
EVACUEES RETURN HOME, SOME FINDING NOTHING LEFT BEHIND.
>> IT'S JUST THE HOPE THAT MAYBE YOU WILL FLIP SOMETHING OVER AND IT WON'T BE ASHES.
>> Reporter: AS THIS FIRE CONTINUES TO BURN HERE, OFFICIALS HAVE NOT YET GIVEN A CAUSE OF THE FIRE BUT WITH RESOURCES STRETCHED THIN ACROSS THE STATE WITH MULTIPLE FIRES
BURNING RIGHT NOW, THE GOVERNOR HAS CALLED IN THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP MANAGE THESE
FIRES. >> THANK YOU FOR THAT. NOW TO THE LATEST IN A MURDER CASE BEING CALLED THE BLACK SWAN TRIAL. A FORMER BALLERINA CHARGED IN
THE FATAL SHOOTING OF HER HUSBAND NOW FOUND GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER IN FLORIDA ONLY

DETAILS. >> THE DEFENDANT IS GUILTY OF

DEATH OF HER HUSBAND. HIS FAMILY SPEAKING OUT. >> NO ONE WINS IN THIS CASE EXCEPT THAT JUSTICE WAS SERVED.
>> HE LOVED HIS WIFE. HE LOVED HIS GIRLS, AND HE WANTED TO BE HERE FOR THEM. >> Reporter: SHE GAINED
NOTORIETY AFTER KILLING HER HUSBAND, DOUG IN 2020.
TESTIFYING IN HER OWN DEFENSE, SHE ALLEGED HE WAS ABUSIVE, EVEN HITTING THEIR DOG SO HARD THE PET WAS KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS. SHE SAID AFTER HER HUSBAND
STRUCK HER IN THE FACE, SHE SHOT HIM IN SELF-DEFENSE.
>> I WAS PULLING THE TRIGGER AND HE JUST KEPT COMING.
>> I APOLOGIZE TO ALL THE WOMEN IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
SITUATIONS. THEY DESERVE JUSTICE AND I'M VERY HAPPY THAT MY DAD GOT THE JUSTICE HE DESERVES.
>> GOD LOVES HER, BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR CRIME. >> Reporter: PROSECUTORS ARGUED
THE EVIDENCE DID NOT MATCH THE
DEFENDANTS STORY, PORTRAYING BENEFIELD AS A MOTHER INTENT ON GETTING SOLE CUSTODY OF THE COUPLE'S YOUNG DAUGHTER.
>> THIS WAS A CUSTODY BATTLE THAT THIS MOTHER WAS GOING TO WIN AT ALL COSTS.
>> Reporter: BENEFIELD WAS CHARGED WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER BUT THE JURY FOUND HER GUILTY OF THE LESSER CRIME. >> DOES THAT INDICATE THAT
MAYBE THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME ELEMENT OF SELF-DEFENSE
HERE? >> IN FLORIDA THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SELF-DEFENSE CLAIM AND INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER OR UNINTENTIONAL MANSLAUGHTER IS OD
