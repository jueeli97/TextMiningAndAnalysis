DOUBT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS
HIT BY A BULLET.
BACK TO YOU.
>>> BREAKING OVERNIGHT, HAMAS
SAYS ITS CHIEF POLITICAL LEADER
HAS BEEN CINCIASSASSINATED IN T.
HE WAS TARGETED AT HIS RESIDENCE
WHILE VISITING TEHRAN.
THEY REPORT THAT THE APARTMENT
WAS HIT BY A QUOTE, AIR LAUNCHED
GUIDED PROJECTILE.
HANIYEH HAD LIVED OUTSIDE GAZA
FOR YEARS AND WAS A CLOSE ALLY
OF IRAN.
HE IS THE HIGHEST-RANKING HAMAS
LEADER TO HAVE BEEN KILLED SINCE
THE WAR WITH ISRAEL BEGAN.
FOR THE LATEST, LET'S WHEBRING
MEGAN FITZGERALD.
DO WE KNOW WHO'S BEHIND THIS?
>> Reporter: AT THIS POINT, IT'S
STILL UNCLEAR WHO'S BEHIND THIS
ATTACK.
HAMAS IS BLAMING ISRAEL, SAYING
ISMAIL HANIYEH WAS KILLED IN THE
RESIDENCE HE WAS STAYING IN BY
THE ISRAELIS AFTER ATTENDING THE
INAUGURATION CEREMONY FOR IRAN'S
PRESIDENT, BUT THE IDF HAS NOT
TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY OR
COMMENTED FOR THAT MATTER.
THIS IS ENORMOUSLY IMPACTFUL OR
THE DEVELOPMENTS IN GAZA, AND
ANY POSSIBILITY OF PEACE
NEGOTIATIONS, SINCE HANIYEH WAS
THE MAIN NEGOTIATOR FROM HAMAS.
WE'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING, OF
COURSE, ABOUT RISING TENSIONS IN
THE REGION.
MOST CERTAINLY AFTER SATURDAY'S
ATTACK IN THE ISRAELI OCCUPIED
GOLAN HEIGHTS.
BUT THE KILLING OF HANIYEH COULD
EASILY EVOLVE INTO A REGIONAL
WAR, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE SECOND
IN COMMAND OF HEZBOLLAH WAS
REPORTEDLY KILLED LAST NIGHT IN
BEIRUT.
