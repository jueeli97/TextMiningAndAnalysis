BUT SOME SPORTS ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY. TALKED WAS ABOUT TEAM USA WOMEN STOCKER. THEY STARTED OFF VERY STRONG
TODAY. >> Reporter: THEY REALLY DAY. THIS IS A PRETTY EASY GAME FOR THEM AGAINST ZAMBIA. THEY WON 3-0. THIS TEAM HAS LOST BIG NAMES. THIS IS A YOUNG
TEAM. THERE IS SOMETHING OF AN UNKNOWN ENTITY. THE GAMES WILL GET A LOT HARDER THAN THE ONE WE SAW TODAY, BUT THEY ARE OFF TO A GREAT START.
>> WE ALSO GOT OUR FIRST LOOK AT TEAM USA WOMEN STOCHASTICS PRACTICING IN PARIS TODAY. HOW ARE THEY LOOKING?. TERRIFIC. NO ONE HAS COME EVEN CLOSE TO
SIMONE SAID SHE CAME BACK AFTER GETTING THE TWISTIES IN TOKYO. THE WHOLE TEAM IS LOOKING GOOD
AS WELL. SIMONE HERE IN PARIS IS A TOTAL CELEBRITY. WE STUMBLED ACROSS A TIKTOK.
THIS WOMAN IS A RUGBY PLAYER FOR NEW ZEALAND. SHE RAN INTO SIMONE AND GOT ONE OF HER COVETED PINS. LISTEN TO WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY.

CELEBRITY. THE WHOLE TEAM LOOK A LOT FAMILIAR TO PEOPLE WHO WATCH TOKYO. FOUR OUT OF THE FIVE GYMNASTS WERE AT TOKYO. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR REDUCTION,
NOT TO SIMONE, BUT THE TEAM. THE GOT SILVER IN TOKYO AND ARE LOOKING TO GET GOLD HERE, OF COURSE. >> CASEY COFFELT MAKER PARIS
DEBUT IN ARCHERY. TELL US ABOUT THE COMPETITION IN THE MAJESTIC VENUE WHERE IT IS TAKING PLACE. >> Reporter: YOU KNOW, THIS IS A TERRIFIC STORY.
PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T FOLLOW ARCHERY A WHOLE LOT.
SHE IS THE WORLD LEADER IN ARCHERY. SHE HAD A GREAT DAY TODAY. SHE FINISHED FOURTH. IF SHE WINS IN THE INDIVIDUAL META, SHE WILL BE THE FIRST
WOMAN TO WIN AN INDIVIDUAL META IN ARCHERY SOCIETY 76. THAT IS A LONG TIME.
PEOPLE SHOULD TURN INTO ARCHERY.
>> KEIR SIMMONS, A BIG DAY TOMORROW. YOU BEEN HERE FOR MONTHS COVERING THIS. THIS IS AN OPENING CEREMONY LIKE WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT VIEWERS CAN EXPECT. >> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, TOM.
STEPHANIE SAYS TUNE INTO ARCHERY. TUNING TOMORROW, GOODNESS ME, BECAUSE IT WILL BE A SPECTACULAR PARADE ON THE RIVER
WITH LeBRON JAMES AND COCO GAUFF WAVING THE FLAG FOR TEAM
USA ON THE SECOND TO LAST BOAT. THAT IS THE TRADITION BECAUSE THE U.S. WILL HOST THE NEXT SUMMER GAMES. 10,000 ATHLETES WILL TAKE PART.
206 COUNTRIES REPRESENTED. THERE WILL BE 94 BOATS. 3000 DANCERS, ARTISTS AND PERFORMERS.
THE ACTUAL LENGTH OF IT ON THE SEINE IS FOR MILES AROUND 326,000 SPECTATORS. AND TOM, MORE THAN 1 BILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD EXPECTED TO WATCH THIS OPENING
CEREMONY. IF THEY DON'T HAVE SEEDS -- I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU, THERE ARE BLEACHERS ON ALMOST EVERY BRIDGE ALONG THE RIVER AND ALL
ALONG THE LEFT AND RIGHT BANK. IF YOU HAVE NOT GOT SEATS, YOU WILL BE WATCHING IT ON TV. PARIS IS READY FOR ITS CLOSE UP, TOM.
>> Reporter: -- >> LIKE WE SAID, NO ONE HAS DONE THIS BEFORE. WE HAVE LOOKING AT THE SENATE. DO YOU THINK PARIS WILL PULL
THIS OFF? >> Reporter: PARIS BELIEVES IT WILL. TODAY I WAS AT AN EVENT, A
SUSTAINABILITY EVENT WITH PRESIDENT MACRON. HE LOOKED INCREDIBLY RELAXED. YOU WOULD NOT KNOW IT WAS THE EVE OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT DAY. I MANAGE TO PUT ASIDE --SPEAK
TO TONY, WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE 24 OLYMPICS, AGAIN, LOOKING RELAXED. I SAID, HOW ARE YOU FEELING? HE TOLD ME, I FEEL GOOD.
PARIS FEELS GOOD. I THINK PARIS IS READY FOR THESE OLYMPICS. HISTORY MAKING OLYMPICS, WHICH WILL VERY LIKELY CHANGE THE WAY WE SEE THE GAMES IN THE FUTURE.
DON'T BE SURPRISE IF WE SEE MORE OPENING CEREMONIES LIKE THIS ONE IN THE OPEN AIR. MORE EVENTS ALL AROUND CITIES THE WAY YOU HAVE SEEN A HERE IN
PARIS.
Officials prepare to protect Olympic games
IT IS NOT AS EXPENSIVE, IT IS MORE SUSTAINABLE, AND GOODNESS ME, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A PARTY, TOM. >> ALL RIGHT, KEIR SIMMONS FROM
PARIS.
WE THANK YOU BOTH FOR GREAT COVERAGE. WE WILL CHECK IN WITH YOU THROUGHOUT THE GAMES OVER THE NEXT TWO WEEKS. >>> SECURITY IN PARIS AHEAD OF
THE OLYMPICS INCREDIBLY TIGHT AS FRENCH OFFICIALS WORK TO PROTECT THE GAMES AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL BACKDROP OF WARS ON TWO CONTINENTS AND ELEVATED TENSIONS AROUND THE GLOBE.
FOR MORE ON THE SECURITY PREPS UNDERWAY HERE IN THE CITY OF LIGHTS WE ARE JOINED BY RICHARD ENGEL, I CAN SEE HERE HE IS
JOINING US HERE ON SET. WHEN YOU WALK AROUND PARIS AND DRIVE AROUND, YOU NOTICE THE SECURITY FORTRESS IT HAS BECOME. GREAT TO HAVE YOU.
LET'S LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. 45,000 POLICE OFFICERS ALONGSIDE 10,000 SOLDIERS, 22,000 PRIVATE SECURITY CONTRACTORS. IT IS A MASSIVE MOBILIZATION. YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO FRENCH
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES. >> Reporter: THEY HAVE DONE A MILLION BACKGROUND CHECKS, DRONE SYSTEMS, ANTI-DRONE SYSTEMS, SONAR IN THE SEINE RIVER, BLOCKS INSIDE THE RIVER
THAT GO ALL THE WAY TO THE BED OF THE RIVER IN CASE PEOPLE
GET IN IT AND THEY WILL NOTICE CHANGES IN THE WATER LEVEL. THERE ARE S.W.A.T. TEAMS, ARMED S.W.A.T. TEAMS, MORE THAN 600 OF THEM
CALLED IN, OR THE COULD BE CALLED AND IF THERE IS A
VIOLENT INCIDENT. THEY ARE VERY WORRIED. THEY'RE VERY WORRIED BECAUSE THERE COULD BE A REPEAT OF THAT TERRIBLE INCIDENT AT THE THEATER WITH ISLAMIC EXTREMIST,
THE FAR LEFT, THE FAR RIGHT. THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A SCENARIO.
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. SO FAR, I HAVE NOT SEEN A LOT OF PROTESTS. THE MAY HAVE UNDER CONTROL. WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.
I KNOW YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ELITE GROUPS THAT ARE PROTECTING PARIS. >> Reporter: THESE ARE THE ELITE S.W.A.T. TEAMS. THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY S.W.A.T.
TEAMS LIKE WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT
IT. THEY DON'T RESPOND TO BANK ROBBERIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THEY ARE COUNTERTERRORISM TEAMS. MORE LIKE THE NAVY SEALS OR DELTA FORCE OR SOMETHING LIKE
THAT. THEY ARE THE SAME FOR THE RESPONDED. THEY ARE TRAINING EVERY DAY, DRILLING FOR HOSTAGE RESCUES OR ANY KIND OF SCENARIO.
YOU ASKED ABOUT THE U.S. MANY COUNTRIES ARE ALSO BRINGING THEIR OWN POLICE OFFICERS AND THE U.S. IS DOING THAT AS WELL.
>> YOU HAVE HIGH PROFILE YOU IS ATHLETES, AND ALSO WE KNOW FRANCE IS ONE OF OUR ALLIES. HOW DO THEY WORK IN COORDINATION?
>> Reporter: VERY CLOSE CORONATION. THE U.S. HAS SET UP A SITUATION ROOM. WE WERE FILMING IN A
TODAY. HAVE MULTIPLE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WORKING THERE IN THE SAME ROOM SO THAT, IF THERE WERE AN INCIDENT, AND THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS
FOCUSING ON AMERICANS, TOURS, DELEGATIONS, THE ATHLETES, THE
FOCUS IS TO IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO AMERICAN CITIZENS. THEY ARE UP AND RUNNING. SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN PARIS WORKING FOR TWO YEARS FOR THIS
WORKING WITH THE FRENCH AUTHORITIES. SO THOSE RELATIONS ARE VERY
STRONG. THERE IS A BASE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY.
SO THEY ARE CONCERNED . IT IS NOT JUST PARIS. SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN IN OTHER CITIES. THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN MAKING ARRESTS. THEY HAVE MADE NUMEROUS ARRESTS
THE LAST 10 DAYS. THREE PEOPLE WHO ALLEGEDLY HAD INTENT TO DISRUPT THE GAMES, INCLUDING A RUSSIAN NATIONAL REPORTEDLY WITH LINKS TO --
>> THEY HAVE THWARTED PLOTS ARE READY. ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR REPORTED. >>> WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE FROM PARIS AT THE COUNTDOWN TO THE OPENING CEREMONY OF THE
OLYMPICS, BUT I WANT TO TURN TO THE MAJOR POLITICAL NEWS BACK HOME. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. SHE POSTED
Kamala Harris: 'Ready to debate' Trump
ON TWITTER SHE IS READY TO DEBATE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THAT HE IS BACKPEDALING FROM HIS COMMITMENT TO FACE-OFF IN SEPTEMBER. THIS AS FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP
DECLARED AT A RALLY LAST NIGHT HE WILL NOT BE NICE AND CRITICIZED HIS OPPONENT JUST DAYS AFTER CALLING FOR UNITY.
TRUCK TONIGHT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WELCOMING AN ON STAGE SHOWDOWN WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, ACCUSING HIM OF BACKPEDALING FROM HIS PREVIOUS COMMITMENT TO A SEPTEMBER
DEBATE. >> READY TO DEBATE DONALD TRUMP. I THINK THE VOTERS DESERVE TO SEE THE SPLIT SCREEN THAT EXISTS IN THIS RACE ON THE
DEBATE STAGE. THAT SO, I AM READY. LET'S GO. >> Reporter: JUST THIS WEEK MR. TRUMP SAID HE WOULD BE WILLING TO DO MORE THAN ONE DEBATE, BUT
HE APPEARED TO BALK AT THE CURRENT PLAN. I AGREE TO A DEBATE WITH JOE BIDEN. BUT I WANT TO BE MADE HER. SHE WILL BE NO DIFFERENT.
BECAUSE I HAVE THE SAME POLICIES. >> Reporter: THE HEAD TO HEAD IS QUICKLY HEATING UP. NEW POLLING SHOWS THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS NARROWED MR.
TRUMP'S ADVANTAGE OVER PRESIDENT BIDEN. THE RACE EFFECTIVELY A TOSS UP. ON THE ACADEMY, HARRIS SLAMMING THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S PROPOSALS AS TAX BREAKS FOR BILLIONAIRES.
>> AMERICA HAS TRIED THESE FAILED ECONOMIC POLICIES BEFORE. BUT WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE NOT GOING BACK.
[ CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ] >> Reporter: MR. TRUMP TODAY ATTACKING THE VICE PRESIDENT. >> SHE IS THE MOST RADICAL PERSON, PROBABLY, THAT WE'VE HAD AN OFFICE, LET ALONE THE
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY. >> Reporter: IN CHARLOTTE LAST NIGHT HE CAST IT ASIDE AS PROMISED FROM LAST WEEK'S REPUBLICAN CONVENTION THAT HE WOULD STRIKE A MORE UNIFIED
TONE. YOU CAN'T BE TOO NICE. YOU REALLY CAN'T BE. IF YOU DON'T IND, I'M NOT GOING TO BE NICE, IS THAT OKAY? >> Reporter: IT COMES AS
PRESIDENT BIDEN DETAILED HIS DECISION TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE. I REVERE THIS OFFICE. BUT I LOVE MY COUNTRY MORE. >> Reporter: DISCUSSING HIS
DESIRE TO UNITE THE COUNTRY BY PASSING THE TORCH TO A NEW GENERATION. >> THERE IS A TIME AND A PLACE FOR NEW VOICES, FRESH VOICES.
YES, YOUNGER VOICES.
THAT TIME AND PLACE IS NOW. >> Reporter: THE VICE PRESIDENT SOON TO RECEIVE A MAJOR BOOST. THE ENDORSEMENT OF FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA, ACCORDING TO
PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR DISCUSSIONS, WHO SAY THEY HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE TOUCH SAID SHE ANNOUNCED HER PLANS TO RUN. TO IN THIS ELECTION, WE EACH
FACE A QUESTION. >> Reporter: THE HARRIS TEAM RUNNING WITH HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN VIDEO. ♪ ♪ MUSIC MET WITH BACK FREEDOM ♪ ♪ WE? THAT TO A BEYONCI■SONG.
MEANWHILE, J.D. VANCE FACING NEW BACKLASH FOR HIS PAST CRITICISM OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS, INCLUDING KAMALA HARRIS, FOR NOT HAVING CHILDREN. >> WE ARE EFFECTIVELY RUINING
THIS COUNTRY VIA THE DEMOCRATS, VIA CORPORATE OLIGARCH, BY A BUNCH OF CHILDLESS CAT LATEST. >> Reporter: JENNIFER ANISTON PERSON, ALL I CAN SAY IS, I
PRAY YOUR DAUGHTER IS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BEAR CHILDREN OF HER OWN ONE DAY. IN A SECOND GENTLEMAN'S FIRST WIFE PRAISING THE VICE PRESIDENT AS A CO-PARENT TO HER
CHILDREN. I LOVE OUR BLENDED FAMILY, AND I AM GRATEFUL TO HAVE HER IN IT."
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN ALREADY THEY ARE EMBRACING A DIFFERENT APPROACH, BOTH STYLISTICALLY AND
STRATEGICALLY. STYLISTICALLY, THE VICE PRESIDENT IS A YOUNGER CANDIDATE EVERYTHING POP CULTURE
, APPEALING TO YOUNGER VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN LESS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT PRESS THE BIDEN. BUT ALSO, PERHAPS, STRATEGICALLY, A DIFFERENT ELECTORAL MAP. THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN HOPING HER
CANDIDACY WILL MOBILIZE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS, PARTICULARLY SOUTHERN BLACK VOTERS IN STATES LIKE GEORGIA WHERE VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WILL HEAD EARLY NEXT WEEK.
>> PETER ALEXANDER, THINKING. FOR MORE ON THE STATE OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE, WANT TO BRING IN NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER FOR THE HILL AND ARE
FRONT TO TOP STORY, JULIA MANCHESTER. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS ACCUSING PRESIDENT TRUMP OF BACKPEDALING ON HIS COMMITMENT TO DEBATE IN SEPTEMBER, ONE DAY AFTER FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID DURING A RALLY HE WILL NOT BE ANYMORE -- WHAT HE HEARD FROM THE CAMPAIGNS ABOUT THE STRATEGIES TO TAKE ON ONE ANOTHER?
>> I THINK FOR BOTH OF THESE CAMPAIGNS THEY ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME FACE-TO-FACE MOMENT. WE SAW HOW CRITICAL THAT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WITH TRUMP
AND BIDEN WAS JUST A MONTH AGO. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH
OF THE CAMPAIGNS. HOWEVER, I THINK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN RIGHT NOW IS MOVING
SOMEWHAT CAUTIOUSLY BECAUSE WE KNOW NOW IS A PERIOD TO DEFINE KAMALA HARRIS. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS FIGURING OUT WHAT THE BEST WAY TO DEFINE
KAMALA HARRIS IS. WE HAVE SEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP LABEL HER, YOU KNOW, HIT HER OVER THE BORDER. YESTERDAY HE LABELED JOE BIDEN AS A FAKE LIBERAL IS THAT
KAMALA HARRIS IS THE REAL LIBERAL TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO EXPERIMENT WITH SOME OF THESE MESSAGES AND SEE WHAT STICKS
AND THEN BRING THAT TO A DEBATE STAGE, IF WE SEE THESE TWO DEBATE. >> A QUICK CORRECTION. I SAID THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO
ATTACKER. HE SAID HE WOULD NOT DEBATE. WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. I ALSO WANT TO PUT UP THE SWING STATE POLLING FROM THE HILL AND
EMERSON. YOU SEE HOW CLOSE IT IS. TRUMP LEAVING HARRIS IN WISCONSIN, ARIZONA, MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA. HARRIS HAVING THE LEAD IN GEORGIA. IT IS ALL WITHIN THE
MARGIN OF ERROR. THAT IS IN ADDITION TO THE POLLS PETER MENTIONED. WHAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT HOW CAMPAIGNS ARE PREPARING FOR THIS CLOSE RACE? >> RIGHT NOW, THE POLLS ARE
REFLECTIVE OF THE FACT WHICH IS SEEING MORE DEMOCRATIC ENTHUSIASM UNDER VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS THEN WE SAW UNDER PRESIDENT BIDEN.
DEMOCRATS I HAVE TALKED TO HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE SWITCH, THIS NIGHT AND DAY SWITCH, THAT STARTED ON SUNDAY WILL PRESIDENT BIDEN STEPPED DOWN FROM THE TOP OF THE TICKET.
YOU'RE ALREADY SEEING THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN REALLY BEGIN TO MOBILIZE, CRISSCROSSING THE
COUNTRY IN HOLDING THESE CAMPAIGN EVENTS WITH AND WITHOUT HER. WE'RE SEEING DOUG EMHOFF, THE SECOND GENTLEMAN. HE HAS BEEN DEPLOYED TO THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
THEY ARE SERIOUSLY HITTING THE GROUND RUNNING KNOWING THAT, QUITE FRANKLY, THEY DON'T HAVE A TON OF TIME LEFT. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN DOING THE SAME THING TRYING TO GET ON THE
GROUND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. I AM CURIOUS ABOUT HOW THIS SHIFTS THE MATH. BEFORE PRESIDENT BIDEN STEPPED DOWN, WHERE HEARING ALL ABOUT THAT BLUE WALL, MICHIGAN,
WISCONSIN AND PENNSYLVANIA AS PRESIDENT BIDEN'S PATH TO
VICTORY. THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN SENT OUT A MEMO THAT WAS STILL THE PAST, HOWEVER, WE SHOULD ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE SUN BELT STATES LIKE NEVADA,
ARIZONA, AND EVEN GEORGIA. A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN KEY CONSTITUENCIES
WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOLD, INCLUDING VOTERS OF COLOR, WHO ARE GALVANIZED RIGHT NOW ABOUT HARRIS. WE HAVE SEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE INROADS WITH THE VOTERS. I AM CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THEY PUSHED BACK IN THE WAKE OF THESE BETTER POLL NUMBERS FOR
KAMALA HARRIS.
>> WE HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH HER VIEW IS FOR YOUR. SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST 2 TO 3 WEEKS IN THIS RACE
THAT YOU LOOK AT THAT POLLING AND WONDER IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS SUNK IN YET . IT IS A
LOT TO THROW AT VOTERS AND WAS. THE REPORTING WHEN IT COMES TO THE VEEPSTAKES. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR, THE GOVERNOR OF
KENTUCKY. HE HAS COME AFTER J.D. VANCE WITH HIS PERSONAL STORY WITH APPALACHIA.
HOW IMPORTANT IS HE TO THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN? >> HE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE IS COMING FROM A RED STATE, A STATE THAT DEMOCRATS TYPICALLY
DON'T WHEN MATT. HE IS A RARE BREED IN KENTUCKY.
THE FACT THAT HE IS ABLE TO HIT J.D. VANCE BECAUSE THEY COME FROM A SIMILAR REGION OF THE COUNTRY, THAT IS PROBABLY PRETTY CRUCIAL.
WE KNOW THAT J.D. VANCE IS GOING TO TRY TO APPEAL TO THESE BLUE WALL VOTERS, THE WORKING-CLASS BLUE-COLLAR VOTERS
THAT PREVIOUSLY WENT FOR DEMOCRATS PRIOR TO 2016. TRUMP WAS ABLE TO FLIP THEM BACK. SINCE THEN, THEY HAVE BEEN SWING VOTERS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HARRIS HAS
SOMEONE LIKE HIM ON HER SIDE. THAT BEING SAID, WE KNOW HIS NAME HAS BEEN THROWN AROUND IN THE VEEPSTAKES. HOWEVER, I AM HEARING THAT IT
IS DOWN AT THIS POINT TO ARIZONA SENATOR MARK KELLY AND
PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO. SHAPIRO, NOTABLY, ONE OF THE HARRIS CIRCUITS. HE WILL BE IN PHILADELPHIA MONDAY. HE CAN VERY MUCH APPEAL TO A LOT OF THOSE BLUE WALL VOTERS
AS WELL. >> I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME OTHER LEADING CANDIDATES YOU HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON. MARK KELLY FROM ARIZONA, JOSH SHAPIRO FROM PENNSYLVANIA.
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT SENATOR MARK KELLY? >> LOOK, I THINK MARK KELLY HAS A VERY COMPELLING STORY.
HE WORKS WITH GABRIELLE GIFFORDS, SHE HAS SINCE BECOME A MAJOR ADVOCATE FOR GUN
VIOLENCE.
-- GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION. THAT IS A CAUSE VERY IMPORTANT TO DEMOCRATIC VOTERS. ALSO, A NUMBER OF MODERATE VOTERS AS WELL. I THINK WE COULD CERTAINLY SEE
HIM BRING THAT TO THE TICKET. HE IS A FORMER ASTRONAUT.
THAT IS CERTAINLY A COMPELLING STORY AS WELL. AND HE COMES FROM A VERY IMPORTANT STATE, ARIZONA. THAT IS A BORDER STATE. WE KNOW MARK KELLY HAS BEEN
CRITICAL OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S HANDLING AT SOME POINTS OF THE SOUTHERN BORDER. HE HAS BEEN MORE HAWKISH ON THAT ISSUE. THAT COULD HELP HER AS WELL.
BUT REALLY, FROM WHAT I AM HEARING, PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO, JUST BECAUSE OF THIS YEAR, I GUESS, MASSIVE THIS OF WHAT PENNSYLVANIA BRINGS, I SHOULD SAY TOTALITY,
OF WHAT PENNSYLVANIA BRINGS TO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, 20 VOTES, A TRUE SWING STATE. I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE CAN TALK ABOUT PATHS TO VICTORY, YOU
Biden pressures Netanyahu for cease-fire
CAN'T REALLY GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT PENNSYLVANIA. MAYBE THERE IS A NARROW PATH, BUT PENNSYLVANIA IS PRETTY BIG. THERE ARE QUESTIONS AS TO, YOU KNOW, WHETHER SOMEONE LIKE JOSH
SHAPIRO COULD WIN THAT FOR HARRIS. >> ALL RIGHT. WE THANK YOU SO MUCH, JULIA MANCHESTER FROM THE HILL. >>> THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER
MEETING WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS PRESIDENT BIDEN TODAY SEPARATELY. BIDEN PRESSING THE PRIME MINISTER FOR AN AND BACK TO THE
WAR IN GAZA AND THE RELEASING OF THE REMAINING HOSTAGES. ANDREA MITCHELL HAS THE DETAILS.

YESTERDAY POLICE USED PEPPER SPRAY AS HUNDREDS DEMONSTRATED AROUND THE CAPITAL.
THEY PAINTED PRO-HAMAS AND ANTI- SEMITIC GRAFFITI, BURNED AN AMERICAN FLAG AND RAISE PALESTINIAN FLAGS.
ACTION STRONGLY CONDEMNED BY CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS FROM BOTH PARTIES AND BY VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS. TODAY THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO PUTTING NETANYAHU ON THE SPOT
BY INVITING AMERICAN HOSTAGE FAMILIES TO MEET WITH HIM AND HE PRESIDENT IN THE CABINET
ROOM. >> WE GOT ABSOLUTE COMMITMENT FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND FROM BY MINISTER NETANYAHU THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF THIS MOMENT NOW.
>> Reporter: HOSTAGES THAT WAS RELEASED SAW THE HORSE
FIRSTHAND. I WANT EVERYBODY TO IMAGINE ANY GIRL THAT IS A YOUNG GIRL THAT HAS NEVER BEEN TOUCHED, SHE IS
LYING ON A MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR AND JUST CRYING, PLEASE,
DON'T DO WHAT HE DID YESTERDAY. I'M VERY WORRIED. I DO NOT WANT THEM TO COME BACK TO.
I WANT ALL THE HOSTAGES TO COME BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE HEAR ABOUT MORE AND MORE OF

PRIME MINISTER A SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE SCALE OF HUMAN SUFFERING IN GAZA,

CHILDREN AND MILITARY FAMILIES. SHE INSTEAD USED IT FOR HER OWN PERSONAL LUXURY FROM HIGH-END JEWELRY AND FANCY CARS TO LAVISH HOMES. >> THIS IS THE LARGEST, THE
LARGEST FRAUD THE UNITED STATES
ARMY HAS SEEN BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL. >> Reporter: WORKING AS A FINANCIAL PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE U.S. ARMY, AREAS INCLUDING YOUTH SERVICES, PROSECUTORS SAY
SHE CREATED A SHAM BUSINESS CALLED CHILD HEALTH AND YOUTH LIFELONG DEVELOPMENT, ADDING

SHE COOPERATED. SHE RETURNED A
Southwest ending open seat boarding
LOT OF THE MONEY. WE EXPECT A LOT MORE WILL BE RETURNED IN THE FUTURE. >> Reporter: PROSECUTORS STANDING FIRM ON THE SENTENCE, SAYING 15 YEARS IS MORE THAN
FAIR.. WE NEED TO SEND A REALLY STRONG MESSAGE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO THIS. WE WILL NOT TOLERATE IT.

SO MANY HAVE BEEN ADDED INTO THE SYSTEM, NOT JUST BY SOUTHWEST, BUT OTHER AIRLINES AS WELL. IT HAS PUT A LID ON AIRFARES..
SOUTHWEST IS BOOKING FOR A SIGN THAT PREMIUM SEATS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE AT SOME POINT NEXT YEAR. THE CHANGE STILL REQUIRES UPDATING CABIN LAYOUTS ND FAA
APPROVAL. BACK TO YOU. >>> NOW TO THE GLOBAL WATCH.

GOOD EVENING ONCE AGAIN FROM PARIS. THAT RIGHT THERE, CHAMPS ELYSEE
LIT UP IN ALL ITS GLORY. YOU CAN SEE THE PARALYMPIC LOGO. WE ARE BACK WITH MORE FROM THE GAMES AS COMPETITIONS GET UNDERWAY AHEAD OF THE OPENING
CEREMONY.
I AM GOING NOW BY MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE ROB HERE IS, A SKY NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT THAT IS JOINING OUR COVERAGE HERE IN PARIS.
FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR JOINING TOP STORIES BUT I WANT TO START WITH THE ATHLETES VILLAGE. THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF
DRAMA. SOMETHING ABOUT THE FOOD. NOW I UNDERSTAND YOUR COLLEAGUES FROM TEAM GREAT BRITAIN WILL ACTUALLY BE FLYING IN A CHEF. WHAT HAPPENED?
>> Reporter: THE BRITS ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE FRENCH CUISINE AT ALL. THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE
QUALITY OF THE FOOD AND THE LACK OF IT IN THE VILLAGE. CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH EGGS AND MAYBE SOME OF THE MEAT IS UNDERCOOKED.
BUT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BASE HERE, A PERFORMANCE LOSS. THEY WILL BRING AN EXTRA CHEF IN. MANY OF THE ATHLETES NOT CHOOSE
-- NOW CHOOSING NOT TO EAT IN
THE VILLAGE. I WONDER HOW IT WILL GO DOWN WITH A FRIEND. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT TEAM USA FOR A LITTLE BIT. WE HAD WOMEN SOCCER TODAY.
TEAM USA COMING OUT VERY STRONG. 3-0 AGAINST ZAMBIA. TELL US ABOUT THE COACH.

TITLES IN A ROW. SHE IS A FORMIDABLE CHARACTER. I INTERVIEWED HER JUST AFTER SHE TOOK THE U.S. JOB. SHE SPEAKS HER MIND.

WHAT A START HERE WITH THE VICTORY. >> YOU ALSO BEEN COVERING DOPING AT THE CASE. IT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE OVER THE
LAST SEVERAL GAMES. STAR SWIMMER FOR TEAM USA HAS EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT WHO IS
ON WHAT. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED? >> Reporter: THERE IS A HUGE
LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ANTI DOPING AGENCY. 23 CHINESE LEARNERS TESTED POSITIVE IN TOKYO.
WE DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS UNTIL A FEW MONTHS AGO WHEN THE CASES WERE REVEALED. 11 OF THOSE SWIMMERS ARE HERE. THE WORLD ANTI-DOPING AGENCY
AND OTHER AUTHORITIES WERE CONTAMINATED BY FOOD AT HOTELS.
IT IS QUESTIONING THE CONFIDENCE OF THE DOPING AUTHORITIES. THE AWARDING OF THE WINTER GAMES TO SALT LAKE CITY IN 2024 WITH PART OF THE AGREEMENT THAT
THE U.S. REMOVED THE LAW THAT
CAN PROSECUTE CRIMINAL CASES FOR DOPING. >> THAT WOULD BE SO WILD IF THAT HAPPENED. AND WHAT ASK ABOUT SOME OF HER STAR ALPHAS, INCLUDING WOMEN
SCHOLASTICS AND MEN'S BASKETBALL. DOES TEAM USA HAVE A IN GYMNASTICS? CAN ANYBODY ELSE COMPETE?
>> Reporter: A BRITISH STAR WILL BE PRETTY STRONG IN GYMNASTICS. BUT A LOT OF -- WE ALL SAW THE
EVENT TO TOKYO, HOW SIMONE BILES CAME BACK FROM ADVERSITY. I THINK SHE IS REALLY INSPIRATIONAL IN THAT SENSE. IT TURNS A BASKETBALL, THE LAST
TIME WE SAW LeBRON, HARRY IS BACK AGAIN TO GET GOLD.
CERTAINLY, SOMEONE TO KEEP AN EYE OUT. BECAUSE SOME INTERNATIONAL TEAMS CAN GIVE THEM A RUN FOR
THE MONEY. FRANCE AND OTHER EUROPEAN TEAMS ARE PLAYING GREAT BASKETBALL WITH NBA STARS. >> Reporter: SO MANY MORE
FOREIGN STARS COME INTO PLAY HERE. THEY'RE GETTING STRONGER BEEFING UP THE NATIONAL TEAMS.
IT IS POSING A CHALLENGE TO THE WEST. -- U.S. >> IT IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST
