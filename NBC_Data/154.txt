STONE CANYON FIRE HAS BURNED OVER 1000 ACRES OF LAND SINCE IT BEGAN YESTERDAY.
AT LEAST ONE PERSON HAS DIED SO FAR. OFFICIALS THERE SAY HUMAN REMAINS WERE FOUND INSIDE OF THE HOMES.
NEARBY THE COREY FIRE IS BURNING FAST, FIREFIGHTERS BANGING ON DOORS TO GET PEOPLE
OUT IN TIME. >> CURRENTLY OVER 200 ACRES. AND IT WILL GROW.
THERE IS NO DOUBT. THIS IS A COMPLEX FIRE EXHIBITING EXTREME
FIRE BEHAVIOR NOT CONDUCIVE TO A GROUND ATTACK. >> NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, LIZ
KREUTZ JOINS US NOW. WHAT'S HAPPENING WHERE YOU ARE?
>> Reporter: HEY, VALERIE. THIS FIRE IS STILL REALLY ACTIVE. YOU CAN SEE THE MASSIVE PLUME OF SMOKE THERE. THEY'VE BEEN
DOING AIR DROPS AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGHT THIS FIRE FROM THE AIR AND THE GROUND. BUT, IT IS A CHALLENGING FIRE FOR MANY REASONS.
IT IS ABOUT 200 ACRES OR MORE AT THIS POINT.
IT IS A CHALLENGING, OFFICIALS SAY, BECAUSE IT IS THREATENING HOMES AND PROPERTY. AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS AREA THAT'S UNIQUE AS WELL
IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF RATTLESNAKES IN THIS AREA, IN
AN AREA CALLED "RATTLESNAKE GOALS." IS MAKING IT INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS FOR FIREFIGHTERS AS
WELL TO FICUS FIRE ON THE GROUND. SO A LOT OF THINGS ARE WORKING AGAINST THESE FIREFIGHTERS RIGHT NOW.
MANY REMAIN EVACUATED AT THIS HOUR AS THEY TRIED TO GET IT
UNDER CONTROL. >> IT'S BEEN A FEW BUSY DAYS IN COLORADO. DO FIRE CREWS HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO BATTLE ALL OF THEM?
>> Reporter: YEAH, BOTH FIRES IN THIS AREA LIKE YOU
MENTIONED, ONE TURNED DEADLY VERY SADLY, BUT, IT'S BEEN A
CHALLENGE. OFFICIALS WERE BRINGING UP TODAY, WATCHING SOME OF THE PRESS CONFERENCES WITH THE OFFICIALS, THIS MORNING THEY WERE ASKING FOR AIR RESOURCES.
WE CAN SEE THEY HAVE THEM, BUT THEY SAID IT WAS A CONCERN. THEY HAD AROUND 70-ISH FIREFIGHTERS. THERE ARE MULTIPLE
FIREFIGHTERS FROM COLORADO OUT OF STATE BATTLING OTHER FIRES, SO WE KNOW THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE. THE GOVERNOR OF COLORADO HAS CALLED IN THE NATIONAL GUARD TO
HELP MANAGE AND DO SOME OF THE LOGISTICS AROUND FIGHTING THE FIRES AS WELL. >> AND LIZ, WE ANCIENT THE PARK
FIRE IN CALIFORNIA THAT CONTINUES TO CAUSE DAMAGE.
>> Reporter: YEAH, THE GOOD NEWS THERE, VALERIE, THERE HAS
BEEN A HEALTHY AMOUNT OF PROGRESSION ON CONTAINMENT
SINCE IT STARTED.
IT IS NOW THE FIFTH LARGEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. AS YOU MENTIONED PEOPLE ARE RETURNING HOME. IT'S WILD THOUGH, VALERIE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FIRE SEASON
. IN CALIFORNIA, THIS YEAR, 30 TIMES MORE ACRES HAVE BURNED ALREADY THIS YEAR THAN ALL OF LAST YEAR, AND WE ARE ONLY
HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR. IT WILL BE A PRETTY INTENSE FIRE SEASON TO COME FOR THE NEXT
FEW MONTHS IN CALIFORNIA, AND ACROSS THE WEST WHERE ALMOST 100 WILDFIRES ARE BURNING RIGHT NOW, VALERIE.

ATTEMPT A FEW WEEKS AGO, A TRIUMPHANT RETURN WITH SECURITY MEASURES, BUT HIS FIRST STOP OF THE DAY IS GENERATING MORE HEADLINES. HE WAS IN CHICAGO AT THE ANNUAL
CONVENTION OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS. HE MADE A NUMBER OF COMMENTS MANY READ AS INCENDIARY. SUCH AS
KAMALA HARRIS ONLY ON THE TICKET, BECAUSE SHE IS A WOMAN OF COLOR.
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS OF INDIAN HERITAGE. AND SHE WAS ONLY PROMOTING
INDIAN HERITAGE. I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS BLACK, UNTIL A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN SHE HAPPENED TO TURN BLAC
. SO I DON'T KNOW, IS SHE INDIAN, OR IS SHE BLACK?
I RESPECT EITHER ONE, BUT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T SHE WAS
INDIAN ALL THE WAY, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE MADE A TURN, AND SHE BECAME A BLACK PERSON. >> JUST TO BE CLEAR-- >> LET'S BRING IN TRENT A
CORRESPONDENT, YAMICHE ALCINDOR. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE COMMENTS
MADE AND HIS APPEARANCE IN THE ROOM. >> Reporter: IN THE ROOM PEOPLE
WERE REALLY STUNNED, BECAUSE HE WAS QUESTIONING THE RACIAL
IDENTITY OF VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS, SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR AND VERY ARTICULATE ABOUT HER BACK STORY, ABOUT HOW HER PARENTS MET, HER MOTHER WAS
INDIAN, HER FATHER WAS OF JAMAICAN DISSENT. PEOPLE WERE CURIOUS, OFFENDED,
OR VERY MUCH OFFENDED, VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS HAS NOT ONLY
ATTENDED HOWARD UNIVERSITY, HBCU , SHE JOINED A HBCU
SORORITY. TAKE A LISTEN TO SOME OF THIS EXCHANGE. >> COMING FROM THE BORDER ARE
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO E TAKING BLACK
JOBS. >> WHAT IS A BLACK JOB SEARCH MARK >> THAT'S ANYBODY THAT HAS A JOB, THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
EMPLOYMENT TAKING AWAY FROM BLACK PEOPLE. >> THERE WERE A FEW MORE YOU
CAN HEAR, WHO WERE REALLY STUNNED BY SOME OF THE ANSWERS HE WAS GIVING, AT ONE POINT HE WAS INSULTING THE ASSOCIATION
OF BLACK JOURNALISTS SAYING THE INTERVIEW STARTED LATE BECAUSE
OF AUDIO ISSUES. HE KEPT SAYING THERE WERE AUDIO ISSUES. SOMEONE SITTING IN THE ROOM, NOT MORE THAN 20 FEET FROM HIM, THERE WERE NO AUDIO ISSUES.
HE ARRIVED LATE FROM OUR
UNDERSTANDING. THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH, AND PEOPLE WERE REALLY NOT HAPPY WITH THE WAY THIS TURNED OUT. >> AND HIS APPEARANCE ACTUALLY
ALSO ENDED EARLY, RIGHT? >> THAT'S RIGHT. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE AND
HAVE AN HOUR LONG INTERVIEW, AND THEY CUT IT OFF AT ABOUT 34 MINUTES. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT
WAS, WAS IT TO BLAME FOR STARTING LATE, THAT IT GOT
CONTENTIOUS THAT HIS TEAM THOUGHT IT WAS NOT BENEFICIAL FOR HIM TO BE ON THE STAGE? I WAS SPEAKING WITH A NUMBER OF HARRIS ALLIES IN REAL TIME
TALKING WITH THEM. THEY WERE SAYING TRUMP IS UNHINGED, THIS IS A COMPLETE TRAIN WRECK FOR HIM, THIS MAKES
HIM LOOK TERRIBLE, SO DEMOCRATS WERE SAYING THIS WON'T HELP HIM WIN OVER NEW VOTERS, AND THAT'S
OF COURSE WHAT HE HAS TO DO TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. >> WE HEARD THE COMMENTS HE
MADE ABOUT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS. HAS SHE RESPONDED TO HIS CLAIMS? >> YES, THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN HAS
PUT OUT A STATEMENT, THEY WERE SAYING IT WAS INSULTING, THAT IT WAS A WRONG THING FOR DONALD TRUMP, I WANT TO READ. TODAY'S TIRADE IS TASTE OF THE
CHAOS AND TRUMP'S MAGA RALLYING CAMPAIGN. AS VICE PRESIDENT
HARRIS OFFERS A VISION OF OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM FOR ALL AMERICANS.
THEY ENDED BY CHALLENGING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TO GO TO THE DEBATE STAGE ON SEPTEMBER 10th.
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT BIDEN. NOW FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
MAKING EXCUSES SAYING HARRIS IS NOW OFFICIALLY THE NOMINEE.
IT COMES DOWN TO HARRIS SAYING SAY THIS TO MY FACE. IN SOME WAYS, GOADING DONALD
TRUMP TO THE DEBATE STAGE. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHANTING "HE'S SCARED." SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY
Harris to tour swing states
LEANING INTO THAT MESSAGING. >> YAMICHE ALCINDOR THINK LIKE
YOU. >>> TURNING TO VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS, TONIGHT SHE'S OFFICIALLY THE ONLY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR RESIDENT. A KEY DEADLINE PASSED WITH NO
WINDOWS QUALIFYING. THE DNC SAYS 90% OF DELEGATES ARE SUPPORTING HER. MEANWHILE WE ARE JUST DAYS AWAY
FROM LEARNING HER VP PICK NEXT WEEK SHE'S EXPECTED TO HOLD A RALLY WITH HER CHOICE IN PHILADELPHIA. THAT WILL KICK
OFF A TOUR FOR THE DUO IN SIX OTHER SWING STATES. NBC NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST,
SORORITY IN TEXAS. WHAT DO WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM HER? >> YEAH, THE VP, HER CAMPAIGN
SAYING THEY RAISED $2.5 MILLION AFTER AN EVENT. FOR THOSE WHO
DON'T KNOW HBCU FRATERNITIES
AND SORORITIES ARE A GATHERING. THEY HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO AS A
CORE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT FROM HERS TO REALLY HIT ALL THE ISSUES
THAT SHE HAS MADE A PRIORITY IN HER TIME AS VICE PRESIDENT.
LIKE MATERNAL HEALTH, TALKING ABOUT HER EFFORTS THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION TO POINT OUT THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST AMONG
BLACK WOMEN WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER COMPLICATIONS RELATED
TO PREGNANCY. EFFORTS REGARDING PROJECT RIGHTS. SHE'S BEEN A CHAMPION, AND NOW WITHIN HER OWN CAMPAIGN.
TO DRIVE THIS CONTRAST BETWEEN HERSELF AND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SHE OFTEN FRAMES STRING TO TAKE AMERICA BACK TO THE
PAST WHILE SHE IS FOCUSED MAINLY ON THE FUTURE. SO THESE CEREMONIES HAVE BEEN
UP OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY TO SPEAK TO A COALITION OF VOTERS CRITICAL TO HER BASE BUT
SHARPENING HER MESSAGE AS HER CAMPAIGN GETS UP AND RUNNING. >> LET'S TURN NOW TO THE
>> NOW IS RAW. DID WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SWING STATE TO HER, AND WE HAVE INDICATIONS ON WHO SHE IS
LEANING TOWARDS? >> WE KNOW THE SWING STATES TOUR IS DESIGNED TO BE A SHOW
OF FORCE FOR HARRIS AND HER POTENTIAL RUNNING MATE. SORT OF A SIGNAL TO VOTERS
NATIONWIDE THEY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT WINNING AS MANY VOTERS AS THEY CAN AND SPEAKING TO AS MANY VOTERS AS THEY CAN. WHAT WE KNOW IS NEXT TUESDAY IN
PHILADELPHIA, THE CAMPAIGN HAS SAID SHE WILL HAVE HER RUNNING MATE BY THAT DAY. AND EVEN THOUGH THIS IS TAKING
PLACE IN PENNSYLVANIA WE SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY ASSUME JOSH SHAPIRO IS GOING TO BE THE
PICK. SO WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT
SHAPIRO IS STILL A TOP CONTENDER, AS IS MARK KELLY,
WHO NBC NEWS REPORTED, WOULD HELP HER WITH ISSUES ON THE BORDER. AND HARRIS HERSELF SAID
YESTERDAY THIS IS STILL A DECISION THAT'S ACTIVELY BEING MADE. SHE SAID TODAY SHE HAS NOT MADE
THAT DECISION. LIKE YOU MENTIONED, WE WILL KNOW WHAT THE TICKET WILL LOOK
LIKE. >> IN OTHER NEWS TODAY SECRET SERVICE WHISKED AWAY FIRST GENTLEMAN DOUG EMHOFF'S DAUGHTER
FROM A NEW YORK CITY RESTAURANT. >> YEAH, EARLIER TODAY. A MAN ONLY UNPROVOKED CAME AND
TEMPERED WITH LICENSE PLATES ON TWO SECRET SERVICE VEHICLES. THE AGENT SAID THERE'S NO
INDICATION THIS WAS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED OR THIS MAN KNEW WHO WAS IN THE CAR, BUT EITHER WAY
HE WAS DETAINED, AND AUTHORITIES TOOK HIM INTO

WORKING ON IT. >> 84-YEAR-OLD ODED LIFSHITZ
HAS BEEN HELD IN GAZA. WE MET DANIEL, HIS GRANDSON. DO YOU THINK BENJAMIN NETANYAHU

ABOUT GETTING THE HOSTAGES ON THE AMERICANS NEED TO MAKE ALL THE NECESSARY PRESSURE THAT HE
WILL DO SO.
>> Reporter: IN BEIRUT, THE CAPITAL OF LEBANON, HEZBOLLAH CONFIRMING ONE OF ITS TOP COMMANDERS WAS KILLED BY AN ISRAELI STRIKE. ISRAEL SAYS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DEATHS OF 12 CHILDREN IN A ROCKET ATTACK BUT LEBANON SAYS THIS BROTHER AND SISTER WERE
ALSO KILLED IN THE ISRAELI BOMBING. CYCLE OF REVENGE

CITIZENS, GET OUT OF SOUTH LEBANON, BECAUSE NEW FIGHTING MAY BE ABOUT TO ERUPT. BACK TO YOU. >> RAF, THANK YOU.
ELISE, THANKS FOR BEING WITH US TONIGHT. EXPLAIN HOW THESE GROUPS ARE
INTERTWINED. >> THEY ARE KIND OF ALL
SUPPORTED BY IRAN. HEZBOLLAH IS A PROXY AND DOES ATTACKS ON ITS BEHALF, ALSO
INVOLVED IN SYRIA, AND THE ATTACKS ARE AT THE DIRECTION OF
IRAN WHILE HAMAS IS MORE OF A PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE GROUP, ALSO A TERRORIST GROUP, BUT
MORE ABOUT PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE, BUT ALSO IS SUPPORTED BY IRAN. NOW ISRAEL IS FACING TWO
CONFLICTS, ONE ON THE NORTH AND ONE IN THE SOUTH.
BOTH SUPPORTED BY IRAN. >> WHAT COULD ISRAEL'S STRATEGY BE IF THEY ARE BEHIND THE STRIKE IN IRAN MARK WAS A BAD
CALL ON THEIR PART? >> I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A BAD CALL. I MEAN LOOK, THEY HAVEN'T SAID
THEY HAVE DONE IT, BUT PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU HAS PROMISED TO QUOTE UNQUOTE DECAPITATE
HAMAS LEADERSHIP. SO IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME
ISRAEL WAS BEHIND IT. I THINK THAT IS WHAT THE
ISRAELIS WANTED. I'M QUESTIONING THE TIMING THOUGH, BECAUSE YOU DID HAVE THE CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON THAT THE ISRAELIS AND
REPORTEDLY HAMAS OR CLOSE TO A DEAL THAT WOULD HAVE A CEASE FIRE, AND A RELEASE OF THESE
HOSTAGES. YOU WOULD WONDER WHY THEY DIDN'T WAIT TILL NEGOTIATIONS WERE THROUGH, BUT THEY SAW A
TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY. GROWING
RELATIONS WITH QATAR, SO THEY DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET QATAR, AND
THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH EGYPT. I THINK THIS WAS AN ATTACK OF
OPPORTUNITY. >> AND HOW COULD NEGOTIATIONS
BE IMPACTED?
>> IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO DELAY IT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL REALLY CANCEL OR HALT IT. IT COULD DERAIL IT TEMPORARILY. YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER ISMAIL
HANIYEH WAS INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATIONS, BUT THE MILITARY
WING WAS SEEN AS THE ONE WHO MAKES THE CALL ON THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND WHETHER THERE BE A CEASE-FIRE AND HOSTAGE
RELEASE. I DO THINK IT WILL NOT ONLY DERAIL NEGOTIATIONS
TEMPORARILY, BUT IT'S ALSO JUST
GOING TO CAUSE A LOT OF CHAOS WITHIN HAMAS ITSELF, BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF JOCKEYING FOR POWER, AND SO I THINK IT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO
DELAY ANY CEASE-FIRE, OR ANY RELEASE OF THOSE HOSTAGES, UNFORTUNATELY. >> WHERE DOES THE U.S. STAND ON
ALL OF THIS? >> LOOK, I MEAN, THE U.S. HAS BEEN TRAINED TO NEGOTIATE THIS
CEASE-FIRE DEAL. EVEN BEFORE OCTOBER 7th, BUT CERTAINLY AFTER TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A
BORDER AGREEMENT WITH HEZBOLLAH AND ISRAEL IN TERMS OF TRYING
TO GET A BUFFER ZONE AND TRYING TO GET ISRAEL TO STAND DOWN ON
ITS OVER PLACE OF LEBANON, THIS MAKES IT MUCH MORE COMPLICATED.
THE U.S. HAS ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS THAT HAVE SPOKEN TO, THEY HAVE BEEN CAUTIONING
ISRAEL AGAINST THESE ATTACKS WHICH WOULD ESCALATE THE SITUATION. THERE HAS BEEN, NOT A PIECE BUT
CERTAINLY RESTRAIN BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HEZBOLLAH.
NEITHER ONE HAS WANTED TO GO INTO FULL-OUT WAR. ALL BETS ARE OFF RIGHT NOW.

TWO UNFORTUNATELY HAVE DIED IN THIS VERY LARGE OUTBREAK.
WE NEED SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE OUR FOODS ARE SAFE AS

OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES. WHAT ARE THE CHANGES YOU OBSERVED RECENTLY THAT ARE I IMAGINE QUITE DIFFERENT THAN INDICATES PRAYER? >> 1948, 1990, IT WAS, IN 2010

FOR SEA LIONS ON THE SEA ICE.
>> HOMES ARE CRUMBLING, HOMES ARE SKEWING, BECAUSE THE ICE
THAT USED TWO SLOW THIS WELL IS NOT THERE ANYMORE. >> Reporter: AND IT'S PLAYING OUT ACROSS THE ENTIRE ARCTIC.
>> PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THE ARCTIC IS CHANGING FASTER THAN
ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET. WERE THESE BRIGHT SERVICES ARE IT'S MAKING US DARKER. MORE OF THE SUN'S ENERGY IS
BEING ABSORBED WHETHER IT IS OCEAN ORELAND.
>> DARKER COLORS ABSORBED MORE OF THE SUN'S ENERGY WHILE WHITE
AND LIGHTER COLORS REFLECT THAT HEAT HELPING YOU STAY COOLERS. GLACIERS WORK THE SAME WAY
REFLECTING THAT ENERGY BACK TO SPACE. THE MORE THAT WE LOSE THE HOTTER EARTH GETS, ACCELERATING CLIMATE CHANGE.
EVEN THESE RULES OF CLIMATE CHANGE SEEMED TO BE BREAKING DOWN IN PARTS OF THE ARC TAKE.
>> THEIR TEAM RETURNED FROM AN
EXPEDITION IN NORWAY. >> SVALBARD IS AN AREA WE CALL
A HOTSPOT.
I DON'T WANT TO SAY CLIMATE CHANGE IS TRIGGERING IT, BUT
THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP WE ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. >> Reporter: AN ARC TAKE
ANOMALY OR FORECAST FOR THE FUTURE? ONE THING IS CLEAR. WE ARE FACING A RAPIDLY CHANGING AND UNPREDICTABLE ARCTIC WITH FOUR-REACHING EFFECTS.
>> CHASE JOINS ME NOW FROM LOS ANGELES. THOSE EFFECTS ON THE WORLD'S CLIMATE OR SOMETHING YOU HAVE
BEEN TRACKING THE SUMMER. >> THAT'S RIGHT, VALERIE. IF WE LOOK, LAST WEEK, WE WERE
SEEING TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80s AND EVEN 90 DEGREES. MANY IN THE LOWER 48 MIGHT THINK THAT'S NOT THAT HOT, BUT
THESE TEMPERATURES ARE 16 DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE. WHEN WE
ZOOM OUT AND LOOK AT JUST LAST YEAR ACROSS THE ARCTIC THE ARCTIC CIRCLE SAW ITS SIXTH
WARMEST YEAR. LAST SUMMER IN THE ARCTIC IT WAS THE WARMEST
SUMMER EVER RECORDED, AND THAT'S IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THAT'S THE TIME OF YEAR WHERE YOU WILL SEE MOST OF THE POLAR ICE, THESE
GLACIERS, MELTING. FURTHER, OVER THE LAST CENTURY OR SO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN
THE ARCTIC, YOU SEE HOW QUICKLY IT IS WARMING. IN THE LAST 40 YEARS THE
WARMING BY NEARLY SIX EGREES,
THAT IS WARMER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET, AND LONG TERM SOLUTION IS THAT WE HAVE
TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS, COAL, GAS.

TEENAGERS WHO WENT ON A PHONE FAST TO SEE IF IT IMPROVED THEIR MENTAL HEALTH, BUT WHAT ARE SCHOOLS DOING BUT THE
CRISIS? SCHOOL PRINCIPALS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE EFFECTS.
HUNDREDS OF ADMINISTRATORS WERE SURVEYED ABOUT THE ISSUE.
>> Reporter: HALFWAY THROUGH THE SUMMER THE SOUND OF THE SCHOOL BELL SEEMS LIKE A DISTANT MEMORY, BUT THIS SUMMER, ACROSS THE TRI-STATE
AND ACROSS THE NATION ADMINISTRATORS ARE WRESTLING WITH THE QUESTION, SHOULD THEY CHANGE THEIR POLICIES ON PHONES?
>> OUR KIDS ARE FULLY ADDICTED TO THESE PHONES. WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. >> Reporter: DAVID BANKS ISN'T THE ONLY ONE CONCERNED PHONES
ARE HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT. OVER THE LAST MONTH MORE THAN
500 ELEMENTARY, MIDDLE, AND HIGH SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TOOK AN EXCLUSIVE NBC NEWS NOW SURVEY. AMONG THE RESULTS 74% OF
PRINCIPALS AND VICE PRINCIPALS THINK THESE PHONES ARE MAKING STUDENTS DEPRESSED, ANXIOUS,
LONELY, DISTRACTED, OR TIRED. 85% OF PRINCIPALS THINK PHONES
ARE AMPLIFYING CONFLICT OR BULLYING. >> THE FIGHT IN THE CAFETERIA,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT IS TRENDING. >> Reporter: THIS PRINCIPAL
TOLD US ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH PHONES IN SCHOOLS IS THEY TEND TO AMPLIFY CONFLICTS.
>> WHEN THE PHONES WERE EVERYWHERE IN THIS SCHOOL BUILDING WITH THE CASE THE WORST THING HAPPENED DURING THE
DAY, SCROLLED ACROSS EVERY KIT'S PHONE? IT WAS A RACE TO THE BOTTOM.
>> IT WAS NEGATIVE, IT WAS VIOLENT, OR IT WAS VOLLEYING. >> Reporter: SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ALSO ANSWERED
AN OPEN-ENDED QUESTION WITH REVEALING ANSWERS, ONE OF THEM WRITING SMART PHONES ARE CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASED VAPING IN DRUG USE IN SCHOOLS,
BECAUSE STUDENTS CAN TEXT OR MESSAGE EACH OTHER TO COORDINATE
SELLING AND USING SUBSTANCES. IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THE INFLUENCE ON MY STUDENTS IS
RIDICULOUS, THEY THINK RECESS IS BORING. I WORRY ABOUT THE FUTURE. DISTRACTIONS IN SCHOOLS WON'T
ALWAYS COME FROM OTHER STUDENTS. 65 PERCENT OF ADMINISTRATORS WE SURVEYED SAID STUDENTS RECEIVE
DAILY CALLS OR TEXTS FROM THEIR PARENTS DURING INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. EVEN IN THE CASE OF A
CATASTROPHE LIKE A SCHOOL SHOOTING A PERCENT OF THE ADMINISTRATORS IN OUR SURVEY SAID IT IS SAFER FOR STUDENTS TO STAY OFF PHONES AND STAY
FOCUSED ON INSTRUCTIONS INSIDE THE CLASSROOM. THE SURVEY REVEALED A MISMATCH
IN HOW OLD KIDS ARE WHEN THEY GET PHONES AND HOW OLD SCHOOL
LEADERS THINK THEY SHOULD BE. OVER 70% OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WE SURVEYED SAID MOST KIDS GET THEIR PHONES AT
10 OR YOUNGER. MORE THAN 70% SAID THEY BELIEVE THE RIGHT AGE TO GET PHONES WAS 14 OR OLDER.
THE BIGGEST PERCENTAGE SAID 16 WAS THE RIGHT AGE. WE'VE BEEN GIVING PHONES TO
KIDS WAY TOO EARLY. >> ONE ADMINISTRATOR WROTE I'VE NEVER HEARD A PARENT SAY THEY
REGRETTED WAITING TO GET THEIR CHILD A PHONE OR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCESS, BUT I CAN'T COUNT HOW MANY REGRET GIVING THEIR CHILD
A PHONE AT A YOUNG AGE. >> WE WANT THEM TO BE HEALTHY.
>> Reporter: ADMINISTRATORS BAND PHONES DURING THE SCHOOL DAY. NEARLY 2/3 OF PRINCIPALS AND
VICE PRINCIPALS SUPPORT THAT IDEA.

EXPECTING THE OPENING CEREMONY, IN PARIS, A COLD IN SURPRISE, A BALLOON STEPS FROM THE LOUVRE AND A FLOATING OLYMPIC FLAME
FOR THAT GOLDEN BALLOON IS MORE THAN AN OLYMPIC TORCH, IT'S A TRIBUTE TO THE BRAVE PARISIANS, THESE FIRST HUMANS TO EVER TAKE FLIGHT, AND SOME OF THEM TOOK
OFF FROM THIS VERY GARDEN 240 YEARS AGO. BACK THEN, THE FRENCH WERE
MASTERS OF THE HEAVENS. THE WRIGHT BROTHERS HAD WINGS,
BUT THE FIRST OF BALLOON TOOK
OFF LONG BEFORE. >> IT LOOKS LIKE A CELESTIAL BODY. >> EXACTLY.
