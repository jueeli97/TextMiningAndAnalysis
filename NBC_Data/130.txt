>>> VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA
HARRIS AND FORMER PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP BOTH CAMPAIGNING
TODAY WITH 97 DAYS TO GO UNTIL
THE ELECTION.
>> THE FORMER PRESIDENT SPOKE
AT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR
BLACK JOURNALISTS, A CONFERENCE
HAPPENING IN CHICAGO THIS
AFTERNOON.
MR. TRUMP WAS ASKED IF VICE
PRESIDENT HARRIS WAS ONLY ON
THE TICKET BECAUSE SHE IS A
BLACK WOMAN.
HERE IS HOW HE RESPONDED.
>> SHE WAS ALWAYS OF INDIAN
HERITAGE AND ONLY PROMOTING
INDIAN HERITAGE.
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS BLACK
UNTIL A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO
WHEN SHE HAPPENED TO TURN BLACK
AND NOW SHE WANTS TO BE KNOWN
AS BLACK.
IS SHE INDIAN OR IS SHE BLACK?
>> VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRI
, OF COURSE, IS BIRACIAL.
>> LET'S BRING IN HALLIE
JACKSON, ANCHOR OF HALLIE
JACKSON NOW.
THAT INTERVIEW JUST HAPPENED
WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS
AND IT'S ALREADY GETTING A LOT
OF ATTENTION.
IT WAS HEATED FROM THE START.
HE WAS CONTENTIOUS WITH THE
WOMAN ASKING THE QUESTIONS.
WHAT ELSE DID WE HEAR?
>> Reporter: YOU ARE EXACTLY
RIGHT, KATE AND ZINHLE.
TAKING EXCEPTION TO THE
QUESTION POSED BY RACHEL SCOTT
OF ABC NEWS, A JOURNALIST WHO
COVERS WASHINGTON AND THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN ALONG WITH TWO OTHER
JOURNALISTS ON THAT STAGE.
YOU PLAYED A LITTLE BIT OF ONE
OF THE REMARKS GETTING A LOT OF
ATTENTION REGARDING VICE
PRESIDENT HARRIS' RACE AND HOW
SHE IDENTIFIES.
BASED ON OUR TEAM'S REPORTING,
THOSE CLOSE TO THE VICE
PRESIDENT ARE CALLING WHAT
HAPPENED AT THIS NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS
CONFERENCE A DISASTER.
I THINK WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE
TO PLAY OF THE FORMER
PRESIDENT'S INTERACTIONS HERE
ON STAGE.
WATCH.
I THINK WE ACTUALLY DO NOT HAVE
THAT BUT I WILL WANT TO TELL
YOU HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT OTHER
TOPICS INCLUDING WHAT IS
GETTING SOME ATTENTION, REMARKS
ABOUT J.D.
VANCE.
HE WAS PRESSED REPEATEDLY ABOUT
COMMENTS THAT HIS NOW CURRENT,
OF COURSE, GOP NOMINEE SAID
ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE
CHILDREN, A DESCRIPTION OF
CHILDLESS CAT LADIES. THE
FORMER PRESIDENT DEFENDED VANCE
ON THIS AND IT SUGGESTED A VICE
PRESIDENTIAL SELECTION IN HIS
VIEW DOES NOT REALLY MATTER,
KATE AND ZINHLE, FROM A
POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE . HE SAID
OTHER THAN THE INITIAL BUG YOU
GET FROM ANNOUNCING A RUNNING
MATE, TYPICALLY PEOPLE VOTE FOR
WHO IS AT THE TOP OF THE TICKE
, NOT FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL
SELECTION.
INTERESTING DYNAMIC, SOMETHING
YOU DON'T OFTEN HEAR, SOMEONE
SAYING THEIR RUNNING MATE IS
IRRELEVANT BUT THAT IS WHAT THE
FORMER PRESIDENT SUGGESTED TODAY
. WE ARE GETTING WORD IN THE
LAST FEW MINUTES, YOU MAY HAVE
NOTICED IF YOU WATCHED THAT
CONVENTION AT ALL THE PANEL
DISCUSSION WAS CUT SHORT
ABRUPTLY.
IT STARTED QUITE LATE BECAUSE
OF AUDIO ISSUES AND ONE OF THE
JOURNALISTS ON STAGE SUGGESTED
SHE WAS HAVING AUDIO ISSUES
THERE.
WE ARE HEARING FROM THE FORMER
PRESIDENT'S TEAM THEY CUT IT
SHORT AND MOVED ON BECAUSE THEY
HAD A RALLY TO GET TO IN
PENNSYLVANIA TONIGHT.
THEY'VE GOT A KEY BATTLEGROUND
RALLY THERE BUT THEY CUT IT
SHORT TO GET TO THE RALLY
POINTING OUT THE EVENT STARTED
40 SOME MINUTES LATE.
WATCHING IT, IT REMINDED ME OF
THE KIND OF DONALD TRUMP WE SAW
IN 2015, 2016.
VERY COMBATIVE AND CONTENTIOUS
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.
>> CERTAINLY HIS PRESENT STRONG
CONTROVERSY.
EVEN PROTESTS OUTSIDE THE
CONVENTION.
HALLIE, LET'S BACK UP . BIG
PICTURE HERE, WE ARE 10 DAYS
INTO THIS NEW PRESIDENTIAL RAC
. HOW HAVE THE CAMPAIGN
STRATEGI BEYOND THE PEOPLE,
RIGHT, SHIFTED WHEN IT COMES TO
POLICY ISSUES LIKE THE POLICY,
THE BORDER, OR ABORTION?
>> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BIG
ONES HERE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG ONES
THAT WILL DRIVE PEOPLE TO THE
POLLS IN NOVEMBER, THE ECONOMY
AND INFLATION.
CHAIR POWELL SAID THEY ARE NOT
CUTTING INTEREST RATES BUT
SUGGESTING RATE CUTS COULD COME
POSSIBLY IN SEPTEMBER. SUPER
INTERESTING DYNAMIC FROM A
POLICY PERSPECTIVE GIVEN THAT
IS IN THE FALL OF THE
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN YEAR.
HOW THE ECONOMY MOVES,
DEMOCRATS OBVIOUSLY HOPING
THINGS IMPROVE AND INFLATION
CONTINUES TO GO DOWN. THAT
WOULD BE A BOOST TO THEM
POTENTIALLY BUT YOU'VE GOT THE
FORMER PRESIDENT CONTINUING TO
HAMMER WHAT THEY SEE AS THE
BIDEN/HARRIS. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
CONTINUING TO LEAN INTO THE
BORDER AM I CALLING KAMALA
HARRIS AS THE ONE TASKED WITH
LEADING THE WHITE HOUSE AND
ADMINISTRATION ON IMMIGRATION
ISSUES.
BIT OF A DIFFERENT TONE FROM
KAMALA HARRIS AFTER RALLY
YESTERDAY IN GEORGIA TAKING
THAT HEAD-ON AND FLIPPING THE
SCRIPT TO A DEGREE, AS DID MARK
KELLY, SUGGESTING IT IS, IN
FACT, DONALD TRUMP WHO KILLED A
PLAN, A BILL IN CONGRESS THAT
COULD HAVE SOLVED THESE BORDER
ISSUES I THINK YOU'RE SEEING A
CLASH ON THAT TOPI
