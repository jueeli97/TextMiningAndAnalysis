IN CONGRESS. AND BIDEN'S RUNNING MATE I LOOKING FOR A VP OF HER OWN AN ONE IS ABOUT TO RALLY FOR HARRIS

THE PRESIDENT TO LAY OUT ANY MINUTE HERE IN A SPEECH THAT W WILL BRING YOU LIVE. >> Reporter: YES
REMEMBER THIS IS A HUGE SHIF FOR BIDEN WHO LONG RESISTE CALLS TO OVERHAUL THE SUPREM
COURT. WE EXPECT HIM TO TALK ABOUT TH PROPOSALS HE MADE IN THE OP-ED THIS MORNING WHERE HE CALLED FOR
AMONG OTHER THINGS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, MAKING IT FORMER PRESIDENTS TO NOT HAVE
IMMUNITY FROM CRIMES THE COMMITTED WHILE IPOFFICE AND ALSO CALLING FOR AN 18 YEAR TERM
LIMIT FOR JUSTICES THEY HAVE A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT NOW. AND CALLING FOR A CODE O
CONDUCT FOR THE JUSTICES, ALL IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE SUPREME COURT IN RECENT MONTHS WHERE WE HAVE
SEEN SOME OF THESE CONSERVATIV JUSTICES DISCLOSE GIFTS AN SUCH SO THE PRESIDENT IS WELL AWARE
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD. WE HEARD SPEAKER JOHNSON SAY THAT THIS WOULD BE DEAD ON
ARRIVAL IN THE CONSERVATIV MAJORITY HOUSE . OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT TO GE THIS DONE, IT WOULD REQUIR
CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL THE PRESIDENT LANDING IN AUSTI IN THE LAST HOUR, REACTING T
THAT COMMENT FROM SPEAKE JOHNSON. LISTEN HERE. >> MR. PRESIDENT, HAS SPEAKE JOHNSON SAID YOUR SUPREME COUR
REFORM IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL? WHAT IS YOUR REACTION SIR? SPEAKER JOHNSON SAID IT IS DEA
ON ARRIVAL >> I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE SAID HE IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL.
>> HOW WILL YOU GET THIS DONE? >> WE'RE GOING TO FIND A WAY

REMAINING TIME IN OFFICE BUT DIFFICULT AS HE IS A LAME DUCK PRESIDENT. >> ALLIE RAFFA, I'M GOING TO ASK

BEGINS LET'S BRING IN DASHA BURNS MICHIGAN'S GOVERNOR IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU AS SHE AND TH PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR ARE OUT AT
A RALLY FOR HARRIS THE VICE PRESIDENT IS NOT THER BUT THESE TWO, ONE OF THEM A LEADING CONTENDER TO BE HE
RUNNING MATE >> Reporter: I WILL USE MY VOICE BECAUSE I HAVE A GOVERNO
SPEAKING BEHIND ME JOSH SHAPIRO IS A LEADIN CONTENDER FOR MANY REASONS, ON
PEAG THE STATE HE IS FROM, PENNSYLVANIA IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. HE IS ALSO SOMEONE WHO HAS BEE
KNOWN AND BRANDED HIMSELF AS A BIPARTISAN GOVERNOR. HE IS SOMEONE WHO CAN BRIN
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICAN TOGETHER HARRIS IS LOOKING FOR A MORE MODERATE ON HER TICKET, SOMEON WHO CAN APPEAL TO THE SWIN
VOTERS SHAPIRO COULD HAVE A SERIOUS LEG UP HERE.
HE COMES FROM A STATE WHER ENERGY IS IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL TO THE ECONOMY THERE IS A LONG LIST RIGHT NOW
AND NOT A LOT OF TIME TO MAK THE DECISION OUR REPORTING SAYS SHE HAS T
MAKE THE PUSH BY AUGUST 7t WHICH IS COMING RIGHT UP >> THE DNC SAID THAT IS THEI
DEADLINE MULTIPLE SOURCES CLOSE TO TH CAMPAIGN TELL OUR TEAM THEY WANT TO GET IT DONE NEXT WEDNESDAY.
WE ARE LOOKING AT A CRUCIA WEEK I'M WONDERING IF WHITMER O SHAPIRO WILL LEAN INTO THE
MESSAGING THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM DEMOCRATS OVER THE LAST DAY OR TWO WHICH IS THE IDEA, A FA
CRY FROM MAYBE THE MICHELL OBAMA, WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH, AND INSTEAD, CALLING THE
REPUBLICAN TICKET WEIRD OR CREEPY THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES. HAVE YOU HEARD THAT TODAY?
TALK US THROUGH THE MESSAGING. >> Reporter: I KEEP LISTENIN FOR THE WORD WEIRD BUT IT HASN'T
COME UP YET IN WHITMER'S SPEECH. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DRA THE CONTRAST AND USING WORDS
THAT ARE LIKE THE MEMEIFICATIO OF DEMOCRATIC RHETORIC WHEN IT COMES TO ATTACKS AGAINST REPUBLICANS AND MAYBE JUST LIK
A YOUNGER ENERGY COMING FROM THE
YOUNGER CANDIDATE AND TH YOUNGER CANDIDATE OF HER RUNNING MATE AS WELL YOU CAN SEE IT SHIFT TO A VIBE
THAT MAYBE APPEALS MORE TO MILLENNIAL AND GEN Z VOTERS. A LOT OF TALK NOW FROM GRETCHE
WHITMER ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN WILL LEA INTO HEAVILY IN THE COMING
MONTHS >> BEFORE I LET YOU GO, THER ARE CRITICISMS AGAINST JD VANC FOR THE COMMENTS HE MADE IN 2021
ABOUT QUOTE UNQUOTE CHILDLES CAT LADIES ARE RUNNING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY VANCE SAYING IN THE LAST FEW
HOURS THAT IT WAS TAGEN OUT OF CONTEXT AND BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION
HE SAYS HE HAS NOTHING AGAINST CATS >> Reporter: OR DOGS, HE SAYS. BUT LOOK, IT IS AMAZING HOW MUCH
THE TABLES HAVE TURNED YOU AND I WERE AT THE RN RECENTLY WHERE WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS SO UNIFIED AND HOW DEMOCRATS WERE FRACTURED AND TRYING TO FIND A WAY FORWARD AND NOW THE
WORLD IS UPSIDE DOWN AGAIN I THE ELECTION CYCLE WHERE YOU
HAVE A LOT OF CRITICISM OF VANCE AND HAVING TO DO CLEANUP AND DEMOCRATS, I'M AT THE RALL
AND HARRIS IS NOT EVEN HERE. THERE ARE 1,000 PEOPLE HERE AN A TON OF ENTHUSIASM.
NOW THE STAKES ARE ON TH DEMOCRATIC SIDE. A LOT OF CHANGES BUT THERE I MOMENTUM ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
AISLE RIGHT NOW AND A LITTLE BIT OF A COMPLICATED AND LITTLE BI OF A CONTROVERSY WITH THE NE
RUNNING MATE FOR FORME PRESIDENT TRUMP. >> LET'S LISTEN IN FOR A HALF
SECOND >> MY GRANDMA SAID I NEEDED TO FIND ONE GOOD THING ABOUT EVER PERSON
SO I'LL GIVE JD THIS HE IS EFFICIENT. IN ONE SENTENCE, HE INSULTED
WOMEN, BLACK PEOPLE, AND JEWIS PEOPLE THAT'S EFFICIENT AND THAT'S AL
I GOT. >> YOU SEE THERE GRETCHE WHITMER ALONG SIDE PENNSYLVANI
GOVERNOR JAGS SHAPIRO. GOVERNOR WHITMER ESSENTIALLY PULLED HERSELF OUT OF THE VI
GIG SAYING SHE WANTS TO REMAIN GOVERNOR AND HELP THE CAMPAIGN DASHA, STAND BY AND WE MAY COM
BACK TO YOU. I WANT TO GET TO KEN DILANIA WHO IS JOINING US WITH NEW DETAILS ON THE ATTEMPTED
ASSASSINATION OF DONALD TRUMP. THE FBI IS NOW REVEALING THA THE PRESIDENT HAS AGREED TO GIVE
A VICTIM INTERVIEW AS WE HAVE THE NEW INFORMATION FROM THE FBI, WE ARE GETTING A LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM
LOCAL OFFICERS, S.W.A.T. OFFICERS ON THE GROUND I PENNSYLVANIA WHO ARE SAYIN TODAY, WAIT A SECOND, WE HAV
TEXT MESSAGES THAT SHOW WE SAW THIS GUNMAN HOURS BEFORE THE SHOOTING ACTUALLY HAPPENED AND
NEVER HAD CONTACT WITH THE SECRET SERVICE LET ME PLAY THAT IN A CLIP HERE.
>> WE LEARNED THE SUBJECT WA HIGHLY INTELLIGENT, ATTENDED
COLLEGE AND MAINTAINED STEAD EMPLOYMENT HIS PRIMARY SOCIAL SURGLES APPEAR TO BE LIMITED TO HI
IMMEDIATE FAMILY AS WE BELIEVE HE HAD FEW FRIENDS AND
ACQUAINTANCES THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED OUR SUBJECT'S INTEREST IN SHOOTING BEGAN AS
HOBBY AND REQUESTS PROGRESSE INTO FORMER FIREARMS TRAINING,
PARTICULARLY SINCE SEPTEMBER O 2023 >> THAT WAS NOT THE LOCA OFFICERS BUT THAT WAS THE FB TALKING ABOUT THE GUNMAN HERE IN
THIS CASE. >> THERE ARE TWO TRACKS HERE THE SECRET SERVICE FAILURE THA YOU WERE ALLUDING TO
THE FBI BRIEFING WAS ONLY ABOU THE INVESTIGATION AND THEY WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES OF THE
SECRET SERVICE OFFICIALS SAID THEY CONDUCTE 450 INTERVIEWS, SENT SUBPOENAS TO 86 TECH COMPANIES TO GET AL
OF THE ACCOUNTS AND THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE A PICTURE OF HIS MOTIVE THEY DO HAVE MORE DETAILS ON
WHAT KIND OF A PERSON HE WAS THEY CALLED HIM AN INTELLIGENT
LONER. HE GOOGLED AN INCIDENT WHEN TH
PRIME MINISTER OF SLOVAKIA WAS THE VICTIM OF AN ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPT. THEY ALSO REVEALED THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS REVEALED TO DO A
VICTIM'S INTERVIEW THEY WANT THE VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS THE SAME FBI THAT IS TRYING TO PUT TRUMP IN PRISO
FOR SEPARATE CRIMINAL CASES AN NOWTHEY WILL INTERVIEW HIM AS VICTIM OF CRIME. >> AND THE SECRET SERVIC
DIRECTOR HAS ALREADY RESIGNED. THERE IS ANOTHER HEARING TOMORROW ON THE SENATE SIDE. >> WITH THE ACTING SECRE

SPEAKING IN AUSTIN, TEXA REGARDING JUDICIAL REFORM ON THE SUPREME COURT. WE WILL TAKE YOU THERE NOW
THIS IS PRESIDENT BIDEN SPEAKING IN AUSTIN, TEXAS LET'S LISTEN IN FOR A COUPLE O
MINUTES. >> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU, REALLY, THANK YOU PLEASE, PLEASE
THANK YOU MR. AMBASSADOR THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND ABOVE ALL YOUR FRIENDSHI
OVER THE YEARS THERE IS ONLY ONE WORD THA COMES TO MIND WHEN I THINK O
ANDY YOUNG, INTEGRITY, ABSOLUT INTEGRITY. THANK YOU TO THE JOHNSON FAMIL FOR CARRYING ON THE SUPPORTERS
OF THE PRECEDENCY. YOUR IS INCREDIBLE AS WELL THE SAME GOES TO THE PRESIDENT
OF THE FOUNDATION, GREAT TO BE BACK HERE AND I THANK YOU ALL,
GUESTS GATHERED HERE TODAY LOOK, I WAS IN COLLEGE AT TH UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE IN MY
EARLY YEARS WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY HA
BEEN ASSASSINATED. I REMEMBER EXACTLY LIKE EVERYONE IN MY GENERATION WHERE THEY WERE SITTING, STANDING, OR WALKING.
I WAS ON THE STEPS OF ONE OF THE
HALLS OF THE UNIVERSITY CALLED COLLEEN HALL, LISTENING ON A
RADIO WITH THREE OTHER PEOPLE. IT SEEMED UNBELIEVABLE AND THEN LATER WATCHIN
PRESIDENT JOHNSON HELP THE NATION FIND A WAY FORWARD. IN HIS FIRST ADDRESS AFTER THE
TRAGEDY, PRESIDENT JOHNSON SAI AND I QUOTE, NOTHING COULD MOR
ELOQUENTLY HONOR PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S MEMORY THAN TH EARLIEST PASSAGE OF THE CIVI
RIGHTS BILL. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. AND AS A KID COMING UP, I ALWAYS
ADMIRED PRESIDENT JOHNSON FO HIS PUBLIC SERVICE, SCHOOL
TEACHER IN SOUTH TEXAS, MASTER OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE,
HISTORIC VICE PRESIDENT AN PRESIDENT. AND IN THE GREAT SOCIETY, TH GREAT SOCIETY, NO ONE, NO ON
SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND. HE SAID IT IS TIME TO SEE THAT
EVERY AMERICAN GETS A DECENT BREAK AND A FAIR CHANCE TO MAK
GOOD AND THEN YOUNG SAID TO PRESIDENT JOHNSON, TO BUILD A COALITION TO
BRING THE VISION TO LIFE HE DID HE BROUGHT IT TO LIFE.
WELL 50 YEARS AND THE LB FOUNDATION HAS CONVENED TH SYMPOSIUM TO REFLECT ONE OF TH
CROWNING ACHIEVEMENTS, THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964, A DEFINING
MOMENT THAT HAS OPENED DOORS FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AMERICAN REGARDLESS OF RACE, SEXUAL
ORIENTATION, GENDER, RELIGION, NATIONAL ORIGIN. TOGETHER WITH THE VOTING RIGHT ACT AND THE FAIR HOUSING ACT
THESE THREE MEN MARKED LAWS THAT ARE REMARKABLE IN THEIR SCAL
AND SCOPE. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE THREE ACTS HAVE MADE THE NATION FUNDAMENTALLY MORE FAIR, MOR
JUST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY FUNDAMENTALLY MORE CONSISTEN WITH OUR FOUNDING PRINCIPLES
FOR REAL, FOR REAL AND WE ARE A BETTER NATION
BECAUSE OF THEM. WE MUST BE CLEAR THEIR WORK, OUR WORK IS NO
DONE IT'S NOT DONE. WE DO NOT CELEBRATE THESE LAWS AS PART OF OUR PAST BUT AS
CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF OUR FUTURE PRESIDENT JOHNSON UNDERSTOOD AND PRESIDENT LIKEN UNDERSTOOD I
HIS OWN TIME THAT THE COURTS WOULD DAERL THE SCALE AND SKOA
OF OUR LAWS. BUT 100 YEARS AFTER TH
EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, PRESIDENT JOHNSON VOWED IN HIS WORDS TO DO THIS JOB THA LINCOLN STARTED, TO DO THIS JO
THAT LINCOLN STARTED B CHALLENGING THE COURT TO LIVE UP TO ITS CONSTITUTIONA
RESPONSIBILITY HE DID THAT BY NOMINATIN THURGOOD MARSHALL AND THE FIRS
BLACK JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. AND BY AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDIN
CIVIL RIGHTS THROUGHOUT TH COURTS BUT NOW, WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT
ERA. IN RECENT YEARS, EXTREME OPINIONS THAT THE SUPREME COUR HAS HANDED DOWN HAVE UNDERMINE
LONG ESTABLISHED CIVIL RIGHT PRINCIPLES OF PROTECTION IN 2013, THE SUPREME COURT I SHELBY COUNTY CASE GUTTED TH
VOTING RIGHTS ACT. OPENING THE FLOD GATES FOR
MILLIONS OF RESTRICTING VOTING LAWS THAT HAVE SEEN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY PASS.
IN 2022, THE COURT OVERTURNE ROE V. WADE, AND THE RIGHT T CHOOSE WHICH HAD BEEN THE LAW OF
THE LAND FOR 50 YEARS, 50 YEARS. THE FOLLOWING YEAR, THE SAME
COURT EVISCERATED AFFIRMATIV ACTION WHICH HAD BEEN UPHELD FOR
NEARLY 50 YEARS AS WELL. NOW AN EXTREME MOVEMENT AN
AGENDA CALLED PROJECT 2025, BY THE WAY, THEY ARE SERIOUS MAN,
THEY ARE PLANNING ANOTHE ONSLAUGHT OF ATTACK ON CIVIL
RIGHTS IN AMERICA. FOR EXAMPLE, PROJECT 2025 CALL FOR ATTACKING DIVERSITY, EQUIT AND INCLUSION ACROSS ALL ASPECTS
OF AMERICAN LIFE THIS EXTREME MAGA MOVEMENT I SUPPOSED TO END BIRTH RATE
CITIZENSHIP, WHICH IS IF YOU ARE BORN IN AMERICA, YOU ARE A
AMERICAN CITIZEN THAT'S HOW XROEM THEY ARE.
THE RIGHTS ARE LIKELY TO COM BEFORE THE COURT IN YEARS TO COME AND MOST RECENTLY AN
SHOCKINGLY, THE SUPREME COUR ESTABLISHED IN TRUMP VERSU UNITED STATES A DANGEROU
PRECEDENT. THEY RULED AS YOU KNOW THAT TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
HAS IMMUNITY FOR POTENTIAL CRIMES HE MAY HAVE COMMITTED
WHILE IN OFFICE, IMMUNITY. THIS NATION WAS FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THERE ARE N
KINGS IN AMERICA EACH OF US ARE EQUAL BEFORE TH
LAW. NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW AND FO PRACTICAL PURPOSES, THE COURT' DECISION ALMOST CERTAINLY MEAN
THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN VIOLATE THEIR OATH, FLOUT OUR LAWS AND
FACE NO CONSEQUENCES AND JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR IN A
DISSENT SAYS THAT THE PRESIDEN WILL BE INSULATED FROM
PROSECUTION IF HE SEEKS TO ASSASSIN A POLITICAL RIVALRY IMMUNE, ORGANIZES A MILITARY
COUP TO HOLD ONTO POWERER, IMMUNE, TAKES A BRIBE FROM FOREIGN POWER, IMMUNE, EVERY USE
OF OFFICIAL POWER, THE PRESIDENT IS NOW A KING ABOVE THE LAW.
THAT IS WHAT JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR WROTE IN THE DISSENT
FOLKS, JUST IMAGINE WHAT A PRESIDENT COULD DO TRAMPLE CIVIL
RIGHTS AND IMMUNITIES GIVEN SUCH IMMUNITY THIS DECISION IS A TOTAL AFRON TO THE BASIC EXPECTATIONS WE
HAVE FOR THOSE WHO WIELD THE POWER IN THIS NATION
BUT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO B WHOLLY ACCOUNTABLE UNDER THE
LAW. THE PRESIDENT IS NO LONGER CONSTRAINED BY THE LAW AND ONL LIMITS ON ABUSE OF POWER WILL BE
SELF IMPOSED BY THE PRESIDEN ALONE. THAT IS A FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED
PRINCIPLE, A DANGEROUS PRINCIPLE, ON TOP OF THE EXTREME
DECISION MIRED IN THE CRISIS O ETHINGS. THESE SCANDALS INVOLVING THE
JUSTICES HAVE CAUSED PUBLI OPINION TO QUESTION THE COURT'
FAIRNESS AND INDEPENDENCE. IT DEFEATS CARRYING OUT TH MISSION OF EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER
THE LAW. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE DOCUMENTED REPORTS OF DECADE LONG EFFORTS TO RESHAPE TH
JUDICIARY, INCLUDING A SUPREME COURT BACKED BY SHADOW SPECIAL INTEREST THAT WOULD ALSO SUPPORT
PROJECT 2025 GIFTS TO JUSTICES WORTH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO WEALTHY BENEFACTORS WHO HAVE
INTEREST BEFORE THE COURT THEY CONTRIBUTED TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST FROM THOSE
CONNECTED WITH JANUARY 6th INSURRECTIONISTS AND A BLATANT ATTACK ON NOMINATING CONFIRMIN
JUSTICES TO THE COURT ITSELF DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN JUSTICE
SCALISE DIED IN 2015 THE REPUBLICANS FOUGHT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S NOMINATION TO FILL THE VACACY FOR NEARLY A YEAR B
MAKING UP AN ENTIRELY NE STANDARD THAT THERE BE N CONFORMATIONS OF THE COURT
DURING ELECTION YEARS. BUT THEN, BECAUSE GINSBURG DIE
IN 2020, REPUBLICANS RUSHED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NOMINEE AT THE SAME TIME VOTES WERE BEING CAS
IPAN ELECTION THAT TRUMP WOULD
LOSE IT'S OUTRAGEOUS. I KNOW I DON'T LOOK IT BUT I SAT IN THE SENATE FOR 36 YEARS
INCLUDING AS CHAIRMAN AN RANKING MEMBER OF THE JUDICIAR COMMITTEE. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT I HAVE
OVERSEEN MORE SUPREME COUR NOMINATIONS AS SENATOR, VICE PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT THAN
ANYONE ALIVE TODAY I HAVE GREAT RESPECT T FOR THE
INSTITUTION AND THE SEPARATION OF POWER LAID OUT IN THE CONSTITUTION WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IS NOT
CONSISTENT WITH THAT DOCTRINE OF SEPARATION OF POWER.
IT IS EXTREMISM, UNDERMINING THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE COURT'S DECISION AS SOON AS I CONVENE A
BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON THE SUPREME COURT, COMPRISED WIT
LEADING SCHOLARS, BOTH LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVES, PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COURT
I HAVE BEEN CAREFUL OF THESE DELIBERATIONS. THESE ARE SERIOUS, SERIOUS DECISIONS. IN THE CASE OF INCREASIN
THREATS TO DEMOCRATI INSTITUTIONS, I USED COMMISSIO ANALYSIS AND TODAY I'M CALLING FOR THREE BOLD REFORMS T
RESTORE TRUST AND ACCOUNTABILITY
TO THE COURT AND OUR DEMOCRACY THE REPUBLICAN SPEAKER OF TH
HOUSE SAID IT WAS DEAD O ARRIVAL. WELL, HIS SPEAKING IS DEAD O
ARRIVAL. FIRST, CALLING FOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT CALLE NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LA
AMENDMENT. I MEAN IT SINCERELY, NO IMMUNITY
FOR CRIMES A FORMER PRESIDEN
COMMITTED WHILE IN OFFICE. I SHARE OUR FOUNDER'S BELIEF THAT THE PRESIDENT MUST ANSWER
TO THE LAW BECAUSE HE IS ACCOUNTABLE TO EXERCISE TH GREAT POWER OF PRESIDENCY.
WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS, NOT
KINGS AND DICTATORS. IT CAN BE BOILED DOWN TO ONE
CASE, TRUMP VERSUS THE UNITE STATES THE COURT ASSERTED THAT HE WAS MAKING A RULING FOR THE AGES
THAT ISN'T TRUE. THE COURT MADE A RULING FOR ONE, A FORMER PRESIDENT
NO OTHER PRESIDENT IN OU HISTORY IS AFTER THIS KIND O IMMUNITY FOR CRIMINAL ACTIONS.
NO PRESIDENT, NO FORME PRESIDENT, NOT ME, NOT ONE, NO
ONE HAS BEEN GIVEN ANY EXCEPTION
WITH SUCH ENEMY. THE SECOND THING THYME ASKING, WE HAVE HAD TERM LIMITS FO
PRESIDENTS AND I BELIEVE W SHOULD HAVE TERM LIMITS FOR TH
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AS WELL THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONL
MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY THAT GIVES LIFETIME SEATS TO THEIR HIGH COURT
TERM LIMITS WILL ASSURE TH COURT MEMBERSHIP CHANGES WIT
SOME REGULATOR THAT WOULD BE TIMING FOR THE COURT'S NOMINATION MOR
PREDICTABLE AND LESS ARBITRARY AND REDUCE THE CHANCE THAT ANY
SINGLE PRESIDENT IMPOSES O INFLUENCINGING GENERATIONS T COME
A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION
CONVENED ANALYZED VARIOU STRUCTURES I BELIEVE THE BEST STRUCTURE I 18 YEAR TERM LIMIT
THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT THE COUNTRY DOES NOT HAVE WHAT I HAS NOW, AN EXTREME COURT THAT IS PROUD OF AN ATTACK ON A
CONFIRMATION PROCESS THAT IS WEAPONIZED BY THOSE SEEKING TO CARRY OUT AN EXTREME AGENDA FO
DECADES TO COME. BY THE WAY, THESE GUYS MEAN IT THESE GUYS MEAN IT
PROJECT 2025 IS REAL THEY MEAN IT
THIRD,IME CALLING FOR A BINDIN CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE SUPREM
COURT.
THE SUPREME COURT'S CODE IS WEAK AND IT IS VOLUNTARY. ANY CODE OF CONGRESS MUST BE
ENFORCEABLE. THE REFORM I PROPOSED, JUSTICE WILL BE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE GIFTS, REFRAIN FROM PUBLIC
POLITICAL ACTIVITY RECUSE THEMSELVES IN CASES I WHICH THEIR SPOUSES HAVE A
FINANCIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT CONGRESS PASSED A LAW DECADE
AGO THAT SAYS ALL FEDERA JUDGES, INCLUDING SUPREME COUR JUSTICES HAVE TO RECUS
THEMSELVES IN SUCH CASES BUT THE CURRENT JUSTICES INSIS
OF PUSHING THE REQUIREMENT
THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY PUBLI OVER SIGHT AND THAT IS THEIR DECISION AND THEY DON'T NEED TO TELL US HOW
THEY MADE IT THE COURT IS NOT SELF POLICING A COURT IS NOT DEALING WITH TH
OBVIOUS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. WE NEED A MANDATORY CODE O ETHICS FOR THE SUPREME COURT AND
WE NEED IT NOW
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, BASED O ALL MY EXPERIENCE, I'M CERTAIN
WE NEED THE REFORMS TO TRUST I THE COURT AND PRESERVE THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCE
THAT ARE VITAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY.
ALSO COMMON SENSE REFORMS AN WITH THE SUPPORT OF LA
SCHOLARS, PROGRESSIVES AND CONSERVATIVES. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORK WIT CONGRESS ON THESE REFORMS. THERE ARE MEMBERS OF CONGRES
HERE TODAY LET ME CLOSE WITH THIS PRESIDENT JOHNSON SIGNED THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 JUS
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FOURTH O JULY HE SAID IN THAT BILL SIGNING AND
I QUOTE, THIS IS A PROUD TRIUMPH. IF THOSE WHO FOUNDED OUR COUNTRY
XU THAT FREEDOM WOULD BE SECURED ONLY IF EACH GENERATION FOUGHT
TO RENEW AND ENLARGE ITS MEETING, END OF QUOTE, THAT'
WHAT I TRIED TO DO OF THROUGHOUT
THE CAREER
THAT'S WHAT GOT ME INVOLVE INITIALLY. MY STATE WAS THE STATE THAT WA
SEGREGATED BY LAW WE WER
FIGHTING KW COULDN'T GET THERE I'M SERIOUS. WHAT MOTIVATED ME TO BE A PUBLIC
DEFENDER, COUNTY COUNSELOR, WILL NEVER FORGET, I HAD A GOO JOB WITH A BIG TRIAL FIRM IN
DELAWARE YOU HAVE TO SIT FOR THE BAR FO SIGS MONTHS BEFORE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE IT AND IN THE MEANTIME I WA
STUDYING FOR THE BAR, THAT'S
WHEN DR. KING WAS ASSASSINATED THERE WAS MILITARY STATIONED O
EVERY CORNER FOR TEN MONTHS, TEN MONTHS WE HAD A VERY CONSERVATIVE
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR AND TH DEMOCRATS WANTED TO CHOOSE TO BE A PART OF THE NORTHERN O
SOUTHERN GOVERNORS CONFERENCE. AND GUESS WHAT GOT ME INGAMGED. I LOVE READING THE BIOGRAPHIES
OF ME NOW KNOWING I WAS GOING TO
RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I REMEMBER WALKING IN TO THE
PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE, AN ASKING FOR AN APPLICATION TO B
A PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND SAID DON'TIA WORK FOR THE LAW FIR
SANDERS? AND I SAID YEAH. WHY THE HELL DO YOU WANT TO DO
THIS NOT A JOKE I SAID LET ME DO IT.
I BECAME A PUBLIC DEFENDER HERE'S THE DEAL. I GOT ENGAGED LIKE A LOT OF YO DO, WHETHER YOU RUN FOR OFFICE
OR NOT YOU GET ENGAGED AND YOU WANT T CHANGE THINGS. I KEPT TRYING TO CHANGE TH
DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH WAS VER MUCH CONSERVATIVE. AND THEN THE NEXT GROUP OF
PEOPLE CAME TO ME, SENATOR CHRIS COOPS SAID WE WANT YOU TO RU FOR STATE SENATE AND I SAID
CAN'T. I'M JUST STARTING A LAW FIRM AND I'M A PART-TIME PUBLIC DEFENDER. AND THEN THEY COME BACK AND SAID
I WANT YOU TO RUN FOR COUNTY
COUNCIL. AND THEY SAID ARE YOU STUPID I SAID IT IS RIGHT ACROSS TH
STREET THERE I'M SERIOUS. SO MY SISTER AND MY BEST FRIEN WHO MANAGED MY CAMPAIGN AND WE
TICK PICKED A DISTRICT WE COUL NOT WIN. BUT MY PROBLEM WAS I HAD M
SISTER DOING MY CAMPAIGN AND WE WON NEXT THING I KNOW I WAS PART O
A GROUP ASSIGNED TO YOUN SENATORS, ELECTED OFFICIALS TO TRY TO BRING THE PARTY AROUN
AND GET SOME IN THE SENATE AND I WAS PUT ON A COMMISSION. AND SO I REMEMBER GOING DOWN T
THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENGZTION AN
AFTER THE AFTERNOON SESSION, W WERE IN THE ROOM IT IS NICE TO GET OUT AND TH
MILITARY IS OPENING YOUR DOOR. 8 BY 10 BATHROOM WITH A SHOWER AND STALL AND I HAD MY TOWEL
AROUND ME WITH MY SHAVING CREA AND BAM, BAM, BAM ON MY DOOR AND I THOUGHT IT WAS THE GUY I
CAME DOWN WITH, HE HAD A TAL SHOW, BOB CUNNINGHAM, A BI
CIVIL RIGHTS GUY I WALKED TO THE DOOR AND IT WA THE FORMER GOVERNOR, FORME
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, SWEAR T GOD, THE STATE CHAIRMAN AND TH
FORMER CONGRESSMAN I SAID I JUST HAD DINNER, I'
SORRY GENTLEMEN. AND I WALKED IN AND RAN IN THE BATHROOM AND HAD TO PU
SOMETHING ON AND I WALKED BACK OUT IN A TOWEL AND WAS STANDING AGAINST A DES
NAIL OF A WALL AND ON THE BEDS THAT WERE THE NAILED TO TH
WALL AND FOUR OF US ACROSS. JOE, WE WERE THINKING, YOU SHOULD RUN FOR UNITED STATES
SENATE AND I SAID ARE YOU CRAZY -- AR YOU SERIOUS? AND THEY WENT ON AND MAED THEI
CASE I HOPE ALL OF YOU. >> YOU HAVE BEEN LISTENING TOPRESIDENT BIDEN LIVE IN TEXAS. HE IS NOW RIFFING ABOUT HI
START IN POLITICS. BUT BEFORE THAT, LAYING OUT HI ARGUMENT AND HIS CASE FOR TH
SUPREME COURT OVERHAUL THA INCLUDES A FEW THINGS, JUDICIA REFORM, CASTING ALONG THE LINE
OF HISTORY, SUGGESTING THERE SHOULD BE NO IMMUNITY FO PRESIDENTS, TERM LIMITS FO SUPREME COURT JUSTICES AND A CODE OF CONDUCT AS WELL.
I WANT TO BRING IN MIKE MEMOLI WHO HAS BEEN LISTENING WITH US
THIS IS SOMETHING THE PRESIDEN PLEDGED TO DO. SOMETHING YOU HEARD HIM NOD TO
EARLIER ON >> HE TOOK ON DIRECTLY THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FOR SAYIN THIS IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL AND HE
SAID YOUR IDEAS ARE DEAD O ARRIVAL. THIS IS AN INTERESTING WINDO
INTO HOW THE PRESIDENT WENT INTO HIS TIME IN OFFICE HE STARTED HIS CAREER BECAUSE OF
THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT WHICH W ARE MARKING HERE AND NOW HE IS IN THE MOMENT,
BURDENED BY THE CAMPAIGN AND H WANTS TO PUT THE BIG ISSUE
FRONT CENTER BEFORE THE NO
VOTERS NOW HE CAN MAKE THE CASE FOR DEMOCRACY. HE LAID OUT THE WAY IN WHICH H THINKS THE SUPREME COURT HAS
GONE ASTRAY AND THE DECISION THEY HAVE MADE AND THE ETHICAL CODE OF CONDUCT TO GO INTO THA
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS S STRIKING THE PRESIDENT BOTH IN LAYING OUT AN IMPORTANT ARGUMENT FOR TH
PEOPLE TO CONSIDER AS THEY CONSIDER THE FUTURE OF THI COUNTRY IN NOVEMBER BUT ALSO HIS
LEGACY, YOU SAW ALL OF THAT EVEN AS THE PRESIDENT WENT OFF TH PROMPTTER AS HE WAS SUPPOSED T
BE CONCLUDING ABOUT HIS START IN POLITICS AS HE IS NEAR THE END >> THANK YOU WE ARE WATCHING PRESIDENT BIDE
IN TEXAS ONE OF OUR HEADLINES TONIGHT BUT NOT THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER ONES TO GET TO INCLUDING OUT WEST
WHERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES
WITH THE BIGGEST WILDFIR BURNING, ONLY 12% CONTAINED. LOOK AT THE STUNNING IMAGES OF
THE CITY THAT IS UNRECOGNIZABL THERE. ALL IN ALL 360,000 CAKEERS HAV BURNED, MORE THAN 100 BUILDING
DESTROYED AND SO MANY MORE A RISK FLAMES FROM THE PARK FIRE NO
REACHING FARMING TOWNS NORTH O CHICO. IT IS WINDY AND THREATENING TO SPREAD THE FIRE MORE IT IS NEXT TO THE CITY O
PARADISE WHICH WAS DEVASTATED BY THE CAMP FIRE IN 2018. SOME PEOPLE HAVING TO EVACUATE FOR THE SEG TIME IN JUST SIX
YEARS. >> I WAS READY TO GO TO BED AN I HEAR A POUNDING ON THE DOO AND I OPEN IT UP AND HE GOES
FIRE DEPARTMENT, GET YOUR STUFF, YOU'RE LEAVING
AND I SAID NO, NOT AGAIN NOT AGAIN. I LOVE PARADISE. I'M HOPING IT IS STILL THERE
WHEN I GET BACK. >> ABOUT AN HOUR FROM NOW, THE MAN SUSPECTED OF STARTING TH FIRE ON PURPOSE WILL FACE
JUDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME STEVE PATTERSON IS JOINING U NOW. TALK US THROUGH WHAT YOU ARE
SEEING ON THE GROUND THE IMAGES ARE DEVASTATING >> Reporter: IT IS JUS DESTRUCTION WHERE THE FIRE SWEPT
THROUGH AND HIT. THERE ARE A DOZEN OR SO HOME AND STRUCTURES DESTROYED
THE FIRE IS SO HUGE. WE ARE JUST IN ONE TINY POCKET
OF IT, ONE QUADRANT THAT IS TH SIZE OF A LARGE AMERICAN CIT
BURNING ON ALL FRONTS. FIREFIGHTERS HAVE HAD SUCCES OVER IT THE LAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS AND TEMPERATURES COOLED
DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY IT WAS A LOT COOLER. THE REASON WHY THERE IS AN CONTAINMENT ON THIS FIRE IS FO
THAT REASON ALONE. SPEAKING TO SMF O TH FIREFIGHTERS, THEY WERE ABLE T
MAKE SOME PROGRESS 12% CONTAINMENT ON 360,000 ACR FIRE IS SIGNIFICANT, SMALL BUT
SIGNIFICANT. THE FIRE CONTINUES TO GROW AND ANY TIME THIS IS HOT, BONE DRY
FUEL EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTY, INCREDIBLY FIRE PRONE WHIC ALLOWS IT TO TAKE OFF IN A
DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THE FRONT OF THE FIRE IS NOT JUST ONE PLACE ANY TIME THE WIND BLOWS,
ESSENTIALLY FIREFIGHTERS ARE DEALING WITH A NEW EDGE OF THE FIRE
WHAT IS LEFT IN ITS WAY IS DESTRUCTION. WHERE I'M STANDING, YOU MEPGZE
PARADISE AND THE FIRE THERE. THE PERSON THAT WE ARE ABLE TO
STAND ON THEIR PROPERTY, THIS IS THEIR SECOND HOME. THEIR FIRST HOME BURNED DOWN I THE FIRE IN PARADISE SIX YEARS
AGO AND THEN THIS FIRE BURNE DOWN THEY TRIED TO SAVE AS MUCH ARTIFACTS FROM THE FIRST HOM AND THE SECOND HOME BURNED A
WELL AND THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TRAUMATIZED BY THE CONTINUED FIRES BURNING IN THE CLIMATE
CHANGE ERA OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT HAVE SUPERCHARGED THE FIRES. >> I THINK SOME PEOPLE MAY HEA
THAT STORY AND THEY FIND IT SO DIFFICULT TO BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEONE MAY HAVE SET IT ON
PURPOSE BUT THAT IS TH ACCUSATION HERE. TALK ABOUT THE SUSPECT AND THE
COURT PROCEEDINGS. ANY ACCOUNTABILITY MOVIN FORWARD HERE >> Reporter: 42-YEAR-OLD RONNI SCOUT JR. HELD ON SUSPICION OF
ARSON HAS NOT BEEN CHARGED YET THERE IS A HEARING IN LESS THA AN HOUR AND WE WILL LEARN TH
CHARGES FROM THERE IT WILL BE INTERESTING THIS CAN GO ONE OF TWO WAYS. THEY CHARGE HIM FO
INTENTIONALLY SETTING THE FIRE THAT'S ITS OWN SET OF GUIDELINES
OR THEY CHARGE RIM FOR RECLE
RECKLESSLY STARTING ON FIRE. WITNESSES SAY THEY SAW HIM PUS THE CAR INTO THE GULLY
IF PEOPLE DIE AND MORE PROPERT IS BURNED UP, THERE COULD BE ENHANCEMENTS ON THE CHARGE ALREADY.
ALL OF IT WILL COME BACK TO TH ARSON CASE WE WILL LEARN MORE LATER O TODAY AND OF COURSE WE WIL
REPORT BACK TO YOU >> WE WILL CHECK BACK FO UPDATES, STEVE PATTERSON I

LET'S TALK OLYMPICS WE HAVE SEEN A LOT TODAY. WE HAVE SEEN SOME DRAMA AN THERE MAY BE MORE DRAMA ON THE
WAY. ONE OF THE MORE HYPED UP EVENT MAY NOT HAPPEN AT ALL, THE SWIMMING LEG OF THE TRIATHLON.
THIS IS THE ROUTE IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO DOWN THE SEINE RIVER TRAINING WAS CANCELED AGAI TODAY, SECOND DAY IN A ROW
BECAUSE OF CONCERNS ON HOW DIRTY THE RIVER WATER IS THE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE LEADER
SAY THEY ARE OPTIMISTIC IT WIL GO ON AS PLANNED TOMORROW. THAT IS REAL SOON CONSIDERING IT
IS ALMOST MIDNIGHT NOW IN PARIS. SINCE 2015, ORGANIZERS HAVE PU
IN $1.5 BILLION TO GET THE RIVER
CLEANEDED UP EARLIER, THE MAYOR TOOK A DIP TO SAY HEY, IF I CAN DO IT,
OLYMPIANS CAN DO IT. KEIR SIMMONS IS JOINING US NOW IT IS A LITTLE INCONCEIVABLE
THAT PARIS HAS KNOWN THEY WOUL HAVE THE OLYMPICS FOR THIS LON AND WE ARE ON THE EVE OF THE
TRIATHLON AND WHAT IS THE BACKUP PLAN DOES IT GO TO A BIATHLN?
>> WELL, THEY TRIED HARD THEY SPENT BILLIONS. WELL, THE BACKUP PLAN, THEY AR STILL HOPING IT HAPPEN
TOMORROW, THE OFFICIALS I SPOK TO THEY REALLY BELIEVE IT IT HAS RAINED A LOT AND THAT
BRINGS OUT THE E. COLI THE BACK UP PLAN IS TO POSTPON THE EVENTS BY A FEW DAYS O
CANCEL THE SWIMMING PORTION AN JUST HAVE THE RUNNING AND TH BIKING BUT THAT IS NOT A
TRIATHLON, RIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT PERHAPS WHAT THEY COULD DO IS MOVE IT TO
A DIFFERENT PART OF THE RIVER. I SWAM IN A TRIBUTARY TODAY.
>> HOW WAS IT? >> WELL, FINE. YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU WOUL VOUCH FOR THE IDEA THAT IT
WASN'T NECESSARILY FIN BEFOREHAND SO I'M NOT SURE O THE TEST
BUT IT WAS FINE. IT WAS A WHILE AGO
>> OKAY. >> I TRY AND PUT MY BEST FOO FORWARD WHEN I'M ON HALLIE
JACKSON NOW. >> I LOVE IT I TOTALLY GET IT THEY PUT IN AN EFFORT, I'M NOT
PUTTING A JUDGMENT ON THE SEIN RIVER CLEANLINESS. >> WE ARE ALLOWED TO JUMG. IT IS OUR JOB, I WOULD SAY
>> BUT THE TRIATHLON MAY NOT HAPPEN WHEN WILL THEY MAKE THE CALL A TO WHEN THEY WILL GET IN THE
SEINE? >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION FIRST OF ALL, THEY HAVE TO MAK THE CALL OVERNIGHT AND THEN EARLY IN THE MORNIN
AND THEN THEY WILL FIGURE IT OUT AND SAY WHETHER IT WILL HAPPEN TOMORROW THEY SAY IT STILL CAN HAPPEN
TOMORROW THEY ISSUED A STATEMENT AND SA THEY WILL GIVE REPORT CARDS OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS, THEY ARE AR
CONFIDENT THAT THE LEVELS WILL BEBELOW THE LIMITS BEFORE JULY
30 THEY ARE KIND OF SAYING WE ARE OKAY AND WE WILL DO IT YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP TOMORROW T
SEE THE TRIATHLON HAPPEN, MAYBE, HOPEFULLY. >> WELL, I'M DEFINITELY SLEEPING IN WE WILL SEE. SPEAKING OF SWIMMING AND THIS IS
AN EXCUSE TO SHOW YOU IN THE SEINE AGAIN. IN THE POOL EVENTS, THERE IS A
QUESTION OF WHETHER IT IS DEEP ENOUGH FOR SWIMMERS TO GET WORLD
RECORDS AND OLYMPIC RECORDS. WHAT IS UP WITH THAT >> 2.2 METERS NOT AS DEEP AS OLYMPIC POOLS HAVE BEEN IN THE
PAST SOME SUGGESTING THAT THAT'S TH BEST I'M NOT ON OLYMPIAN.
THAT IS NOT ME OLYMPIC SWIMMIN THERE BUT THE POINT ABOUT THAT STORY IS THE POOL IS SHALLOWER
SO APPARENTLY IT MEANS THERE - IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD REASON T
EXPLAIN WHY YOU DIDN'T GET GOLD. >> THAT SAID SWIMMING HAS BEEN DRAMATIC LOTS TO WATCH AND LOTS TO WATC
IN MEN'S GYMNASTICS. WE HAVE TO DO SPOILERS BECAUSE IT HAPPENED LIVE BUT THE
NEWSROOM WAS GLUED WITH THE US GYMNASTICS PULLING OUT SOMETHING
AMAZING HERE, RIGHT? >> YES, THE MEN'S GYMNASTICS HAVE NOT DONE THAT SINCE 2008.
YOU KNOW, THE WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS HAVE HAD ALL OF THE ATTENTIO AND RIGHTLY SO
LOOK AT SIMONE BILES BUT THEY WERE REALLY, REALLY
PSYCHOED THE SPECTATORS WENT CRAZY. THE GYMNASTS WENT CRAZY. THE CAMARADERIE BETWEEN THEM I SOMETHING TO WATCH AND NEVER HAS
A GOLD MEDAL FELT SO GOOD. JAPAN GOT GOLD AND SILVER BU AMERICA WAS CELEBRATING JUST A
LOUDLY >> KEIR SIMMONS, WE CELEBRAT YOU WITH THE LONG HOURS IN PARIS FOR US
YOU GOOD, EVERYTHING GOOD? >> ONLY FOR YOU, ONLY FOR YOU. ONLY WHEN IT IS YOU THAT I AGREE
TO BE HERE IT IS MIDNIGHT >> THAT'S GOOD OF YOU. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.
APPRECIATE YOU WE WILL TALK AGAIN SOON. >>> STILL AHEAD, A LOT MORE TO
GET TO ON THIS SHOW. INCLUDING WHY RESEARCHERS SA OZEMPIC COULD HELP WITH MORE
NOIL WE ARE LEARNING IN THE LAST HOUR ABOUT SOM UNEXPECTED POTENTIAL HEALT BENEFITS FROM WEIGHT LOSS DRUG
LIKE OZEMPIC AND WEGOVEY A NEW STUDY CAME OUT LOOKING A THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT DRUG AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
TYPE TWO DIABETES. SEMAGLUTIDE WHICH IS THE MAI INGREDIENT IN OZEMPIC COULD HELP
PEOPLE STOP SMOKING. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A ECDOTALLY DOCTORS HAVE BEE HEARING ABOUT FROM PATIENTS THAT
WHEN THEY ARE ON WEGOVEY, THEY HAVE LESS OF A CRAVING FOR ALCOHOL OR NICOTINE, EVE
OPIOIDS. PRESCRIPTIONS FOR THOSE DRUG HAVE SKY ROCKETED IN THE LAS YEAR, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE VER
EXPENSIVE, ABOUT $1,000 A MONT AND NOT ALL HEALTH INSURANCE
COVERS THEM. DR. AKSHAY SYAL IS JOINING U NOW. THERE ARE ALREADY DISCUSSIONS ON
THESE AND NOW THERE COULD BE ANOTHER IMPACT WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW TO FIN
OUT IF IT COULD HELPING WEIGHT LOSS AND ADDICTION >> RIGHT THIS HAS BEEN A TOPIC OF
INTEREST FOR SOME TIME NOW
PEOPLE ON THE DRUGS ARE HAVING REDUCED CRAVINGS FOR MORE THAN JUST FOOD. THEY CAUSE PEOPLE TO EAT LESS.
THERE ARE HEADLINES LIKE OZEMPIC IS RUINING THANKSGIVING BECAUS NO ONE WANTS TO EAT ANYMORE.
THEY ARE ALSO HAVING LESS OF A CRAVING FOR ALCOHOL AN CIGARETTES IT IS NOT THE GOLD STANDARD IN A
TRIAL THAT WE LOOK FOR BUT IT IS A LARGE STUDY OF OVER 200,00 PEOPLE FINDING THAT THOSE WITH
DIABETES WHO WERE PRESCRIBED THESE DRUGS HAD LOWER SMOKING.
MOST NOTICED WITHIN THE FIRS MONTH OR SO. >> WHY DOES IT HELP? >> IT IS A GOOD QUESTION
I THINK WE ARE STILL LEARNING. THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION IS THAT
IT REDUCES CRAVINGS FOR FOOD AND CIGARETTES CIGARETTES ARE THE LEADING CAUSE
OF PREVENTABLE DEATH, CAUSIN ONE OF FIVE DEATHS YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOU
PEOPLE TURNING TO MAGI MUSHROOMS TO STOP SMOKING. IT IS REALLY HARD TO QUIT. THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST AND
NUMEROUS TRIALS AROUND QUITTIN SMOKING AND EVEN COCAINE SO A LOT OF US ARE AWAITING TH
RESULTS. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH >>> STILL TO COME ON THE SHOW, WHY A TOUGH YEAR AT McDONALD'S
COULD MEAN
>>> IT TURNS OUT, BAD NEWS FOR McDONALD COULD MEET GOOD NEWS
FOR THE CUSTOMER. THE COMPANY'S LATEST EARNINGS FELL BELOW EXCITATION.
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TIGHTENING UP THEIR BELT, SO TO SPEAK. THEY ARE EATING AT HOME MORE SO
THEY HAVE FAST FOOD CHAINS TAKING A HIT MORE AND MORE. LOYAL CUSTOMERS ARE SEEING MUCH VALUE. -- MICKEY D'S ACKNOWLEDGING
CUSTOMERS THINK THEIR STUFF IS PRICED TOO HIGH. -- THE NEWLY DISCOUNTED VALUE
MEAL -- TO TRY TO LURE FOLKS
BACK. THEY WILL EXTEND THAT THROUGH THE REST OF THE SUMMER. -- IS JOINING US NOW. WOULD IT MAKE SENSE FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE NUMBER
PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO EXTENSIVE, CHARGE LESS, RIGHT?
>> -- McDONALD START DATE AND
THE DAY POSITIVE. CONSUMERS ARE FREAKING OUT ABOUT THE PRICE PACKAGE WE ARE SEEING. TALK ABOUT PRICE INFLATION, RIGHT?
FOOD PRICES HAVE BEEN UP 24%. WITH FOOD AWAY FROM HOME IS UP 27% IN SPRING OF, 2020. DINING OUT IS MORE THAN IT IS
FROM SHOPPING FOR GROCERIES AND COOKING AT HOME.
USING THIS IN THE PRICE OF MANY McDONALD FABLES WE ARE AWARE OF, A QUARTER POUND WITH CHEESE, BIG MAC, EGG McMUFFIN, ALL OF THOSE THINGS, 20% UP OR
MORE OVER FIVE YEARS AGO. AGAIN, THESE PRICES WILL NOT GO BACK DOWN. WILL NOT SEE SIMPLY A DOLLARS CHEESEBURGER GET.
THAT THE REASON McDONALD EVEN IF THEY CANNOT BRING BACK THE DOLLAR MENU, THEY ARE DRAWN TO RESORT TO OTHER MARKETING, LIKE
THE FIVE DOLLAR MEAL DEAL. THE ANNOUNCER THAT END OF JUNE, THEY WILL NOW EXTENDED THROUGH AUGUST.
>> IT'S NOT JUST McDONALD'S. WE'VE GOT SOME OTHER COMPANIES LIKE MORE BROADLY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM TRYING TO OFFER SUMMER DISCOUNTS TO KEEP PEOPLE ENGAGED, RIGHT? >> ABSOLUTELY. ARE BURGER KING AND WENDY'S,
SONIC ADVERTISING A FUN 99
MENU. THIS HAS ALL HAPPENED BASICALLY AT THE END OF JUNE. THAT WAS WHEN McDONALD'S ANNOUNCED THEIR FIVE DOLLAR MEAL DEAL. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE IMPACT
ON THE
TRIATHLON INTO A BIATHLON. WE WILL TAKE YOU ALIVE IN PARIS ARE AMONG THE RANKS OF SEINE
IN JUST A MINUTE. >>> -- THRONGED THE SUPREME
COURT HAIL MARY, IF YOU WILL. A SUPREME COURT OVERHAUL IN TEXAS.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES. SHE BACK AT CLAIMS FROM THE TOP HOUSE REPUBLICANS.
THEY SAID THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN IS WHAT TO GO NOWHERE IN CONGRESS. LISTEN TO THIS. >> -- DEAD ON ARRIVAL.
I THINK IS SPEAKING IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL. >> THIS COMES AT PRESIDENT
BIDEN'S RUNNING MATE IS LOOKING FOR A VP OF HER OWN -- EXACTLY
ONE WEEK AFTER VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS ENTERED THE DEMOCRATIC RACE, AS THE IMMEDIATE FRONT
RUNNER, READING SOMETHING LIKE $200 MILLION IN JUST A WEEK, HER CAMPAIGN SAYS IT'S MOST FROM
FIRST-TIME VOTERS. -- SCHAPIRO THE POINT A NEW
DESCRIPTION AGAINST THE REPUBLIC AND RIVAL. LISTEN. >> THEY ARE JUST WEIRD.
>> THESE GUYS ARE WEIRD. >> THAT WEIRD THING HE DOES.
WHILE HE'S HUGGING THE FLAG, YOU KNOW HE'S DOING? RIPPING AWAY OUR FREEDOM. >> WEIRD.
WE HEAR THAT WORD AGAIN AND AGAIN, ALONG WITH, CREEPY. -- JD VANCE, WHOSE FAVORABILITY
RATING IS DOWN EVEN AS HARRIS' IS A. -- ABOUT THIS SO-CALLED
CAT LADIES HE DESCRIBED RUNNING THE COUNTRY BACK IN 2021. WITH 99 DAYS TO GO, VANCE AND FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE GOING
TO BATTLEGROUND STATES AS THEY WRAP UP THEIR ATTACK AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET AS FAR AS IT EXISTS FOR THE MOMENT.
WE HAVE -- WITH THE LATEST ON THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IN PENNSYLVANIA. I WANT TO START WITH -- WHO IS
BEEN TRAVELING WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN IN TEXAS. PRESIDENT BIDEN CAPTURED SOME --
WITH THE HISTORICAL MOVE. A JUDICIAL OVERHAUL OF THE SUPREME COURT. [ INAUDIBLE ] TALK US THROUGH
IT. >> YOU ARE RIGHT, -- THE MOMENT
INTO HISTORICAL CONTEXT WITH THE SIGNING OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT BACK IN 1964, AND ISSUED
HELP TO BRING TO THE FOR AN ADDRESS. TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR MAKING SURE THERE WAS NOT
TERMINATION AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES. TO MAKE SURE SEGREGATION WAS NOT POSSIBLE IN PUBLIC SPACES
AND PUBLIC SCHOOL. THOSE WERE KEY POINTS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964.
THE PRESENCE TODAY REALLY SAYING IT'S INCUMBENT UPON HIM AND THE AMERICAN CITIZENS TO STRENGTHEN
THE GUARDRAIL OF DEMOCRACY. THAT END, HE SAYS PROPOSALS ARE DESIGNED TO DO JUST THAT.
HE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR MAKING SURE THERE'S A WAY TO CREATE TERM LIMITS FOR JUSTICES WHO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT. HE RECOMMENDED AN 18 YEAR TERM
FOR MEMBERS OF THE COURT. SAYING THE GOAL WAS TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NOT ONE PRESIDENT WHO COULD OVERLY
INFLUENCED GENERATIONS TO COME BY APPOINTING -- HE ALSO TALKED
ABOUT THE NEED FOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ENSURE THERE WAS A
CODE OF ETHICS THAT THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW, SIMILAR TO THAT -- JUSTICES HAVE TO FOLLOW.
ONE THAT WAS ENFORCEABLE AND ONE THAT WAS BINDING ON JUSTICES AS IT RELATES TO GIFTS AND POLITICAL ACTIVITIES, FOR
EXAMPLE. AND THEN THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THE TRUNCATES WE SAW THIS
SUMMER, WITH THE SAME THAT SUPREME COURT DECIDED THE PRESIDENTS HAVE -- IMMUNITY ON
OFFICIAL ACTS AND WHAT THEY CAN BE PUT THAT FOR PROSECUTED -- I
WANT YOU TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD TO SAY ABOUT THAT. HE KNOWS THAT PRESIDENT'S MUST BE -- UNDER LAW.
>> IS FOUNDED UNDER THE PRINCIPLE, THERE ARE NO KINGS IN AMERICA.
EACH OF US LEGAL -- [ INAUDIBLE ] NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN WENT ON TO SAY THE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT CREATED THIS NEW IDEA, HE SAYS, ON PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY
WAS ONE DESIGNED TO SERVE ONE PERSON, NOT ALL RESIDENT -- PRESIDENT'S -- IS TO SERVE
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP -- >> REAL QUICK, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT PRESIDENT BIDEN OVER THE
NEXT 99+ DAYS? DO WE EXPECT HIM TO HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?
PRESUMABLY WHERE THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN -- [ INAUDIBLE ]
>> THAT IS THE IDEA, HE INTENDS TO BE OUT THERE ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL SO -- COULD BE USEFUL TO PRESIDENT HARRIS AS SHE TRIES
TO WIN ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER. WE HAVE NOT GRIPPED THAT'S GOT -- GOT GREAT DETAIL.
PRESIDENT BIDEN -- IS A GOOD IDEA, THE THING HE TRIED TO CARRY FOR IN THE MONTH TO COME HERE YOU THIS IS THE ISSUE HE
BELIEVES IS THE ONE TO REALLY ELEVATE AS HE GOES INTO THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS OF HIS PRESIDENCY.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TASK. IN TERMS OF GETTING LEGISLATION
PASSED THAT WOULD CREATE THIS CODE OF ETHICS, A MORE ENFORCEABLE CODE OF ETHICS.
SOMETHING THAT WOULD PROBABLY REQUIRE DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF BOTH HOUSES -- PARTS OF CONGRESS. THE OTHER ISSUE THE PRESIDENT
BROUGHT UP WAS TERM LIMITS AND MAKING CONFIDENTIAL AMENDMENTS AROUND PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WOULD
REQUIRE CHANGING THE CONSTITUTION. WHICH AGAIN, IS NOT AN EASY FEE. IT'S AND 30+ YEARS SINCE THERE
WAS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, IT WAS AN OUTLIER, BUT THAT TOOK MORE THAN 200 YEARS TO GET RATIFIED.
OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS GOING TO BE A HEAVY LIFT FOR THE PRESIDENT GOING FORWARD. AND POTENTIALLY VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS IF SHE WERE TO WIN.
>> WE WILL LET YOU GO, THANK YOU. -- IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE THE RALLY IS JUST WRAPPING UP. THEY
ARE ALREADY RIPPING ON THE STAGE BEHIND YOU, IT MAKES IT. YOU SAW GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO
-- AND GRETCHEN WHITMER OF MICHIGAN. THEY RALLY FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT WHO WAS NOT THERE.
GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THE ROOM AND WHAT YOU HEARD FROM BOTH OF THESE -- AT ONE POINT, BOTH WERE CONSIDERED
TO BE POTENTIAL BE PEOPLE CONTENDERS. [ INAUDIBLE ] A LOT OF EITHER
ON JOSH SHAPIRO AND WHETHER HE WILL END UP ON THE TICKET. >> THAT IS RIGHT. JOSH SHAPIRO -- IS ON THE SHORT
LIST OF CONTENDERS. -- SHE IS SAID IS NOT
INTERESTED. [ INAUDIBLE ] SHAPIRO --
PENNSYLVANIA IS SO CRITICAL, IT CANNOT BE OVERSTATED HOW IMPORTANT THIS DATE IS.
HE IS A VERY POPULAR GOVERNOR. HE AND 61% APPROVAL RATING,
THAT IS HIGH. HE IS SOMEONE THAT HAS BRANDED HIMSELF AS A BIPARTISAN
GOVERNOR. HE SPEAKS TO BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. HE BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER.
HARRIS IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO IS SEEN AS A MODERATE, SOMEONE WHO CAN -- APPEAL TO
SWING VOTERS. HALLEY, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS EVENT IS A MONDAY IN THE -- OF SUMMER.
THIS WAS A MASSIVE CROWD FOR A HARRIS EVENT. 1300 PEOPLE AT LEAST.
IT WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC CROWD, CHANCE BREAKING OUT -- IT
STRUCK ME JUST HOW ENERGIZED THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND DEMOCRATIC VOTERS OF THIS DATE FEEL RIGHT NOW.
IF THIS IS REFLECTIVE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, THERE HAS BEEN A REAL SHIFT IN TONER, TENOR AND
SPIRIT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AISLE. >> THE QUESTION IS HOW THE RIGHT SIDE WILL HANDLE THAT
MOMENTUM. -- REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING TO
PAY HARRIS AND WHOEVER HER RUNNING MATE IS, AS TO LIBERALS,
TOO EXTREME FOR WHERE AMERICA IS. -- GOING AFTER JD VANCE, HE
SEEMS TO BE UNABLE TO -- THE CHILD IS CAT LADIES.
OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST 18 HOURS, HE DUG IN. HE SAID, PEOPLE ARE TAKING IT OUT OF CONTEXT. >> WITH A REAL TURN OF THE
TABLES, YOU SAID SPLIT SCREEN, THAT IS TOTALLY RIGHT. WE WERE JUST AT THE RNC WERE ALL EYES WERE ON THE DEEP STATE
OF THE REPUBLICAN SIDE -- THERE WAS SO MUCH TALK ABOUT UNITY WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AT
THAT CONVENTION. AND NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, HE IS OPPOSING VANCE -- A
CONTROVERSIAL CHOICE -- MEANWHILE, ON THE DEMOCRATIC
SIDE OF THE AISLE, YOU HAVE THIS NEW WAVE OF ENERGY.
WHERE DOES THE DYNAMICS GO FROM HERE? IT'S A REALLY GREAT QUESTION. I THINK WHAT WE'RE WATCHING FOR NOW IS TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT
THIS IS A SUGAR HIGH OR THE HONEYMOON PERIOD BEEN TALKING ABOUT, OR WHETHER HARRIS CAN SUSTAIN THIS.
[ INAUDIBLE ] THE RHETORIC ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE
AISLE HAS CHANGED. WITH THE WORD THEY'RE USING, WEIRD, CREEPY, A YOUNGER VIBE
OF TALKING. I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LISTEN TO GRETCHEN WHITMER TALKING ABOUT JD VANCE A FEW MOMENTS AGO.
>> HE IS SCARED OF US.
FOR DEMOCRATS, WE WANT EVERYONE TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. [ APPLAUSE ]
>> I MEAN, EVEN CAT LOVERS AND
DOG LOVERS ALIKE. >> ALREADY POKING FUN AT JD VANCE. AGAIN, THIS IS NOT THE VIBE I
FELT FROM DEMOCRATS IN QUITE SOME TIME. THIS ENERGY, THE APPROACH, THE
KIND OF WORDS THEY ARE USING. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH
HARRIS AS PART RUNNING MATE. -- IS JUST PALPABLE, THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW IN
PENNSYLVANIA, ESPECIALLY, WHICH IS SUPER IMPORTANT. >> [ INAUDIBLE ] THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. >>> SOUTH THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AS A FIRE BIGGER THAN THE CITY OF
L.A. BURNS THOUSANDS OF ACRES.
IT IS ONLY 12% CONTAINED. WE ARE GETTING A NEW LOOK AT SOME OF THE STUNNING NEW PICTURES OUT OF THE CITY OF -- IT IS UNRECOGNIZABLE, CHARRED
FROM 360,000 ACRES HAVE BURNED. MORE THAN 100 BUILDINGS DESTROYED. SO MANY MORE STILL AT RISK.
-- [ INAUDIBLE ] IS ALSO WINDY, AND THAT THREATENS TO SPREAD
THE FIRE EVEN MORE. IT IS BURNING REDNECK -- RIGHT NEXT TO THE CITY OF PARADISE,
THAT WAS A CITY DEVASTATED BY THE CAMPFIRE BACK IN 2018. SOME PEOPLE THERE HAD TO EVACUATE FOR THE SECOND TIME IN
JUST SIX YEARS.
>> I WAS READY TO GO TO BED AND I HEARD THIS POUNDING ON THE DOOR. I OPENED IT UP, HE GOES, FIRE DEPARTMENT.
GET YOUR STUFF, YOU ARE LEAVING. I SAID, NOT AGAIN. PLEASE, NOT AGAIN.
[ INAUDIBLE ] AND I HOPE IT IS STILL THERE WHEN I GET BACK.
>> RIGHT ABOUT NOW, THE MAN SUSPECTED OF STARTING THE FIRE ON PURPOSE IS FACING A JUDGE IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME. STEVE PATTERSON IS JOINING US --
TALK US THROUGH WHAT YOU'VE SEEN ON THE GROUND. THE IMAGES OF THE DEVASTATION ARE TOUGH TO SEE.
>> THE DESTRUCTION IN CERTAIN PLACES -- ABOUT DOZENS OR SO OF
THE HOMES AND STRUCTURES THAT WERE DESTROYED -- THE FIRE IS JUST SO HUGE. WE ARE JUST IN ONE, TINY
QUADRANT OF IT. IN A FIRE THAT IS NOW THE SIZE OF A LARGE AMERICAN CITY.
BURNING ON ALL FRONTS. FIREFIGHTERS HAVE HAD SUCCESS OVER THE LAST THREE OR FOUR DAYS.
IT IS COOL DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WAS A WHOLE LOT COOLER. THE REASON WHY THERE IS ANY
CONTAINMENT ON THE FIRE IS BECAUSE THAT REASON ALONE. AND IT'S BEEN SOME OF THE FIREFIGHTERS, THEY WERE ABLE TO
MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. -- ON A 360,000 ACRE FIRE IS
SIGNIFICANT. MEANWHILE, THE FIRE CONTINUES TO GROW. AND IT HAS GOTTEN HOT AGAIN. ANYTIME IT THAT HOT, IT
SUPERCHARGES -- [ INAUDIBLE ]
THE FRONT OF THE FIRE IS NOT JUST ONE PLACE, IT'S ANYTIME THE WIND BLOWS ESSENTIALLY,
FIREFIGHTERS ARE DEALING WITH THE NEW EDGE OF THE FIRE. MEANWHILE, WHAT IS LEFT IS
DESTRUCTION. YOU MENTIONED PARADISE AND THE FIRE THERE.
THE PERSONS ABLE TO STAND ON THEIR PROPERTY, YOU MAY SEE ALL THIS DESTRUCTION, THIS IS THEIR
SECOND HOME. THEIR FIRST HOME BURNED DOWN IN THE FIRE IN PARADISE SIX YEARS AGO, AND THEN THIS FIRE BURNED
IT DOWN. THEY TRIED TO SAVE HIS MONEY ARTIFACT AS THEY COULD FROM THE FIRST HOME, AND NOW THE SECOND
HOME IS BURNED. THIS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN -- ALL
OF THIS IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE ERA OR THE LIKE SIX YEARS THAT OF SUPERCHARGES THESE FIRES AND DESTROYED MUCH PROPERTY. >> [ INAUDIBLE ] THEY FIND IT
SO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEBODY MAY HAVE DONE IT ON PURPOSE. THAT IS THE ACCUSATION.
TALK ABOUT THE SUSPECT, THE COURT PROCEEDING, ANY ACCOUNTABILITY MOVING FORWARD? >> 42-YEAR-OLD -- HELD ON
SUSPICION OF ARSON. HE HAS NOT BEEN CHARGED YET. THERE IS A HEARING LEFT IN AN
HOUR OR SO. WE WILL LEARN THE CHARGE FROM HERE. IT WILL BE INTERESTING. THIS CAN GO ONE OF TWO WAYS.
THE EITHER CHARGE AND FOR INTENSELY SETTING THE FIRE, -- OR THEY CHARGE THEM FOR
RECKLESSLY SETTING THE FIRE. WITNESSES ON SCENE SAID THE GUY PUT SOMETHING IN A CAR, TURNED AROUND, THEY TURNED BACK AROUND
THE CARS ON FIVE. THEY PUSHED IT INTO A GULLY, IT STARTS THE FIRE. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS --
IF MORE PEOPLE DIE, -- MORE PROPERTY IS BURNED UP, THERE
COULD BE ENHANCEMENTS ON TOP OF THE CHARGES ALREADY. ALL LOOKING TO COME BACK TO THE ARSON CASE.
WE WILL LEARN A WHOLE LOT MORE LATER ON TODAY. AND OF COURSE, WE WILL REPORT BACK TO YOU.
>> WE WILL CHECK BACK FOR UPDATES. STEVE PATTERSON IN FRONT OF THAT DESTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA.
THANK YOU. >>> WE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE KILLED TODAY.
NINE MORE HURT AND WHAT POLICE ARE CALLING A FEROCIOUS STABBING ATTACK IN -- IN A
COMMUNITY CENTER NORTH OF LIVERPOOL, WHERE THERE WAS A -- DANCE READY FOR KIDS. A 17-YEAR-OLD IS NOW IN POLICE
CUSTODY. -- IS NOW TALKING ABOUT [ INAUDIBLE ]
>> IF YOU CAN IMAGINE. KIDS ON THE FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL VACATION, SIGNED UP FOR
WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY A VACATION WORKSHOP. THEME IN THE STYLE OF TAYLOR SWIFT. THEY WERE DOING DANCE, YOGA.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT GIRL BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIX AND 11 OF TO THE ONLINE LIST. THEY SHOW UP IN THE MIDDLE OF
THIS INCIDENT, THERE IS APPARENTLY A 17-YEAR-OLD WHO GOES ON A STABBING RAMPAGE, KILLING TWO OF THESE GIRLS,
INJURING ALL OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE. IN THE MEANTIME, PLEASE REALLY HAVE NOT YET FIGURED OUT WHAT
THE MOTIVE WAS. [ INAUDIBLE ] THIS IS WHAT THE POLICE CONSTABLE HAD TO SAY
ABOUT WHAT HAS UNFOLDED. >> -- [ INAUDIBLE ] HE STARTED
TO ATTACK [ INAUDIBLE ] -- WERE BRAVELY TRYING TO ATTACK THE
CHILDREN. >> THAT 17-YEAR-OLD HAS BEEN
CHARGED WITH MURDER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVE WAS, BUT POLICE SAY THEY DO NOT
BELIEVE IT WAS TERRORISM. THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ANOTHER SUSPECT, WHO ESSENTIALLY THEY BELIEVE HE ACTED ALONE.
IN THE MEANTIME, WE ARE HEARING FROM WITNESSES DESCRIBING CHILDREN BEING CARRIED OUT BLOODY OUT OF THIS OF IT.
PEOPLE TRYING TO RESUSCITATE THEM. AND ABSOLUTELY UNIMAGINABLE INCIDENT TODAY. >> VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE
DETAILS ABOUT THAT. -- LIFER MUST IN ENGLAND.
[ INAUDIBLE ] >>> WAITING TO SEE IF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAEL HAVE A
LOT -- AND HAS BLAH [ INAUDIBLE
] AND IS REALLY CONTROLLED TERRITORY. ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER VISITING
THE SITE OF THE ATTACK TODAY. SAYING ISRAELIS WILL HIT BACK HARD. >> -- THESE CHILDREN ARE OUR
CHILDREN. THEY ARE THE CHILDREN OF ALL OF US. THE STATE OF ISRAEL WILL NOT
AND CANNOT PUT UP WITH THIS. -- WILL COME AND IT WILL BE [
INAUDIBLE ] >> ISRAEL [ INAUDIBLE ] THIS IS
SOME OF THE FOOTAGE RELEASE FROM ISRAELI MILITARY FORCES HERE. -- CHILDREN HAD NO TIME TO [
INAUDIBLE ] SOME OF THE VICTIMS WERE AS YOUNG AS 10 YEARS OLD. -- IS IN [ INAUDIBLE ] HE IS
JOINING US AND IT. >> Reporter: HI, PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST ARE HOLDING THEIR BREATH AS WE WAIT
TO SEE WHAT ISRAEL'S RESPONSE WILL BE TO THE ROCKET ATTACK
THAT KILLED THOSE 12 CHILDREN UP IN THE GOLAN HEIGHTS OVER THE WEEKEND. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF
ISRAEL'S GOVERNMENT, THIS WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK.
THIS IS THE WORST ASSAULT ON ITS CIVILIANS SINCE OCTOBER 7. IT IS FAR WORSE THAN ANYTHING PREVIOUSLY WE HAVE SEEN IN
THESE 9.5 MONTHS OF FIGHTING BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HEZBOLLAH, THE IRANIAN BACKED MILITARY
GROUP IN LEBANON. NETANYAHU SAYS THE RESPONSES COMING AND IT WILL BE SEVERE.
THE QUESTION, WILL NETANYAHU GIVE THE ORDER FOR ISRAEL'S MILITARY TO ATTACK BEIRUT. THE CAPITOL OF LEBANON.
IT IS SOMETHING ISRAEL HAS REFRAINED FROM DOING SO FAR DURING THIS WAR. BUT THIS WAS A MAJOR ATTACK AND THAT YAHOO IS UNDER INTENSE
PRESSURE FROM THE FAR RIGHT OF HIS GOVERNMENT TO RESPOND IN A MAJOR WAY. THE U.S. IS SAYING IT SUPPORTS
ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF, BUT IT'S ALSO -- RESTRAINT.
IT IS NOT WHAT TO SEE AN ALL OUT WAR ON ISRAEL'S NORTHERN BORDER, ESPECIALLY AT THE TIME WHEN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION
IS FEELING MORE HOPEFUL ABOUT THE CHANCES OF FINALIZING A CEASE-FIRE DEAL IN GAZA.
THEY WERE ALREADY THE NEGOTIATIONS. THEY WOULD GET MORE COMPLICATED
IF THERE IS AN ALL-OUT WAR. HAS BLAH -- HEZBOLLAH HAS
DENIED THE ATTACK -- THIS THING IT WAS HEZBOLLAH THAT PULLED
THE TRIGGER. THE ROCKET CAME DOWN IN A VILLAGE CALLED -- WE WERE THERE
EARLIER TODAY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THIS IS A VILLAGE OF 11,000 PEOPLE.
TO LOSE THAT MANY CHILDREN IN A SINGLE DAY IS JUST AGONY ON A MASSIVE, MASSIVE SCALE.
THIS WAS A NORMAL SATURDAY NIGHT. A LITTLE AFTER 6:00 P.M. THESE KIDS WERE OUT ON A SOCCER FIELD WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE
SIREN STARTED BLARING AND JUST SECONDS LATER, THE ROCKET CAME CRASHING DOWN. IT NOT ONLY BROUGHT DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TO THAT COMMUNITY,
IT HAS NOW PUT THE ENTIRE REGION ON EDGE. >> THANKS TO YOU.
>>> MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE HURT, WE WILL SHOW YOU SOME OF THE
AFTERMATH. >>> ELON MUSK -- SPREADING A MISLEADING VIDEO ABOUT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS.
WE WILL BE BACK IN A BIT.
>>> DOWNPOURS AT -- SOAKING VISITORS, FORCING SOME STUFF TO
BE SHUT DOWN. >>> ONE OF THE MOST HYPED OLYMPIC EVENT MAY NOT HAPPEN
TO. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SWIMMING SIDE OF THE TRIATHLON. -- YOU SEE THE ROUTE FOR THE
SWIM IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE SEINE RIVER. THE PROBLEM IS, THE SEINE HAS A DIRTY WATER.
-- OLYMPICS LEADERS ARE SEEING
THEIR OPTIMISTIC THINGS WILL GO ON AS PLANNED TOMORROW. REMEMBER, SINCE 2016, ORGANIZERS HAVE INVESTED ONE
HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO CLEAN UP THE SEINE. EARLIER THIS MONTH, THE MAYOR
SHOWED IT WAS FINALLY CLEANED UP. HERE IS -- JOINING US NOW.
TO THE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING, IS A LITTLE -- THAT PARIS HAS NO
THEY WILL HAVE THE OLYMPICS FOR THIS LONG, AND THEY HAVE KNOWN THEY HAD THIS ISSUE WITH THE
SEINE FOR THIS LONG, WHAT IS THE BACKUP PLAN? DOES IT TURN INTO A BIATHLON? >> IT IS REALLY HARD.
THEY SPENT BILLIONS. FOR THE BACKUP CLIENT -- PLAN,
-- THEY REALLY BELIEVE IT.
EVERYONE HAS THOUGHT THE RAIN. THAT BRINGS OUT -- POSTPONE THE
TRIATHLON EVENT FOR A FEW DAYS, OR EVEN CANCEL THE SWIMMING PORTION AND HAVE THE RUNNING
AND THE BIKING. THAT IS NOT TRIATHLON, IT'S A BIATHLON.
I ALSO HAVE HEARD THAT PERHAPS WHAT THEY COULD DO IS --
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE RIVER. I'VE SWAM IN -- TODAY. >> HOW WAS IT?
>> I AM FINE. I THINK YOU WOULD VOUCH WITH THE IDEA THAT I WAS POSITIVELY
FINE BEFORE FRONT -- BEFOREHAND, -- IT WAS A WHILE AGO.
[ INAUDIBLE ] I TRY TO PUT MY
BEST FOOT FORWARD. >> I LOVE IT. I TOTALLY GET IT.
I AM NOT MAKING A JUDGMENT ON THE SEINE RIVER CLEANLINESS HERE.
>> WE ARE ALLOWED TO JUDGE. IS ACTUALLY OUR JOB. >> IT'S INTERESTING THAT
LITERALLY THE TRIATHLON MAY NOT EVEN HAPPEN. WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE THE CALL AS TO WHETHER THE SWIMMERS
WILL GET INTO THE SEINE OR NOT? >> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION.
[ INAUDIBLE ] [ INAUDIBLE ] IN
A RECENT STATEMENT, THEY SAID GIVEN THE FORECAST OVER THE
NEXT 36 HOURS -- THEY ARE CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL RETURN [
INAUDIBLE ] YOU MIGHT WAKE UP
TOMORROW TO SEE THE TRIATHLON HAPPEN. >> WE WILL SEE.
[ INAUDIBLE ] IN THE POOL EVENT, AND THE OLYMPICS POOL, THERE IS
A QUESTION OF WHETHER IT DEEP ENOUGH TO GET WORLD RECORDS AND
OLYMPIC RECORDS. >> -- NOT AS BIG AS OLYMPIC POOLS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST.
SOME ARE SUGGESTING -- THE
POINT ABOUT THAT STORY IS, -- APPARENTLY MEANS THERE ARE MORE
WAYS FOR OTHER COMPETITORS [ INAUDIBLE ] IS SOMEWHAT A GOOD
REASON TO EXPLAIN WHY YOU DID NOT GET GOLD. >> THAT SAID -- HAS BEEN VERY DRAMATIC.
LOTS TO WATCH THERE AND LEFT THE WATCH IN GYMNAST -- GYMNASTICS.
THE NEWSROOM WAS GLUED TO WHAT WAS GOING ON. [ INAUDIBLE ] >> -- THE MEN'S GYMNASTIC TEAM
IN USA SINCE 2008. THE WOMEN JUST MASTIC [
INAUDIBLE ] LOOK AT SIMONE BILES THIS WEEK, EXTRAORDINARY.
THEY WERE REALLY, REALLY SIKES. -- WENT CRAZY.
THE COME ROBBERY BETWEEN THEM IS WONDERFUL TO WATCH, ACTUALLY. NEVER HAS A GOLD MEDAL FELT SO
GOOD. CHINA AND JAPAN GOT GOLD AND SILVER, BUT THE U.S. WAS
CELEBRATING JUST AS LIVELY. >> WE ARE CELEBRATING YOU DOING LONG HOURS.
ARE YOU GOOD? ANYTHING GOOD? >> ONLY WHEN IT'S YOU I AGREE.
TO [ INAUDIBLE ] >> I APPRECIATE YOU. WE WILL TALK AGAIN SOON.
>>> LET'S GET YOU TO THE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW TONIGHT.
POLICE IN NEW YORK LOOKING FOR A SUSPECT IN A SHOOTING IN A PARK THAT KILLED TWO PEOPLE AND HURT OTHERS.
-- SOMEBODY OPENED FIRE LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
POLICE SAY ANYONE WHO HAS INFORMATION OR VIDEOS TO GET IN TOUCH ASAP. >>> A BLOOD TEST CAN DIAGNOSE
ALZHEIMER'S ABOUT 90% OF THE TIME. THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE -- FROM
A DOCTORS VISIT WORTH 60 TO 70% ACCURACY [ INAUDIBLE ] >>> REALLY INTENSE
THUNDERSTORM. LOOK AT THE FLASH FLOODING TO -- AT THE THEME PARK IN TENNESSEE.
THEY SAY IT COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF SO MUCH RAIN. -- VISITOR TRYING TO WAIT THROUGH WATER AND SOME PART TO TRY TO GET OUT.
FORTUNATELY -- [ INAUDIBLE ]
WAS OUT WITH ITS FIRST VERSION OF A I CALLED APPLE INTELLIGENCE. IT IS MEANT TO MAKE THEORY BETTER, AND GENERATE EMAIL
AUTOMATICALLY. IT WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO REGISTERED APPLE DEVELOPER THAT FIRST, BUT WILL ROLL OUT TO THE
PUBLIC -- NUMBER FIVE, DRAGONFLIES ACROSS RHODE ISLAND.
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM AT A BEACH NEARBY. [ INAUDIBLE ] THE SKY WAS PITCH
BLACK. WE LOVE THE DRAMA.
[ INAUDIBLE ] IT CLEARED OUT A
COUPLE MINUTES EARLY. EXPERTS SAY, STRENGTH LIKE THIS ARE FAIRLY COMMON. DRAGONFLIES -- TO FIND OUT WINTER HABITAT.
>>> ELON MUSK MEETING -- FACING CRITICISM VERSION OF FAKE
CAMPAIGN AT OF KAMALA HARRIS -- IS CALLED DIRECT VIOLATION OF
THE ROOF ON HIS OWN PLATFORM, ASK. X. MUST RETWEETED A PARODY VIDEO
THAT USES A I GENERATED VOICEOVERS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE KAMALA HARRIS CALLS HERSELF INCOMPETENT.
[ INAUDIBLE ] AND SHE LEAVES HERSELF AS "A DIVERSITY HIRE".
USE THE RHETORIC THAT SOME REPUBLICANS UP WITHOUT, ACCUSING HARRIS OF BEING AN DEI
HIGHER. [ INAUDIBLE ] SPREADING FALSE
MISLEADING INFORMATION ONLINE. MUST LATER CLARIFIED THAT THE
VIDEO WAS SATIRE. X AND MUSK DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RESPOND -- WHAT ARE SOME OF THE
DETAILS? >> IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE I WANT TO PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF.
IT IS IN FACT SATIRE, BUT SATIRE IS NOT REALLY -- YOU THINK ABOUT THE ALMOST 200
MILLION FOLLOWERS. -- GETTING ALREADY [ INAUDIBLE ] IT'S BEEN TRACKING OVER THE
LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. IT WAS ORIGINALLY POSTED AS HE TALKED ABOUT, BY A YOUTUBE
ACCOUNT CALLED -- IT WAS LABELED, PARODY WHAT WAS
ORIGINALLY POSTED BY THE YOUTUBE ACCOUNT. WHEN MUST RETWEETED IT -- IT
WAS NOT LABELED AS PARITY. KAMALA HARRIS A I GENERATED VOICE -- I WANT TO REITERATE
THIS, CALLING HERSELF AN DEI HIGHER. GOING ON TO SAY, THE PRESIDENT
IS ONE OF THE REASONS SHE IS TAKING OVER.
[ INAUDIBLE ] I WANT TO READ PART OF THE POLICIES ELON MUSK HAS SPOKEN -- BROKEN AT X. IT
SAYS, "YOU MAY NOT SHARE SYNTHETIC, MANIPULATED, OR OUT
OF CONTEXT MEDIA THAT MAY DECEIVE OR CONFUSE PEOPLE AND LEAD TO HARM.
MISLEADING MEDIA. IN ADDITION, WE MAY LABEL POST CONTAINING MISLEADING MEDIA TO
HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEIR AUTHENTICITY, AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONTEXT." MUSCA
SAID, THIS IS PARITY. IS NOT BREAKING THE LAW. KAMALA HARRIS'S CAMPAIGN IS
SPEAKING OUT THING, WE BELIEVE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT THE
FREEDOM -- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS IS OFFERING, NOT THE DAY, MANIPULATED LIES OF ELON MUSK AND DONALD TRUMP.
131 -- 101 MILLION VIEWS -- IF
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS, YOU REALLY CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS A I
GENERATED VOICE AND THE VICE PRESIDENT'S VOICE.
SOMEONE ASKED ME A QUESTION, REMEMBER THERE WAS A ROBLE CALL
FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO DURING THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. AND THAT WAS ALSO A I
GENERATED. IT WAS A FAKE CALL DISSUADING FOLKS TO TURN OUT TO THE NEW
HAMPSHIRE PRIMARIES. THIS IS BECOMING A MUCH BIGGER ISSUE. >> TALK ABOUT THAT.
>> A.I. IS A NEW THING AND WE KNOW THAT. WILL WE AVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
THE PRESIDENT THAT SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BEEN SETTING. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TIMES IN
WHICH WE WERE TALKING ABOUT -- ITEM NUMBER 2014 AND 2015.
-- WAS POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. WE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER A TERROR ORGANIZATION LIKE ISIS
SHOULD BE ABLE TO POST ANYTHING. THERE WAS NOT A PRESIDENT -- PRECEDENT. -- YOU GO BACK TO
MARK ZUCKERBERG IN HIS TESTIMONY, YOU GO BACK TO 2020 AS WELL, AND THE MISLEADING
INFORMATION WHICH -- AND FACEBOOK WERE ACCUSED OF
PUTTING FORWARD, OR NOT SINCERELY BREAKING THEM DOWN. BY THE WAY, THERE IS A NEW U2
POLICY. LET ME READ THIS FOR YOU, THEY SAY THEY WILL START
REMOVING CONTENT FALSELY CLAIMING THE 2020 ELECTION WAS IN FACT MANUFACTURED.
WITH REGARD TO VOTER FRAUD. THEY SAY THE REASON WHY THEY KIND OF CHANGED THEIR POLICY AT
U2 WAS BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO OPENLY DEBATE POLITICAL IDEAS. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT, TO TALK
ABOUT THIS IN THE BIGGER PICTURE WAY, THE YOUTUBE OF THE 2020 ELECTION WITH DONALD TRUMP
-- THAT IT WAS FRAUDULENT, AS A POLITICAL IDEA -- IT WAS
OFFENSIVE AND ALIVE. AND YOUTUBE LAST YEAR WAS SAYING THEY WANT THIS TO BE PART OF THE DEBATE IN DEBATING
POLITICAL IDEAS. ONE MORE THING, THE S.E.C. IS [ INAUDIBLE ] TO MANDATE
DISCLOSURE -- DISCLOSURE OF A I GENERATED -- CLINICAL AD, I
CANNOT READ MY OWN WRITING. THEY MAY NOT GOING TO AFFECT BEFORE THE ELECTION.
THIS IS -- YOU HAVE TO PUT OUT THERE THIS IS A I GENERATED
POLITICAL AD. BUT IT WILL NOT GO INTO EFFECT BY NOVEMBER. THEY SEE THERE IS A PROBLEM,
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL FIX IT IN TIME IS THE ISSUE. >> WE ARE GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON TOP OF THIS FOR US.
>>> COMING UP, -- IN THE VENEZUELA PRESIDENT ELECTION.
SAYING THEY WON. TABLE CANNOT BE CORRECT. WHAT IS THE DEAL?
WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE NOW? >>> THOUSANDS OF -- FINDING A CHEAT CODE TO SEE COMMUNICATIVE
SHOW FOR FREE.
>>> NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.
THE FBI SAYING MR. TRUMP HAS AGREED TO GIVE -- INTERVIEW. IT COMES AS LOCAL S.W.A.T.
TEAM MEMBERS, NOT THE FEDS, SAID THEY HAD NO COMMUNICATION WITH THE SECRET SERVICE UNTIL
AFTER IT HAPPENED. THEY SPOTTED THE GUNMEN NEARLY TWO HOURS BEFORE THE ATTACK
HAPPENED. >> WE HAVE CONFIRMED WHEN HE PUT THAT INFORMATION OUT TO THE MAN, HIS COMMAND TOOK THAT
INFORMATION AND DID SOMETHING WITH IT. WE DO NOT KNOW IF THEY DID. WE SUPPOSED TO GET A FACE-TO
FACE BRIEFING FROM THE SECRET SERVICE MEMBERS WHENEVER THEY ARRIVED, BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENED.
I THINK THAT WAS PROBABLY A PIVOTAL POINT WHERE I STARTED THINKING -- BECAUSE THAT NEVER
HAPPENS. >> I WANT TO BRING IN --. LET
START WITH THIS -- BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED LOCALLY -- WAS TAPPING
FEDERALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE INVESTIGATION. THE FBI HELD A BRIEFING TODAY AND THEY WOULD SPECIFICALLY NOT
GET INTO THE SECURITY FAILURES AROUND THE EVACUATION ATTEMPTS. >> THAT IS RIGHT. DISTRACTING SOUND YOU PLAYED,
THE PLOT IS THICKENING. WHAT WE HAD TODAY WAS A BRIEFING FROM THREE FBI OFFICIALS WHO GAVE THE MOST
RECENT INFORMATION THEY COULD ON THE STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION.
450 PEOPLE, INCLUDING FAMILY NUMBERS AND FRIEND. THEY HAD SUBPOENAED 86 SOCIAL MEDIA AND -- ACCOUNT FOR EVERY
PIECE OF SOCIAL MEDIA DOES THEY COULD FIND. THOUGH, THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD
INSIGHT INTO WHY THEY DID -- HE DID THE SHOOTING. WE HAVE THE HEAD OF THE
PITTSBURGH FBI FIELD OFFICE. TAKE A LOOK. >> WE HAVE LEARNED THE SUBJECT WAS HIGHLY ATTENDED --
INTELLIGENT, ATTENDED COLLEGE AND MAINTAINED THAT THE EMPLOYMENT. HIS PRIMARY SOCIAL CIRCLE
APPEARS TO BE LIMITED TO HIS MEDIA FAMILY. AS WE BELIEVE, HE HAS FEW
FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE. WE'VE IDENTIFIED OUR SUBJECTS'
INTEREST IN SHOOTING BEGAN AS A HOBBY, AND REQUEST PROGRESSED INTO FORMAL FIREARMS TRAINING COURSES, PARTICULARLY SINCE
SEPTEMBER, 2023. >> THEY SAID HE PLANNED THIS ACT METICULOUSLY. HE BEGAN BUYING BOMB MATERIAL
THE YEAR BEFORE THE RALLY. AND HE WAS GOOGLING OTHER MASS
SHOOTING EVENTS, AND EVEN THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF -- PRIME MINISTER LAST YEAR. WHICH SUGGEST HE WAS MORE
ORIENTED TOWARD SEEKING NOTORIETY THAN HAVING A PULLED SECULAR -- A PARTICULAR --
AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. >> WHAT ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY FACTOR?
THERE'S ALSO A POTENTIALLY CRITICAL HEARING -- WHAT ARE THESE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES?
>> THERE ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. [ INAUDIBLE ] THE ACTING SECRET
SERVICE MEMBER, WHETHER HE CAN CONTINUE TO SURVIVE IF THE
SECRET SERVICE REFUSES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AS THEY DID AT THE LAST HEARING. I ASKED THE FBI TODAY, THIS GUY
FLUID DROVE TWO HOURS BEFORE DONALD TRUMP SPOKE OVERHEAD, I ASKED, WASN'T THERE A NO FLY
ZONE AT THAT POINT? DIDN'T THE SECRET SERVICE HAVE -- CAPABILITY?
THEY SAID, YOU HAVE TO ASK THE SECRET SERVICE THAT QUESTION. MAYBE SOMEBODY WILL TOMORROW. [ INAUDIBLE ] [ INAUDIBLE ]
>> MORE TO COME ON THIS. [ INAUDIBLE ]
>>> THINGS ARE HEATING UP IN VENEZUELA WITH PROTESTERS ON THE STREET IN BIG NUMBERS.
PEOPLE IN -- WITH POLICE LINING UP TO POTENTIALLY FACE OFF WITH THEM. ALL BECAUSE OF A NEW POLITICAL STANDOUT, AFTER AN ELECTION
THAT LED THE AUTOCRATIC LEADER AND OPPOSITION THING THEY WON. PRESIDENT -- MADERO SAID HE WON
ABOUT SEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS. -- ARE CASTING DOUBT ON A. HIS OPPONENT WILL CHALLENGE THE
RESULT, BUT THEY HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE HARD DATA THEY NEED FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
THEY ONLY HAVE -- FROM ABOUT A THIRD OF BALLOT BOXES IN VENEZUELA. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE
HEARING REPORTS OF GANGS AND -- ON MOTORCYCLES [ INAUDIBLE ] IS
VERY SIMPLE, DAVID, THERE CANNOT BE TWO WINNERS IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN
VENEZUELA. HOW DOES THIS END UP? HOW DOES IT PLAY OUT?
>> THE QUESTION OF WHO WON THIS ELECTION IS NOTABLE.
IS A REAL ELECTION FOR WITH REAL PEOPLE WITH REAL VOTING MACHINES THAT HAVE BEEN AUDITED BY INDEPENDENT -- THEY PRODUCE
PAPER RECEIPTS, BASICALLY. FOR TALLIES OF THE VOTE.
THOSE ARE THE PAPER TALLIES THE GOVERNMENT, SO FAR IS REFUSING TO BELIEVE -- RELEASED TO BACK UP ITS CLAIM THAT THEY WON.
-- SAYS HE GOT ENOUGH OF THE PAPER TALLIES FROM IN PERSON WITNESSES TO SAY THEY CAN
STATISTICALLY CONCLUDE THAT THEY WON WITH ABOUT 70% OF THE VOTES. BUT WE WILL NOT KNOW UNLESS THE
GOVERNMENT IS TRANSPARENT IN PROVIDING THE EVIDENCE HE NEEDS TO PROVIDE FOR US TO KNOW WHERE
THIS ELECTION WHILE THE. AS FAR AS WORK AND GO IN THE SHORT TERM -- IT DEPENDS ON A
FEW FACTORS. PRESSURE FROM BELOW. THE PROTESTS, HOW BIG DO THEY GET? HOW VIOLENT? TWO, PRESSURE FROM ABROAD.
THE UNITED STATES, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, COUNTRIES LIKE BRAZIL AND -- THEY COULD PUT
PRESSURE ON THE GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE AND RESULTS, OR AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE -- AND
THEN, THE LAST QUESTION IS, WHETHER THE RULING COALITION WILL REMAIN COHERENT, OR
WHETHER IT WILL FRACTURE. PARTICULARLY WHETHER THE MILITARY WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT -- THEY HAVE ALWAYS
SUPPORTED MADURO. THAT MIGHT CHANGE DEPENDING ON HOW THESE OTHER FACTORS LINEUP.
>> IF IT ENDS UP BEING MADURO,
WHAT WOULD A THIRD TERM MEAN FOR VENEZUELA? AND THE FOLKS WHO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY? THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A GEOPOLITICAL RIPPLE EFFECT.
>> THE U.S. S AN IMPORTANT PLAYER.
THE RECENT HISTORY OF VENEZUELA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MASS MIGRATIONS IN RECENT MEMORY. ABOUT 7.7 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE
LEFT THE COUNTRY IN RECENT YEARS, A LITTLE LESS THAN 10% HAVE CROSSED INTO THE U.S.,
MOST ARE IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA.
THAT OUTMIGRATION AS A RESULT OF ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF NICOLAS MADURO.
-- ONE OF WHICH IS REALLY INTENSE SANCTIONS. WHICH THE U.S. WILL LIKELY
CONTINUE IF MADURO STAYS IN POWER, ANTONY BLINKEN TALKED
ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT. HE DID PRONOUNCE HIMSELF ON THE SUPPOSE IT RESULT OF THE
ELECTION. TAKE A LISTEN. >> WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THE RESULTS ANNOUNCED DO
NOT REFLECT THE WILL OR ROADS OF THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE.
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IS WATCHING THIS VERY CLOSELY. AND WILL RESPOND ACCORDINGLY.
>> RESPONDED ACCORDINGLY, IT'S HARD TO RESPOND OTHER THAN MORE SANCTION. WHICH WOULD ONLY MAKE US -- AND
WILL LEAD TO MORE PEOPLE LEAVING THE COUNTRY AND POTENTIALLY WINDING UP HERE. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT.
>>> BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO WEED OR WATERLESS TO THE MALL,
OUR STORIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE DONE THEM FOR YOU. [ INAUDIBLE ] THE INTERNET AS
BACK AND THINGS ARE GETTING BACK TO NORMAL AFTER PROTEST THERE. IT BEGAN LAST MONTH WHEN
STUDENTS PROTESTED CONTROVERSIAL JOB QUOTA SYSTEM -- IT TURNED DEADLY WITH 150 PEOPLE KILLED.
-- SETUP PATROLLING IN THE STREET AND CUT INTERNET SERVICE. BUT SEVERAL WEEKS AGO -- [
INAUDIBLE ] >>> THE TRAIN WAS ABOUT HAGEMAN -- 800 PEOPLE ON BOARD/TOW
TRUCK. 52 PEOPLE HURT, DOESN'T HAVING TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
AT LEAST EIGHT CARRIAGES AT -- WE ARE LOOKING AT THE AFTERMATH HERE. >> IN GERMANY -- CATCHING THE
ERRORS TO HER FOR FREE. 25,000 PEOPLE SHOWED UP ON THE CELL SITE ON SATURDAY, -- MOORE
ON SUNDAY. IF YOU ARE NOT DROPPING ALL THAT MONEY, MAYBE THAT'S NOT A
BAD DEAL AFTER ALL. >>> STILL AHEAD, -- HAVE MORE BENEFITS? WHY RESEARCHERS SAY COULD HELP
KICK ADDICTION. LATER IN THE SHOW.
>>> IS SOMETHING ADDED NOTABLY DOCTORS HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT FROM PATIENT, WITH THEIR OWN
OZEMPIC OR GOBI, THEY HAVE LESS OF A CRAVING FOR ALCOHOL, OR NICOTINE, OR EVEN FOR OPIOIDS, SOME SAY. -- DRUGS HAVE SKYROCKETED FOR
THE LAST YEAR. FOR OZEMPIC AND WE GOBI, EACH DESK WILL EVEN THOUGH EACH OF
THOSE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE.
>> SUPER INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPACT AND EFFECT OF
OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY AND SOME OF THESE -- NOW IT SEEMS THERE COULD BE ANOTHER IMPACT. WHAT CAN YOU KNOW TO KNOW IF IT
WILL TREAT WEIGHT LOSS AND ADDICTION? >> THIS IS BEEN A TOPIC OF INTEREST FOR SOME TIME.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN NOTICING -- PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THESE DRUGS
ARE HAVING REDUCED TO CRAVINGS FOR MORE THAN JUST FOOD. WE KNOW THESE DRUGS AND CAUSE PEOPLE TO EAT LESS.
THERE INTERESTING HEADLINES THAT OZEMPIC IS RUNNING THANKSGIVING BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO EAT ANYMORE.
PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THAT N THESE DRUGS PEOPLE HAVING LESS CRAVINGS FOR THINGS LIKE ALCOHOL AND CIGARETTES, AND EVEN GAMBLING AS WELL.
IT IS NOT THE GOLD STANDARD RANDOMIZED TRIAL WE LOOK FOR,
AND A LARGE STUDY OF OVER 20,000 PEOPLE ESSENTIALLY FINDING THOSE WITHOUT DIABETES OR PRESCRIBED DRUGS HAVE LOWER RATES OF UTILIZATION FOR SMOKING -- SMOKING.
>> WHY DOES IT HELP? >> IT IS A GOOD QUESTION.
WE ARE STILL LEARNING TO FIND OUT. THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION IS IT REDUCES CRAVINGS. CRAVINGS FOR FOOD, CRAVING FOR
CIGARETTES. CIGARETTES ARE THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DEATH IN
THE COUNTRY, CAUSING ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE DEATHS AND ABOUT HALF 1 MILLION DEATHS IN THIS
COUNTRY DUE TO SMOKING. YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE TURNING TO MAGIC MUSHROOMS TO STOP SMOKING. IT'S A HARD THING TO QUIT.
THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST AROUND THIS WITH NUMEROUS TRIALS IN TERMS OF QUITTING SMOKING, ALCOHOL AND EVEN COCAINE.
[ INAUDIBLE ] >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SUPER INTERESTING.
>>> STILL TO COME, BY A TOUGH YEAR AT McDONALD'S COULD MEAN
>>> IT TURNS OUT, BAD NEWS FOR McDONALD COULD MEET GOOD NEWS
FOR THE CUSTOMER. THE COMPANY'S LATEST EARNINGS FELL BELOW EXCITATION.
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TIGHTENING UP THEIR BELT, SO TO SPEAK. THEY ARE EATING AT HOME MORE SO
THEY HAVE FAST FOOD CHAINS TAKING A HIT MORE AND MORE. LOYAL CUSTOMERS ARE SEEING MUCH VALUE. -- MICKEY D'S ACKNOWLEDGING
CUSTOMERS THINK THEIR STUFF IS PRICED TOO HIGH. -- THE NEWLY DISCOUNTED VALUE
MEAL -- TO TRY TO LURE FOLKS
BACK. THEY WILL EXTEND THAT THROUGH THE REST OF THE SUMMER. -- IS JOINING US NOW. WOULD IT MAKE SENSE FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE NUMBER
PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO EXTENSIVE, CHARGE LESS, RIGHT?
>> -- McDONALD START DATE AND
THE DAY POSITIVE. CONSUMERS ARE FREAKING OUT ABOUT THE PRICE PACKAGE WE ARE SEEING. TALK ABOUT PRICE INFLATION, RIGHT?
FOOD PRICES HAVE BEEN UP 24%. WITH FOOD AWAY FROM HOME IS UP 27% IN SPRING OF, 2020. DINING OUT IS MORE THAN IT IS
FROM SHOPPING FOR GROCERIES AND COOKING AT HOME.
USING THIS IN THE PRICE OF MANY McDONALD FABLES WE ARE AWARE OF, A QUARTER POUND WITH CHEESE, BIG MAC, EGG McMUFFIN, ALL OF THOSE THINGS, 20% UP OR
MORE OVER FIVE YEARS AGO. AGAIN, THESE PRICES WILL NOT GO BACK DOWN. WILL NOT SEE SIMPLY A DOLLARS CHEESEBURGER GET.
THAT THE REASON McDONALD EVEN IF THEY CANNOT BRING BACK THE DOLLAR MENU, THEY ARE DRAWN TO RESORT TO OTHER MARKETING, LIKE
THE FIVE DOLLAR MEAL DEAL. THE ANNOUNCER THAT END OF JUNE, THEY WILL NOW EXTENDED THROUGH AUGUST.
>> IT'S NOT JUST McDONALD'S. WE'VE GOT SOME OTHER COMPANIES LIKE MORE BROADLY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM TRYING TO OFFER SUMMER DISCOUNTS TO KEEP PEOPLE ENGAGED, RIGHT? >> ABSOLUTELY. ARE BURGER KING AND WENDY'S,
SONIC ADVERTISING A FUN 99
