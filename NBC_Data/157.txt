OF WEDNESDAY'S HISTORIC OLYMPIC HIGHLIGHTS. >>> SPEAKING OF HISTORIC OR
ICONIC, LET'S BRING IN OUR SPORTS REPORTER JIMMY ROBERTS WHO IS A HOST ON NBC'S GOLF CHANNEL. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
PARIS MARKS THE 20th OLYMPIC GAMES YOU'VE COVERED, WHICH IS INCREDIBLE MILESTONE AND YOU
REMAIN ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORYTELLERS. WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR FAVORITE MOMENT SO FAR? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO MOST NOW TOO?
>> YOU KNOW, EVERY DAY I WAKE UP AND IT'S A GIFT. IT'S SUCH A SURPRISE. I THINK ABOUT ALL THE
SURPRISES, WHICH ALWAYS MAKE UP THE BEST STORIES IN THE GAMES. I KEEP GOING BACK TO TWO IN PARTICULAR. NOT HERE BUT MANY YEARS AGO. IN SYDNEY, MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT
REMEMBER, BUT HE WAS KNOWN AS
ERIC THE EEL. A GUY WHO COULD BARELY SWIM WAS IN THE POOL BY HIMSELF AND GOT SUCH A ROUSING AND MEMORABLE
ROUND OF APPLAUSE FROM THE AUSTRALIANS WHO LOVE SWIMMING. AND THE OTHER WAS RULON GARDNE
. THAT WAS IN SYDNEY AND HE BEAT ALEXANDER CORRELL AND, WHO WAS LITERALLY UNBEATABLE AT THAT POINT AND HERE CAME THIS
FARMBOY TO BEAT HIM. STUFF LIKE THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS. IT'S GREAT TO SEE SIMONE BILES AND THE U.S. MEN'S BASKETBALL
TEAM. MY FAVORITE MOMENT SO FAR TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DUSH I
HAVE A WAY OF TAKING A LONG TIME TO ANSWER QUESTION -- I
THINK IS THE WAY THE U.S. RUGBY TEAM, THE WOMEN'S TEAM, WHAT A WAY THAT BRONZE MEDAL GAME
ENDED AT THE BUZZER. FIRST TIME THE U.S. WOMEN HAD
EVER WON A MEDAL IN RUGBY AT THE GAMES AND I THOUGHT IT WAS FANTASTIC. >> IT'S ALWAYS THE MOMENTS YOU DON'T SEE COMING THAT MAKE THE
OLYMPICS. PARIS IS DIFFERENT FROM TOKYO. THE CROWD ARE BACK. I WONDER IF
THERE IS A SENSE THE GAMES THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN REINVIGORATED BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO RECONNECT. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE AND WHAT IS THE MOOD LIKE THERE?
>> WELL IT FEELS LIKE OLD TIMES RIGHT NOW AND IT SEEMS LIKE TOKYO AND THE OLYMPICS THAT WE
HAVE HAD TO ENDURE, I WOULD SAY DURING THE PANDEMIC, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE 1 MILLION YEARS AGO.
PARIS IS SUCH AN AMAZING CITY. IT'S JOYOUS. IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN IT IS
ANY OTHER TIME I'VE BEEN HERE. IT'S TRUE TO CHARACTER AND I THINK THIS IS SUCH A PERFECT LOCATION FOR THE GAMES.
IT'S SPECIAL. THERE ARE SOME GREAT PLACES WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE THE OLYMPICS HAVE BEEN AND WHERE THEY ARE GOING. BUT I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY IN CHARACTER FOR PARIS TO HOST
THESE GAMES CONSIDERING WHAT HER MOST RECENT HISTORY WAS.
>> HOW IS IT THAT YOU PREPARE FOR THE GAMES AND THINK THIS WILL BE THE PERFECT JIMMY ROBERTS STORY? THIS IS WHAT I NEED TO COVER?
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S MY DIRTY LITTLE SECRET AND WE WILL KEEP IT BETWEEN US AND NOT TELL ANYBODY BUT I DON'T PREPARE. I WAKE UP EVERY DAY AND I'M
HOPEFUL THAT SOME KIND OF STORY WILL PRESENT ITSELF. AND THERE ARE SO MANY HERE. THERE WAS A MEDALIST YESTERDAY
WHO WON BRONZE, A WOMAN, IN THE BACKSTROKE. SHE WON IT 32 YEARS AFTER HER
FATHER HAD ONE OF THE VERY SAME MEDAL IN THE VERY SAME EVENT FOR MEN.
THINGS LIKE THAT JUST STRIKE ME AND THOSE STORIES ARE ALL OVER THE GAMES. AND AS I SAID BEFORE, IT'S EASY
TO PAY ATTENTION TO SIMONE BILES SHE IS AMAZING. AND AT 27 YEARS OLD, SHE'S NOT
ONLY THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME
BUT THE OLDEST WOMAN TO WIN AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL IN 60 YEARS. THAT IS JUST REMARKABLE. BUT
THOSE STORIES ARE THERE FOR EVERYONE TO CONSUME. KATIE LEDECKY. KATIE LEDECKY HAS NOT LOST OF
THE 1500 METERS, AND A 1500 METER RACE IN THE 14 YEARS.
THAT MEANS SHE IS NOT LOST SINCE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. THE FIRST OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. STUFF LIKE THAT, IT'S JUST
WONDERFUL AND FOR ME THAT'S WHAT SPORTS ARE ABOUT. SURE
IT'S THE NUMBERS. KATIE LEDECKY HAS THE 20 FASTEST TIMES OF ALL TIME IN THAT EVENT. BUT IT'S THE HUMAN STORY.
THERE USED TO BE A LINE ON THE OLD PROGRAM, ABCs WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS, WHICH WAS HOW I BROKE INTO THE INDUSTRY AS A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT WORKING ON
THAT SHOW. AND ONE OF THE OPENING LINES TO THAT SHOW WAS THE HUMAN DRAMA OF ATHLETIC COMPETITION. AND WHILE WE ALL WANT TO SEE THE COMPETITION, I THINK IT'S
THE HUMAN STORIES THAT SO MANY OF US ARE HERE FOR. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE THING THAT ATTRACTED ME TO EXPERIMENT
JIMMY ROBERTS, WE COULD TALK TO
YOU ALL DAY LONG BUT WE WILL LET YOU GO. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. WE APPRECIATED. >> IT'S MY PLEASURE. >> AND YOU CAN CATCH TODAY'S
OLYMPIC EVENTS INCLUDING WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS ALL-AROUND FINALS FEATURING SIMONE BILES ON NBC AND STREAMING ON PEACOCK. >>> IN POLITICS, VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IS RESPONDING TO CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS MADE BY
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT HER RACIAL IDENTITY SAYING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER. MR. TRUMP'S STATEMENTS CAME
DURING A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION AT THE ANNUAL CONVENTION FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BLACK JOURNALISTS, TAKING PLACE IN CHICAGO. HE FALSELY SUGGESTED THE VICE
PRESIDENT DECIDED TO, QUOTE, TURN BLACK, ONLY RECENTLY FOR POLITICAL GAIN.
HERE ARE THE DETAILS AND REACTION.
>> Reporter: FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP FACING FIERCE BACKLASH AFTER FALSELY CLAIMING VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS, WHO WENT TO A HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND IS A MEMBER OF THE BLACK
SORORITY, DID NOT IDENTIFY AS BLACK. >> I DO NOT KNOW SHE WAS BLACK UNTIL A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN SHE HAPPENED TO TURN BLACK AND NOW SHE WANTS TO BE KNOWN
AS BLACK. SO I DON'T KNOW. ISSUED IN DINNER SHE BLACK? I RESPECT OTHER ONE BUT SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T BECAUSE SHE WAS INDIAN ALL THE WAY AND ALL
OF A SUDDEN SHE MADE A TURN AND SHE BECAME A BLACK PERSON.
>> Reporter: THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONDING IN REAL TIME. >> WHAT YOU JUST READ OUT TO ME IS REPULSIVE. IT'S INSULTING. >> Reporter: HERE IS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF INDIAN AND JAMAICAN
IMMIGRANTS EXPERIMENT IT WAS THE SAME OLD SHOW. THE DIVISIVENESS AND THE DISRESPECT. AND LET ME JUST SAY
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER. >> Reporter: THIS UNFOLDED DURING AND OFTEN COMBATIVE INTO THE OTTO BLACK JOURNALISM CONFERENCE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT THERE TO COURT BLACK VOTERS. >> I'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR THE
BLACK POPULATION OF THIS COUNTRY, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT.
INCLUDING OPPORTUNITY ZONES. >> Reporter: BUT LATER WAS PRESSED ABOUT HIS COMMENTS THE RECORD NUMBER OF MIGRANTS HAVE HIT THE BLACK POPULATION HARD
TAKING WHAT HE TERMED BLACK JOBS. >> COMING FROM THE BORDER ARE
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAPPEN TO BE TAKING BLACK JOBS. YOU HAD THE BEST -- >> WHAT EXACTLY IS A BLACK JOB?
>> ANYBODY THAT HAS A JOB. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. >> MR. PRESIDENT --
>> THERE TAKING EMPLOYMENT AWAY FROM BLACK PEOPLE. >> Reporter: THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
IS GOING AGAINST HARRIS ON IMMIGRATION. >> SHANLEY'S THE WORST BORDER CRISIS IN AMERICAN HISTORY ON HER LAW -- WATCH PICK >> Reporter: BUT HARRIS FLIPPING THE SCRIPT.
>> HE TANKED, TANKED THE BIPARTISAN DEAL BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP HIM WIN
AN ELECTION. WHICH GOES TO SHOW DONALD TRUMP
DOES NOT CARE ABOUT BORDER SECURITY. HE ONLY CARES ABOUT HIMSELF. >> THE FORMER PRESIDENT WENT ON
TO BLAST THE QUESTIONS THAT THE EVENT CALLING THEM RUDE AND NASTY.
WE SHOULD NOTE MANY JOURNALISTS ARE APPLAUDING THE MODERATOR SPECIFICALLY, ABCs RACHEL SCOTT, FOR THEIR QUESTIONS AND FOLLOW-UPS. FOR MORE ON THIS LET'S BRING IN OUR CAMPAIGN EMBED, NNAMDI
EGWUONWU. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. YOU WERE THERE. HOURS AFTER THE CONTROVERSIAL REMARKS OF THE CONVENTION, THE
PRESIDENT HELD ITS FIRST CAMPAIGN RALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA SINCE THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AND CONTINUE TO CRITICIZE THE VICE PRESIDENT. LET'S LISTEN TO THAT AND WE WILL TALK ON THE OTHER SIDE.
>> NO MATTER HOW MUCH KAMALA
HARRIS TRIED TO CHANGE HER IMAGE, SHE CANNOT CHANGE THIS FACT. SHE IS THE MOST EXTREME
LIBERAL CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY BY FAR. SHE IS AN EXTREME RADICAL LEFT LUNATIC.
>> LET'S REWIND A LITTLE. YOU WERE THERE AT THE NABJ CONVENTION IN CHICAGO IN THE ROOM.
WHAT WAS THE MOOD LIKE DURING THE PANEL? WHAT WERE SOME OF THE THINGS WE COULD HEAR BUT CANNOT NECESSARILY SEE? >> Reporter: I HAVE TO TELL YO
, COMING INTO THE ROOM AHEAD OF TRUMP'S REMARKS THERE WAS HIGH ANXIETY OVER EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY. MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION WERE VERY SPLIT ABOUT HIM BEING
INVITED TO ATTEND THE CONFERENCE IN THE FIRST PLACE. PEOPLE WERE WALKING ON EGGSHELLS TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD COME AND TAMP HIMSELF
DOWN OR BE THE TYPICAL BRASH DONALD TRUMP WE ARE USED TO AND
IT WAS CLEAR IMMEDIATELY WHEN HE HIT THE STATES THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE THE DONALD TRUMP WE ARE USED TO. AS FAR AS THE RECEPTION OF THE
CROWD, WHEN HE CAME OUT THERE WAS NO APPLAUSE. WHEN HE STARTED IMMEDIATELY ATTACKING RACHEL SCOTT AS BEING HOSTILE AND ASKING THE QUESTIONS THEY WERE GASPS IN
THE ROOM. THERE WERE BOOTHS AT SEVERAL
POINTS INCLUDING WHEN HE REFERENCED VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS'S RACE SUGGESTING THAT SHE HAS ONLY TURNED BLACK IN RECENT YEARS.
AS HE WAS GETTING COMBATIVE, THE AUDIENCE WAS SHOWING THEIR DISPLEASURE WITH HIS REMARKS.
AT A CERTAIN POINT THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN IN THE BACK WHO STARTED SUGGESTING THAT IMMIGRANTS WERE COMING IN TAKING BLACK JOBS WHO ATTEMPTED TO STAND UP AND YELL A QUESTION
AND WAS EVENTUALLY DROWNED OUT. THE AUDIENCE WAS MAKING IT KNOWN EXACTLY HOW THEY FELT ABOUT THOSE COMMENTS IN REAL TIME AND YOU CAN HEAR IT IN
SOME OF THE AUDIO PICK SEVERAL GASPS AND MOMENTS OF EXASPERATION PEOPLE STUNNED AT WHAT THEY WERE HEARING AND THAT CONTINUED THROUGH THE EVENT
WHICH WAS ULTIMATELY CUT SHORT AND ENDED WITH DONALD TRUMP WALKING OFF THE STAGE.
>> YOU MENTIONED THERE WAS A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THEY SHOULD EVEN HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN THE END, WHAT WAS THE FEELING. THE PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED YOU
LIKE THIS WAS IN THE END A GOOD THING FOR THE ORGANIZATION TO DO?
>> Reporter: I HAVE TO BE HONEST. I THINK A LOT OF THE CRITICS OF THIS MOVE FELT VALIDATED BY THE
TIME THE EVENT ENDED. BEFORE TRUMP STARTED SPEAKING HE WAS ON TRUTH SOCIAL ATTACKING A COUPLE HARRIS FOR NOT
ATTENDING AND THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT HE WAS USING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO BLAST HIS OPPONENT.
HAPPY END OF IT, A LOT OF
PEOPLE, SOME SAID THESE MEMBERS GOT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP IN PERSON FOR THE FIRST TIME, SOMETHING THAT SOME JOURNALISTS CAN DO OFTEN BUT OTHERS NEVER
HAD. FOR THE MOST PART, A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT THIS DID MORE HARM TO THE ORGANIZATION THEN
GOOD, ALTHOUGH THE ORGANIZERS WILL TELL YOU THIS IS A LONG PRESIDENT. THEY HAVE INVITED CANDIDATES OF
BOTH PARTIES IN THE PAST BUT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT LIKE MOST OTHER CANDIDATES. >> AS WE HEARD IN THE PEACE,
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS RESPONDED DIRECTLY TO REMARKS DURING A CAMPAIGN STOP LAST NIGHT IN HOUSTON. WHAT ELSE IS SHE SAYING ABOUT THIS CONTROVERSY?
>> Reporter: THE VICE PRESIDENT RESPONDED IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS HER TO KEEP HER POSITIONING AS
BEING MORE POSITIVE ALTERNATIVE TO DONALD TRUMP. SHE TALKS
ABOUT WANTING TO TAKE AMERICA TO A FUTURE WHERE DIVERSITY IS EMBRACED AND IS REPRESENTED OF OUR COALITION OF VOTERS, WHICH
COME FROM ALL COLORS AND BACKGROUNDS SO SHE DID HIT ON
THOSE REMARKS DURING HER EVENT YESTERDAY. SORT OF SUGGESTING DONALD TRUMP IS A LEADER WHO
RESPONDS TO HOSTILITY AND ANGER AND SHE ISN'T.
US INTO WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY. >> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE A LEADER WHO TELLS THE TRUTH. A
LEADER WHO DOES NOT RESPOND WITH HOSTILITY AND ANGER WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THE FACT. WE DESERVE A LEADER WHO
UNDERSTANDS THAT OUR DIFFERENCES DO NOT DIVIDE US.
THEY ARE AN ESSENTIAL SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH. >> Reporter: YEAH.
PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH WHAT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS HAS SAID
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THE WRITER PRESIDENTIAL RUN ALREADY. OFTEN CALLING HIM AS SOMEONE WHO WAS HOSTILE AND RESPONSIVE TO ANGLE AND SAYING THAT IS NOT
WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED WHEN ANY VOTERS ARE CRAVING SOME FORM OF UNITY IN THE COUNTRY.
>> NNAMDI EGWUONWU, TAKE YOU FOR JOINING US . >>> NEARLY 23 YEARS AFTER 9/11,
THREE MEN ACCUSED OF PLOTTING THE ATTACKS INCLUDING THE ALLEGED MASTERMIND, KHALID
SHEIKH MOHAMMED, HAVE AGREED TO A PLEA DEAL WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OFFICIALS SAY THE MEN ARE SCHEDULED TO APPEAR AT A HEARING AT THE MILITARY PRISON AT GUANTANAMO BAY NEXT WEEK.
AS OF NOW DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT REMAIN UNCLEAR BUT
THE DEFENDANTS ARE EXPECTED TO PLEAD GUILTY TO LESSER CHARGES THAT COULD SPARE THEM THE DEATH PENALTY. THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT SAID THE THREE SUSPECTS WERE INITIALLY
CHARGED IN 22,008 WITH WAR CRIMES OR ONE OF THEIR ALLEGED ROLES IN THE ATTACK THE CLAIMED NEARLY 3000 LIVES. THE MEN ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE
SENTENCED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. >>> HUNDREDS GATHERED IN TEHRAN
TODAY FOR THE FUNERAL OF TOP HAMAS LEADER, ISMAIL HANIYEH .
HAMAS AND IRAN ARE ACCUSING ISRAEL OF ASSASSINATING ISMAIL HANIYEH BUT IT'S REALLY OFFICIALS HAVE NOT COMMENTED ON THE ATTACK . HE WAS A TOP POLITICAL LEADER AND ONE OF THE
KEY HAMAS NEGOTIATORS FOR A POTENTIAL CEASE-FIRE DEAL AND DOES APPEAR GLOBAL LEADERS ARE
NOT CONCERNED ANY DEAL COULD BE OUT OF REACH. OUR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT
IS LIVE IN BEIRUT WITH THE LATEST GOOD MORNING. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE SERVICE TODAY AND WHAT
YOU'RE RUNNING OFFICIAL SAYING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF RETALIATION? >> Reporter: MORE THAN ONE
SERVICE IN BEIRUT FOR THAT
HEZBOLLAH LEADER KILLED TWO DAYS AGO. WHAT WE SEE NOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST ARE TWIN ASSASSINATIONS AND TWIN FUNERALS TWO DAYS LATER. VERY DESTABILIZING MATRIX OF
DIFFERENT FORCES PROTESTING AGAINST THE ISRAELIS THEY ACCUSED OF COMMITTING BOTH.
THE ISRAELIS HAVE ONLY COPPED 21. THE ONE IN BEIRUT AND THAT HEZBOLLAH LEADER, BUT THE ONE IN NEURON, THAT IS A HAMAS
LEADER AND ONE MUCH WANTED BY THE ISRAELIS SO NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE ALL OF THESE
ARE NON-BACK GROUPS BE IT HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON OR HAMAS IN THE GAZA STRIP, THE HOUTHI
AND YEMEN ARE COALESCING EVEN MORE THAN THEY WERE BEFORE AROUND FIGHTING THE ISRAELIS. WHEN I SAY THESE ARE NON-BACK GROUPS, THE AXIS OF RESISTANCE YOU HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE OCTOBER 7 BEEN ACTING IN CONCERT. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THE ISRAELIS SEEM TO BE ATTACKING
THEM IN CONCERT, AS WELL, THE
REAL WORRY IS THESE FINGERS OF THE IRANIAN REGIME SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REGION WILL CLOSE INTO A FIST AND THAT
WILL CREATE A MAJOR PROBLEM NOT JUST FOR THE ISRAELIS BUT FOR THE AMERICANS AND THEIR ALLIES. >> WE KNOW CEASE-FIRE
NEGOTIATIONS AT A STANDSTILL. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT THI
? >> Reporter: IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE PESSIMISTIC. A COUPLE DAYS AGO THEY SAID THE IDEA OF AN ALL-OUT WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST WAS NOT INEVITABLE
AND UNLIKELY. TWO DAYS LATER THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND IT WAS A WEEK AGO THEY SAID THERE WAS OPTIMISM AROUND THE DEAL BUT I HAVE TO
TELL YOU THESE ASSASSINATIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE ONES THAT WILL BE UNDERMINING THE NEGOTIATIONS IN ANY REAL WAY BECAUSE THESE NEGOTIATIONS WERE ALREADY UNDERMINED. THEY DO NOT
NEED THE HELP OF THE ISRAELIS TO ASSASSINATE THE LEADERS. IT'S BEEN 10 MONTHS OF NEGOTIATING PICK THE LAST SUCCESSFUL ONE WAS IN NOVEMBER
AND WE HAVE BEEN HEARING BURSTS OF OPTIMISM TIME AND AGAIN THAT
HAVE BEEN TAKEN DOWN BY THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION WHICH IS BOTH SIDES, HAMAS AND ISRAEL CANNOT COME TO AGREEMENT ON THE ONE MAIN ISSUE, WHICH IS THE
TIMELINE FOR THE IS REALLY FULL WITHDRAWAL FROM THE GAZA STRIP. THESE ASSASSINATIONS HAVE FRUSTRATED THE NEGOTIATIONS, BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THOSE NEGOTIATIONS DID NOT NEED HELP
FROM THE ISRAELIS OR THESE ASSASSINATIONS TO BE MORE LIBERAL THAN THEY HAVE BEEN FOR
MONTHS. >>> LET'S TURN FOR THE MORNING
NEWS NOW FORECAST WITH SCATTERED STORMS ACROSS THE EAST AND THE HEAT MAKING HEADLINES. ANGIE LASSMAN IS HERE WITH THE FORECAST.
>> GOOD MORNING.
WE HAVE RAIN AND WARM TEMPERATURES. LET'S START WITH THE RAIN THAT WILL PROGRESS INTO THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS BY TODAY. A LOT OF US ARE WAKING UP TO
WET WEATHER. MOST OF THAT RAIN FOCUSED ACROSS PARTS OF ILLINOIS BUT
WE'VE SEEN IT ACROSS A CHUNK OF THE AREA OVER THE MORNING SO WE COULD RUN INTO WET ROADS IN
PLACES LIKE KANSAS CITY OR ST. LOUIS, CEDAR RAPIDS ALSO DEALING WITH RAIN AND THAT STRETCHES INTO PORTIONS OF THE UPPER MIDWEST MINNEAPOLIS IS DRY BUT SHOWERS ARE IN THE
VICINITY PRACTICE WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH THE DAY AND AS WE
GET TEMPERATURES RIPPING UP WE SEE PLENTY OF INSTABILITY AND WARMTH FOR THOSE THUNDERSTORMS TO SPARK STRONGER AND MORE IMPACTFUL. 29 MILLION PEOPLE
AT RISK. THE MAIN THING WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR WIND GUSTS. LIKE YESTERDAY WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR GUSTS OVER 60 MILES PER HOUR . NOT AS STRONG
AS YESTERDAY BUT STILL HAIL OR ISOLATED TORNADO ON THE TABLE. TAKE NOTE OF THE CITIES INCLUDED, ST. LOUIS,
INDIANAPOLIS AND EVANSVILLE HAVE THE POTENTIAL. THIS SYSTEM IS ON THE MOVE THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. TODAY IT'S THE SEVERE RISK AND HEAVY RAIN WE WILL TRACK FOR
TOMORROW WE KEEP SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE PICTURE FOR A GOOD AREA TO THE EAST. THE MID-ATLANTIC INTO THE NORTHEAST AND PARTS OF THE MIDWEST AND GREAT LAKES. WE WILL SEE GUSTY WIND AND
HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE. TODAY THAT HEAVY RAIN WILL BE IMPRESSIVE FROM MADISON, CHICAGO, INDIANAPOLIS,
CINCINNATI AND INTO PARTS OF KENTUCKY. WE COULD SEE FLASH FLOODING CONCERN. THE RANGE IS FROM AN INCH TO
TWO INCHES WITH HIGHER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE SO BE MINDFUL OF THAT. WE STILL HAVE THOSE WILDFIRES OUT WEST AND THE SMOKE IS ON
THE MOVE AND CAUSING PROBLEMS SPECIFICALLY WITH AIR QUALITY. WE HAVE UNHEALTHY GROUPS DEALING WITH THAT ACROSS A GOOD
AREA OF THE COUNTRY, BUT NOTICED DENVER IS DEALING WITH
UNHEALTHY CONDITIONS FOR SMOKE AND OZONE SAYS SOMETHING FOR FOLKS TO NOTE THERE. >> THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP.
STAYING PUT. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HOLDS STEADY ON INTEREST RATES BUT SIGNALS ARE S. NUMERALS NOT COMG TO CAP CREDIT CARD LATE FEES.
>> TALKING TUITION IS NEW CLASS OF FRESHMEN GET READY TO GO TO COLLEGE. >> YOU THINK THIS COULD IMPACT HOW PEOPLE VOTE? >> MORNING NEWS NOW STREAMING
WEEKDAYS AT 7:00 EXTRACT DESPITE SIGNS OF A SLOWING ECONOMY AND THE WERE A PATIENT THE INTEREST RATES WILL STAY
WHERE THEY ARE FOR NOW. THE BENCHMARK RATE CONTINUES TO HOVER AROUND 5.5% SINCE THE FED
STOPPED INCREMENTAL HIKES ONE YEAR AGO TO CURB INFLATION BUT THE FED DID LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR RATE CUT IN THE NOT-TOO-
DISTANT FUTURE POINTING TO DATA THAT SHOWS THE SOFTENING JOBS MARKET.
CALEB SILVER IS HERE TO EXPLAIN ALL OF IT. NO SURPRISE. WHEN WE SPOKE
YESTERDAY YOU SAID A 3% CHANCE THEY WOULD'VE CUT INTEREST RATES YESTERDAY. EXPLAIN WHAT JEROME POWELL HAD TO SAY AND WHY THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING? >> LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF THE
FED USES IN THE STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY CHANGE FROM MEETING TO MEETING AND WHAT CHANGED WAS IN JUNE THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SOMEWHAT ELEVATED ASPECTS OF INFLATION. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MODEST
PROGRESS ON INFLATION SO THE FED IS ACKNOWLEDGING INFLATION HAS COME DOWN, AND IT HAS. BUT THE FED IS TWO JOBS. IT'S INFLATION. KEEP THAT COOL AROUND 2.5% IN
THE LABOR MARKET. THE FED AND POWELL ACKNOWLEDGE THE LABOR MARKET IS SOFTENING. WE WILL GET A JOBS REPORT TOMORROW FOR THE MONTH OF JULY AND WE EXPECT 175,000 JOBS
ADDED BUT WATCH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WHICH IS AT 4.1%. AS THAT CREEPS HIGHER THE FED GETS WORRIED ABOUT JOB LOSSES AND THEY MAY NEED TO TRIGGER A
RATE CUT SOONER. >> THE HIRING RATE HAS SLOWED TO A LEVEL WE HAVEN'T SEEN SINCE 2014. SHOULD WE WORRY ABOUT THAT? >> WE HAVE DONE SO MUCH
AGGRESSIVE HIRING THE LAST FEW YEARS BECAUSE OF DEMAND COMING BACK AFTER THE PANDEMIC THAT COMPANIES MAY HAVE OVERSTEPPED AND WAGES WENT UP. THE FED WATCHES THIS. WAGE INFLATION IS PART OF
INFLATION. COMPANIES HAVE TO PLAY PULLEYS MORE AND SO THEY CHARGE THE CUSTOMER MORE. THEY WANT TO KEEP THOSE THINGS
IN CHECK. WAGE INFLATION NEEDS TO COOL AND HIRING NEEDS TO COOL. WE WANT TO NORMALIZATION. WE
ARE GETTING THERE IN THE FED CHAIRS THAT WERE GETTING THERE IN SEPTEMBER AND I COULD FEEL LIKE THE RIGHT TIME TO CUT? >> WHEN INTEREST RATES WENT UP
IT WASN'T ALL AT ONCE. IT WAS LITTLE BY LITTLE AND THAT'S HOW IT WILL WORK THE OTHER WAY. TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE MAY NOT SEE A DRAMATIC
DIFFERENCE RIGHT AWAY. >> WERE NOT GOING DOWN TO 2% 3%
ANYTIME SOON. QUARTER-POINT CUTS TO MODERATE THE ECONOMY. THINK OF IT AS A HOT AIR BALLOON. CUT A BIT AND LET IT COOL DOWN. THAT'S WHAT THEY WILL DO.
MAYBE A QUARTER-POINT CUT AT THE SEPTEMBER MEETING.
AND THEN MAYBE ONE MORE AT THE NOVEMBER MEETING BUT THAT COMES CLOSE TO THE ELECTION SO WE
WILL SEE IF THAT HAPPENS. >> DO YOU HAVE THE COUNTDOWN FOR THAT ONE? >> ONE MEETING AT A TIME.
THANK YOU. >>> LET'S GET TO INTERNATIONAL HEADLINES. THE LATEST ELLA
VENEZUELA FOLLOWING A DISPUTED ELECTION RESULT. OUR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT
CLAUDIO LAVANGA HAS THAT AND OTHER NEWS FROM AROUND THE WORLD.
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. VENEZUELA NICOLAS MADURO HAS ASKED THE SUPREME COURT OF VENEZUELA TO AUDIT THE ELECTION RESULTS.
THIS IS THE FIRST CONCESSION HE IS MADE TO DEMANDS FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY BUT THERE ARE
STILL WIDESPREAD DOUBTS ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE AUDITS BECAUSE OF HOW CLOSELY THE COURT IS ALIGNED ITH THE MADURO GOVERNMENT.
OFFICIALS SAY MORE THAN 1000 PEOPLE BEEN ARRESTED SO FAR AND OPPOSITION PROTESTS CONTINUE BRINGING THE COUNTRY TO A STANDSTILL.
LET'S GO TO UKRAINE WHERE THE FIRST F-16 FIGHTER JETS HAVE ARRIVED. NATO MEMBERS, BELGIUM, DENMARK,
THE NETHERLANDS AND NORWAY HAVE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING UKRAINE WITH MORE THAN 60 OTHER PLANES OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND ACCORDING TO A UKRAINIAN LAWMAKER, THE FIRST FEW HAVE
ARRIVED. THE DELIVERY WAS CONFIRMED BY A U.S. OFFICIAL WHO SPOKE ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY TO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. AND LET'S GO TO SOUTH KOREA
WHERE KOREAN AIR ANNOUNCED FROM AUGUST 15 INSTANT NOODLES WILL NO LONGER BE ON THE MENU IN
ECONOMY. THE AIRLINE CARRIER SAID THE INCREASED RISK OF TURBULENCE COULD POSE BURN RISK.
NOODLES, THEY SAY, WOULD BE REPLACED BY SANDWICHES, CORN DOGS AND PIZZA SPARKING INSTANT CRITICISM ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR SOME POINTED OUT THAT HOT FOOD CAN CAUSE BURNS.
EITHER WAY, FOR ONCE, ECONOMY CLASS PASSENGERS CAN CLAIM THEY ARE ON HOT SEATS. >> THAT IS THE TURBULENT SIDE
EFFECT I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF. THANK YOU. >>> WHY ONE WOMAN'S POTENTIALLY
LIFE-CHANGING RESEARCH IS BEING RECOGNIZED BY FORBES 50 OVER 50. WE WILL SPEAK WITH DR. STACY LINDAU ABOUT A IN THE NOW.
NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW.
>>> WELCOME BACK. FORBES IS JUST OUT WITH ITS THIRD ANNUAL 50 OVER 50 LIST THIS MORNING AND HIGHLIGHTS THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF WOMEN OVER THE AGE OF 50 WHO ARE CHANGING THE
WORLD. FROM GROUNDBREAKING INNOVATION TO LIFE-CHANGING RESEARCH, THE WOMEN PROVE SOME OF OUR BEST YEARS ARE STILL AHEAD OF US AND WE HAVE ONE OF THOSE WOMEN FEATURED WITH US THIS MORNING.
DR. STACY LINDAU IS SPEARHEADING CUTTING EDGE WORK THAT CAN HELP LIMIT BETTER RECOVERY FROM MASTECTOMIES AND RECONSTRUCTIVE BREAST SURGERY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
YOU RECENTLY RECEIVED A NEARLY $4 MILLION GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH TO BEGIN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR WHAT IS CALLED THE BIONIC BREASTS PROJECT. TELL US ABOUT THE PROJECT AND
HOW IT HELPS WOMEN WHO'VE HAD A MASTECTOMY. >> GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS.
BIONIC BEST PROJECT SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE AIMS TO RESTORE
SENSATION TO WOMEN'S BREASTS AFTER MASTECTOMY. MANY WOMEN 50 TO 75% AND SOME STUDIES, LOSE ALL OR MOST
SENSATION THEIR BREASTS. ALTHOUGH WE DO A BEAUTIFUL JOB OF RECONSTRUCTING THE APPEARANCE OF THE BREAST, THERE'S BEEN LESS ATTENTION TO RESTORING THE FUNCTION OF THE
BREAST. THE SENSATION THE CRITICAL
FUNCTION FOR HUGGING AND SAFETY SO THE PERSON DOESN'T GET A BURN OR INJURY, AND SEXUAL
FUNCTION. >> LET'S LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE
YOU SAID THE PROJECT ADDRESSES A GAP AND WOMEN'S QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. TALK ABOUT WHAT WOMEN ARE EXPERIENCING WHEN AND AFTER THEY UNDERGO THIS KIND OF
TREATMENT ARE THEY ALWAYS FULLY AWARE OF THE POSSIBLE
CONSEQUENCES BEFORE OPTING FOR THIS SURGERY?
>> IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE AS MANY AS 100,000 WOMEN HAVE ONE OR BOTH BREASTS REMOVED EVERY YEAR TO TREAT OR PREVENT BREAST CANCER AND WORLDWIDE THERE ARE MILLIONS WHO'VE HAD
THIS PROCEDURE. MANY WOMEN LIKE IN A MASTECTOMY TO AN
IMPUTATION LIKE THE LOSS OF A LIMB. AND LIKE I SAID, WHILE WE ARE
RESTORING THE APPEARANCE OF THE BREAST -- ONE OF MY PATIENTS SAID THEY LOOK GREAT AND A SWEATER BUT THEY ARE DEAD TO ME. WE ARE RESTORING APPEARANCE,
WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN AND PEOPLE WHO LOVE WOMEN, BUT THE FUNCTION IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WOMEN OFTEN TIMES ARE FOCUSED ON THE CANCER TREATMENT. THEY
WANT TO GET RID OF THE CANCER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THE SURGEON MAY SAY WE HAD TO REMOVE THE NERVES AND HE WILL HAVE SENSATION. IT'S HARD TO HEAR THOSE WORDS
BEFORE THE SURGERY. BUT MANY WOMEN SAY AFTER
SURGERY THEY REALLY MOURN THE LOSS OF SENSATION. THEY CAN'T FEEL A HOG. YOU CAN'T FEEL THE SEXUAL PLEASURE THAT COMES WITH BREAST STIMULATION DURING AND IT CAN
BE VERY DISTRESSING TO KNOW THAT A PARTNER IS ENJOYING THEIR BREASTS SEXUALLY BUT THEY
CAN'T FEEL THEM. THIS IS A PROBLEM CALLED DISEMBODIMENT. AND OF COURSE BREASTS ARE IMPORTANT FOR BALANCE AND KNOWING WHERE A PERSON IS IN
SPACE AND LOSS OF SENSATION INTERFERES WITH THOSE FUNCTION . OUR HOPE IS TO RESTORE THESE FUNCTIONS WITH THE BIONIC
BREASTS PROJECT. >> YOU DO THIS WORK TO HELP
OTHER PEOPLE BUT FOR YOU PERSONALLY, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE INCLUDED ON THIS LIST? >> IT'S TREMENDOUS. SCIENCE CAN
BE A SLOW PROGRESS. IT'S FUN AND STIMULATING BUT IT CAN BE SLOW. THIS RECOGNITION FIRST AND FOREMOST IS TO THESE MILLIONS
OF WOMEN WORLDWIDE WE SEE YOU AND HEAR YOUR. FORBES RECOGNIZES THIS PROBLEM OF LOSS OF SENSATION AND BREAST
FUNCTION AFTER DOMESTIC TO ME TO BE A PROBLEM WORTHY OF
SOLVING AND WORTHY OF ATTENTION SO I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT. AND IT SAYS TO MY TEAM -- I'M THE ONLY ONE OVER 50 ON MY TEAM
IT SAYS TO THEM THE HARD WORK AND THE LONG NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR WOMEN IS WORTHWHILE. AND
LASTLY FOR YOUNGER WOMEN, RECOGNIZING THAT LIFE KEEPS
HAPPENING AFTER 50, THAT ADULTS AND CRONUTS IN OUR SOCIETY HAD GREAT IDEAS AND ARE CONTRIBUTING GOOD TO THE WORLD IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT WE
ARE SEEING IS A LOT OF BAD BEHAVIOR BY GROWN-UPS THAT GET SPOTLIGHTED AND YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THAT GROWN-UPS ARE DOING GOOD FOR THE WORLD AND
THEY NEED TO FEEL INSPIRED AND HOPEFUL ABOUT THEIR FUTURE FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS. >> HIGHLIGHT THE GOOD BEHAVIOR. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO AND FOR JOINING US THIS
MORNING. >> I'M SO GRATEFUL. 50 FOR YOUR WORK. >>> IT'S WASN'T QUITE WHAT THEY MAY HAVE HOPED FOR AND THE ALL OF THE COMPETITION. THE USA MEN'S GYMNASTICS TEAM

THIS HAS BEEN A ROLLER COASTER WEEK. IT HASN'T BEEN A WEEK SINCE THE OPENING CEREMONY. ROGER, I WAS WITH YOU.
WHAT IS THIS EXPERIENCE BEEN LIKE FOR YOU? >> THIS IS BEEN A DREAM OF MY LIFE.
YOU WATCH THE OLYMPICS AND PREPARE AND SAY HOPEFULLY I'M HERE. NOW WE ARE HERE.
WE HAVE A MEDAL THAT WE'VE NOT SEEN ON THE MAIN SITE IN A LONG TIME ENJOYING THE JOURNEY.
>> WE KNOW MAKING IT TO THE OLYMPICS IS NOT EASY. THE COMPETITION IS FIERCE. WALK US THROUGH YOUR PERFORMANCE YESTERDAY AND WHAT ARE YOU TAKING AWAY FROM THIS
EXPERIENCE? >> YEAH. I'M SO PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS HISTORIC TEAM, LIKE FRED SAID.
IT'S BEEN 16 YEARS SINCE THE LAST OLYMPIC MEDAL. AND MAKING THE OLYMPIC TEAM IS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT ITSELF. BUT FRED PUSHES ME TO DO THE
COLOR THING AND BRINGING BACK ONE OF THESE IS DEFINITELY THE COOLER THING IN THIS REGARD. IT'S BEEN AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE AND I WILL REMEMBER IT FOR A
LIFETIME.
LOTS OF THINGS TO LEARN AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE REST OF THE EXPERIENCE TO COME. >> FREDERICK, YOU ARE HUGE ON THE MAT AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND
FOR MANY KIDS OF COLOR, YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION. TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU? I'M GUESSING WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER YOU DO NOT SEE MANY PEOPLE WHO LOOKED LIKE YOU
COMPETING IN GYMNASTICS. NOW YOUNGER KIDS SEE YOU AND THEY ARE SO INCREDIBLY INSPIRED. >> YEAH. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE IN THIS POSITION WHEN I WAS GROWING UP
THERE WERE A LOT OF TIMES WHERE I WAS THE ONLY BLACK KID TRAINING IN THE GYM. I DO NOT GET TO LOOK UP TO SOMEONE AT THE OLYMPIC LEVEL
AND NOW I CAN SHOW THIS SPORT IS FUN AND MADE FOR ALL OF US. YOU CAN LIVE YOUR DREAMS OUT DOING THIS SPORT.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO SHOW WHILE I'M HERE AND I'M BLESSED.
>> YOU GUYS ALL HAD TO COMPETE ANYMORE. WE STICK AROUND PARIS?
THERE ARE CERTAINLY WORSE PLACES TO BE. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE REST OF THE OLYMPICS? >> YEAH. THE NUMBER ONE THING I WANT TO DO IS CHEER ON MY TEAMMATES. HE
IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MEDAL IF HE DOES HIS JOB AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE WOMEN'S ALL-AROUND COMPETITION TONIGHT AND I WOULD BE LYING IF

>> A COUPLE PEOPLE LOOKING FORWARD TO WATCHING.

I'M GOING TO SOME OF THE BOXING COMPETITIONS. AND TRAIN WITH OTHER ATHLETES
HEAR AND LEARN DIFFERENT THINGS FROM DIFFERENT SPORTS. >> ALWAYS LEARNING. I LOVE THAT.
YOU MENTIONED THE POMMEL HORSE ONE COMPETITION THE MEN HAVE LEFT.
STEPHEN NEDOROSCIK, WHO I THINK IS CAPTIVATED SO MANY PEOPLE THE LAST WEEK WITH HIS SPECIALTY. TALK ABOUT HOW COOL IT IS TO WITNESS HIS STORY IN THE FACT
THAT HE STILL HAS ONE MORE EVENT. >> I WOULD SAY, I CAN NEVER IMAGINE GOING LAST AFTER HAVING
17 ROUTINES BEHIND YOU AND THAT'S THE ONLY ROUTINE YOU ARE COMPETING AND YOU'RE SITTING AROUND ALL DAY WAITING TO GO TO YOUR EVENT. AND YOU KNOW IF I HIT MY
ROUTINE I GUARANTEE TEAM USA A MEDAL. THE WEIGHT OF THE ROAD WAS ON HIS SHOULDERS BUT WE TRIED OUR BEST TO ALLEVIATE THAT STRESS
AND GIVE HIM THE ABILITY TO KNOW HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE OUT THERE.
HE HAS ALL OF USA BEHIND HIM AND HIS TEAMMATES AND BROTHER SUPPORTING HIM IN THAT MOMENT IF YOU WATCH THEM GO OUT AND CRUSH IT, I MEAN, I'M SO PROUD
TO SEE HIM GOING VIRAL. HE DESERVES IT. THE POMMEL SPECIALIST IS SOMETHING MANY PEOPLE MAY HAVE THOUGHT WAS A UNIQUE ADDITION TO OUR TEAM AND I'M GLAD TO SEE
IT WORKED AND THAT HE SUCCEEDED IN THAT ROLE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO HIS PERFORMANCE AGAIN
. >> FREDERICK, THIS IS THE MOST UNFAIR QUESTION WE ASK ANYONE, ESPECIALLY WITH SO MUCH TIME LEFT IN PARIS BUT DOES THIS MAKE YOU GUYS THINK ALREADY
ABOUT L.A. AND HAVING THE OLYMPICS IN THE UNITED STATES? IS THAT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?
>> 100%. AT THIS LAST COMPETITION THE CROWD WAS CHANTING USA THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COMPETITION BUT I KNOW IT WILL BE NOTHING COMPARED TO L.A. IT WILL BE THE EVENT AND TALKED
ABOUT FOR YEARS AFTER AND LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING
SOMETHING CRAZY THEN. >> ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THAT TOO? >> I'M GOING TO TAKE THE ADVICE
OF ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS HERE FOR MICHIGAN REPRESENTING SYRIA, HE SAYS, YOU CAN'T MAKE
A FOUR YEAR DECISION RIGHT NOW. TAKING IT ONE DAY AT A TIME. FINISHING ONE MICHIGAN AND MY MASTERS PROGRAM IN ACCOUNTING AND THEN FRED AND I HAVE ONE
MORE JOB TO DO IN ANN ARBOR AND THAT'S TO BRING HOME THE TROPHY FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. THAT IS PRIORITY NUMBER ONE AND GETTING HOME SAFELY?
>> YOU WILL BE COMING BACK TO
AMERICA SOON. CHICAGO AREA AND BOSTON AREA. WHAT WILL IT BE LIKE WHEN YOU COME BACK AND HOW WILL YOU CELEBRATE? >> I MEAN, I HEARD THEY ARE
THROWING A PARADE WHERE I'M FROM. THAT WILL BE CRAZY TO SEE.
I JUST WANT TO ELAX TO CLEAR THE SCHEDULE AND HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS AND JUST ENJOY BEING HOME. >> AND REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MY COACHES.
THEY WERE MY ROLE MODELS AND FATHER FIGURES IN MY LIFE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. IT'S GOING TO BE AWESOME. THEY ARE TEXTING ME AND PRESENT
MY PARENTS ARE HERE. USUALLY I GO TO CHICAGO TO SEE MY DAD BUT I'M EXCITED TO GO HOME AND SEE MY COACHES AND MY BEST FRIEND FROM HOME.
>> DID YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD HAVE A PARADE IN YOUR HONOR? >> NO. I DID NOT.
AND IT'S FUNNY SEEING ALL THE TEACHERS SENDING VIDEOS WISHING ME LUCK BECAUSE I REMEMBER ALL THOSE CLASSES WHERE I'M SITTING THERE BORED AND I'M THINKING, I
CAN'T WAIT TO GO TO THE GYM BUT I HAVE TO GET MY HOMEWORK DONE RIGHT NOW. NOW THE TEACHERS ARE
SAYING IT WAS WORTH KEEPING
YOUR MIND ON GYMNASTICS. >> ABSOLUTELY. ENJOY THE PARADE.
NO HOMEWORK NEEDED. FREDERICK RICHARD AND PAUL JUDA, YOU HAVE DONE US PROUD AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE GIVEN US THIS PAST WEEK

VERY EXCITED WITH THE WIN. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT. YOU SAID SHE BROKE THE OLYMPIC RECORD THAT SHE SET IN TOKYO
FOUR YEARS AGO. SO SHE IS FOUR YEARS OLDER AND FIVE SECONDS FASTER IN THIS
EVENT. THAT IS AMAZING TO THINK ABOUT THE DEDICATION, THE TRAINING
INVOLVED HERE AND SHE THANKED THE CREW IN FLORIDA. A LOT OF TIMES SHE IS TRAINING WITH MEN WHO ARE PUSHING HER, SHE SAYS, TO BE BETTER AND SHE
THANKED ALL OF THEM LAST NIGHT BUT THE CLOSEST COMPETITOR WAS 10 SECONDS BEHIND IN SWIMMING.
THAT'S A LIFETIME. SHE GOT TO THE WALL, TOUCHED, AND AT TIMES LOOKED AROUND AND SURVEYED EVERYTHING BEFORE THE NEXT COMPETITOR CAME IN. IT WAS NEAT TO SEE THAT.
THE ONLY AMERICAN WITH MORE MEDALS AT THE OLYMPICS ARE MICHAEL PHELPS AND MARK SPITZ.
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE A BIT YOUNGER, LOOK IT UP ON THE PHONE. MARK SPITZ WAS QUITE A SWIMMER. >> WHEN I CAME INTO WORK THIS
MORNING THE TEAM USA MEDAL COUNT WAS AT 30 AND AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR WE SAW THE NUMBER INCREASE ALREADY TO 31. YOU BLINK AND THE NUMBER GOES

SHE WINS THE SILVER IN THE 100 METER FREE WITH A STRONG RACE THERE. YOU HAVE EVY LIEBFARTH , SHE AND CANOE SLALOM WHEN THE FIRST
U.S. MEDAL EVER IN THAT SPORT. SHE GRABBED THE BRONZE PICK SHE HAD A TERRIBLE QUALIFYING ROUND
AND WAS THE LAST COMPETITOR TO MAKE THE FIELD FOR THE MEDAL ROUND. THAT MEANT SHE HAD TO GO FIRST
SHE GATHERED HERSELF AND WENT OUT THERE AND POSTED A SCORE THAT STOOD UP THROUGH THE REST OF THE COMPETITION. SHE TAKES ON THE BRONZE. AND THEN YOU HAVE PARIS PENDING
AS SHE WINS THE BRONZE AND BMX
FREESTYLE AND SHE WAS ON FIRE PICK SHE HAD A TERRIFIC RUN THAT SHE CAME INTO THIS NOT KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT AND NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT A MEDEVAC
GIRL THAT PICK SHE JUST WHEN HER BEST RUN AND DID IT AT THE MOST IMPORTANT TIME.

RAFF SANCHEZ HAS THE LATEST FROM TEL AVIV. >> Reporter: ISRAELI FORCES ARE ON HIGH ALERT AFTER
SIMULTANEOUS THREATS FROM IRAN, HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH.
THOSE COME AFTER THE KILLING OF TWO HIGH PROFILE MILITANTS. ONE IN LEBANON AND THE OTHER ONE IN IRAN.
THIS MORNING IRAN STAGING A MASS FUNERAL FOR THE POLITICAL CHIEF.
THE IRANIAN REGIME SAYS ISMAIL HANIYEH WAS ASSASSINATED BY ISRAEL. KILLED BY A MISSILE STRIKE ON THIS BUILDING IN THE HEART OF
ITS CAPITAL CITY. PRAYERS LED BY THE IRAN SUPREME
LEADER WHO MET ISMAIL HANIYEH HOURS BEFORE HIS DEATH. CALLS OF MOURNING MIXING WITH CRIES FOR REVENGE TO ISRAEL AND DEATH TO AMERICA.
WITH FEARS OF A WIDER WAR RISING, THE NEW YORK TIMES CITING THREE IRANIAN OFFICIALS
REPORTS THE SUPREME LEADER HAS ORDERED A DIRECT ATTACK ON ISRAEL. A POTENTIAL REPEAT OF THIS
MASSIVE MISSILE BRUSH IRAN FIRED BACK IN APRIL. HAS BELOW, IRAN'S PROXIES IN LEBANON ALSO THREATENING TO
ATTACK AFTER ISRAELI STRIKE THAT KILLED ONE OF THEIR TOP COMMANDERS. ISRAELIS PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WARNING

PALESTINIAN TURN LISTING A PAINFUL GOODBYE TO TWO OF THEIR
OWN SAYING THIS GROUP WAS KILLED WHEN ISRAELI FORCES BOMBED THEIR CAR WHILE THEY WERE COVERING THE ATTACK.
ISRAEL'S MILITARY DID NOT RESPOND TO OUR REQUEST FOR COMMENTS ABOUT THE KILLING OF THOSE TWO JOURNALISTS. THEY ARE SAYING THEY ARE NOW CONFIDENT THEY TOOK OUT THE
MILITARY CHIEF IN A STRIKE IN GAZA TWO WEEKS AGO WHERE IT ALSO KILLED DOZENS OF CIVILIANS.
THAT TEAR CHIEF WAS HIDING IN A CIVILIAN AREA. >> THANK YOU. LET'S BRING IN OUR RETIRED
LIEUTENANT GENERAL WHO'S A ANALYST AND FORMER DEPUTY
COMMAND -- COMMANDER. ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH
US. ISRAEL MILITARY CLAIMING IT KILLED ANOTHER TOP HAMAS OFFICIAL BACK IN MID JULY. HAMAS IS NOT CONFIRMED THAT ARE HAS COMMENTED ON IT.
THIS ADDS TO ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS. HOW GREAT IS THE RISK OF A
WIDER REGIONAL WAR ? >> THE RISK AND GOOD TO BE WITH
YOU. THE RISK IS EXTREMELY HIGH. WHEN YOU PUT THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE GAZA STRIP, THE PERSON THAT THE
ISRAELIS KILLED WAS A SIGNIFICANT LEADER IN GAZA. HE WAS THE LEADER OF THE
MILITARY GROUND FORCES THAT THE ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN ATTACKING. HE CAME TO POWER IN 2002. HE WAS THE MASTERMIND OF THE
OCTOBER 7th ATTACKS.
HAMAS WILL WANT TO RETALIATE FOR THAT PARTICULAR DEATH. WHEN WE GO TO HEZBOLLAH AND TAKE A LOOK AT FOOD SECURITY,
ANOTHER SENIOR LEADER IN HEZBOLLAH MASTERMIND THE 1983
BEIRUT ATTACK ON U.S. MARINE FORCES AND MASTERMIND THE
SOCCER FIELD ATTACK THAT OCCURRED LAST SATURDAY. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. ISMAIL HANIYEH WHO WAS KILLED
ON A RAINY AND SOIL INTO RON.
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT THERE. WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER, YOU SEE THE REGION SIMMERING AND
WHAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO DO IS HAVE IT BOIL OVER. IF RETALIATION OCCURS, THAT
SPELLS INGREDIENTS FOR BOILING
OVER. >> THE WORRY IS THERE WILL BE RETALIATION. WHAT MAY THAT LOOK LIKE ? >> WHAT YOU WILL FIND THIS CAN BE MEASURED AND CALCULATED BY
IRAN. IRAN DOES NOT WANT WAR WITH
ISRAEL. I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE A LOSING PROPOSITION IF THEY ATTEMPT TO GO TO WAR WITH ISRAEL. HAS BELOW WILL PARTICIPATE THIS
TIME BECAUSE I GO BACK TO THE LEADER THAT WAS KILLED THERE. I THINK YOU WILL SEE SOMETHING
LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN APRIL WITH A ARE ATTACK WITH MISSILES
AND DRONES IN TEL AVIV. I DON'T SEE THEM GOING TO WEST JERUSALEM WHERE THE ISRAELIS
HAVE CLAIMED POWER. I DO SEE THEM HITTING MOSTLY THE POPULATED AREAS AROUND TEL
AVIV. >> ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR ANALYSIS. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. >> THANK YOU.

A NEW WARNING OVER MELTING ICE IN THE ARCTIC. THE IMPACT THAT CLIMATE EXPERTS SAY IT COULD HAVE AROUND THE WORLD. >>> CRUISE CONTROL.
KATIE LEDECKY LISA COMPETITION IN HER WAKE MOST ?
>> EVERY NIGHT IT'S YOUR NEWS PLAYLISTS. TOP STORY WITH TOM LLAMAS STREAMING WEEKNIGHTS AT 7:00 ON NBC NEWS NOW. >>> WE ARE BACK WITH A NEW
STUDY THAT MAY HAVE YOU THINKING TWICE ABOUT REACHING FOR THAT SWEET TREAT AT THE GROCERY STORE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DARK CHOCOLATE PRODUCTS SOLD AND
MAJOR RETAILERS MAY CONTAIN HIGH LEVELS OF HEAVY METAL LIKE LEAD AND EVEN ARSENIC. WE WANT TO MENTION THOSE LEVELS WERE HIGH NONE OF THEM REACH
THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE DOSE FOR
HUMAN CONSUMPTION. HERE IS MORE. GOOD MORNING.
HOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE ABOUT THAT HEAVY METAL LEVEL IN DARK
CHOCOLATE. COULD IT CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO OUR BODIES ? >> ANY AMOUNT OF LEAD ABOVE WITH THE FDA DEEMS AS EXACT
DOUBLE EXPOSURE AND IN THIS CASE THEY FOUND 43 % OF THE CHOCOLATE THEY TESTED IN
CALIFORNIA OR ABOVE THAT ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF LEAD AN UPGRADE FOR DEVELOPING BRAINS ESPECIALLY YOUNG CHILDREN. IT GOES TO SAY YOU SHOULD DO
ALL OF THIS WITH MODERATION. IT'S LIKELY NOT THAT DANGEROUS IN MODERATION. >> WE SHOULD NOTE THE FDA DOES
NOT SET LIMITS AND HEAVY METALS IN MOST FOODS. THAT RAISED MY EYEBROWS.
HOW CAN WE BE SURE WE ARE LIMITING OUR OWN EXPOSURE TO THESE CHEMICALS.
IS THERE A SUREFIRE WAY TO AVOID THEM IN OUR DIETS OR EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF THEM ? >> THE WAY TO AVOID THE
EXCESSIVE AMOUNT IS BY AVOID EATING AND EXCESSIVE AMOUNT. WHAT MAY SURPRISE PEOPLE IS IT CAN BE A THIRD OF A CANDY BAR
THAT CAN RESULT IN THAT QUOTE ON QUOTE EXCESSIVE AMOUNT. IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT. DARKER CHOCOLATES HAVE HIGHER
AMOUNTS OF LEAD. PEOPLE ARE WONDERING IF THERE ARE CERTAIN BRANDS, WE CAN GO
INTO THAT. YOU LOOK AT THE BRANDS AND IT MAY SURPRISE PEOPLE WHO MAY THINK ORGANIC MAYBE BETTER. YOU NEED TO MODERATE HOW MUCH
YOU EAT ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE
YOUNGER. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE
NOT EATING HIGH AMOUNTS OF THIS. >> CONSUMERS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE QUALITY OF FOOD AND TURN TO ORGANIC OPTIONS AS A WAY TO REDUCE THE RISK OF
INGESTING THESE HEAVY METALS. ARE ORGANIC FOODS SCREENED FOR TOXINS LIKE THIS ? WHICH A PEOPLE KNOW ? >> THIS STUDY INCLUDE ORGANIC FOODS AND DID FIND HIGHER
LEVELS. THIS IS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING TO MOST PEOPLE WILL. THEY DID FIND HIGHER LEVELS OF
LEAD IN THE ORGANIC CHOCOLATE AS WELL. IT'S NOT JUST CHOOSING ORGANIC AND YOU CAN EAT MORE THAN A
THIRD OF A CANDY BAR A DAY. YOU NEED TO WATCH ALL YOUR CONSUMPTION. THIS IS USUALLY IN THE COCOA.
IT'S NOT THE CHOCOLATE ITSELF
HAS THE LEAD INSIDE OF IT. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW CAN WE LIMIT THAT EXPOSURE. THAT WILL TAKE TIME. LIMIT YOUR PERSONAL EXPOSURE IN
THE MEANTIME. >> THANK YOU.
>>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EXTREME WEATHER. EXPERTS ARE SOUNDING THE ALARM OVER HOW MUCH ICE IS MELTING IN
THE ARCTIC. THE SHIFTS ARE WIDESPREAD IMPACTING WEATHER PATTERNS ACROSS THE WORLD.
OUR CLIMATE REPORTER HAS THE DETAILS.
>> Reporter: THE GLACIER IS FIVE MILES WIDE AT THE BOTTOM.
25 MILES LONG. GOES UP TO 9200 FEET. TWO YEARS AGO FLYING ABOVE ALASKA'S EXPANSIVE ICE FIELDS
-- >> THIS ICEBERG BROKE OFF. >> Reporter: YOU CAN SEE THE
SIGNS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. >> THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL. IT'S ALSO SO SAD.
>> WE DON'T HAVE DECADES. WE HARDLY HAVE YEARS.
>> Reporter: RESEARCH NOW CONFIRMS THESE GLACIERS ARE ON THE BRINK. SOME ALREADY PAST THE POINT OF NO RETURN. >> IF ALL OF A SUDDEN THE SNOW
LINE RISES ON TOP OF THE ICEFIELD, YOU WILL NOT HAVE MORE SNOW THE TIPPING POINT IN THIS CASE IS WE DON'T HAVE MORE
INCOME. I WORKED ON 250 GLACIERS AND
EVERY ONE THAT IS TAKEN MEASUREMENTS ON ARE GOING.
OR TWO HE STUDIED ALASKA'S EVOLVING LANDSCAPE OVER THE PAST FOUR DECADES. WHAT ARE THE CHANGES YOU'VE OBSERVED RECENTLY THAT ARE
QUITE DIFFERENT THAN IN DECADES PRIOR ? >> FROM 1948 UP TO 1990, IT WAS
LOSING MASS. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PANIC. THEN IT ACCELERATED AND AFTER
2010 IT REALLY INCREASED. >> Reporter: ALASKA'S HAVING A MAJOR HEAT WAVE. TRENDS THAT HAVE CONSEQUENCES
ON WEATHER PATTERNS. IT FEELS 70 DEGREES OUT AND IT STILL WARMING UP. ENTIRE ECOSYSTEMS COULD RISK
STARVATION. AS WELL AS LOCAL COMMUNITIES.
UNBELIEVABLE. >> ROADS ARE CRUMBLING. AIRPORTS ARE BREAKING APART.
HOMES ARE FALLING. >> Reporter: THIS ALARMING REALITY IS PLAYING AROUND THE
ENTIRE ARCTIC. >> WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THE ARCTIC IS CHANGING FASTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET. AS WE LOSE THESE BRIGHT WHITE
SURFACES, IT'S MAKING THE EARTH
DARKER. MORE OF THE SUN'S ENERGY IS
BEING ABSORBED BY THE SURFACE UNDERNEATH WHETHER IT'S OCEAN OR LAND. IT'S KNOWN AS THE ALBEDO
EFFECT. YOU FELT IT IF YOU WANT A BLACK SHIRT OUTSIDE ON A HOT DAY. DARKER COLORS OBSERVE THE SUN'S ENERGY WHILE WHITE AND LIGHTER
COLORS REFLECT MORE OF THE SUN'S HEAT HELPING YOU STAY COOLER. POLARIZED ENGLISH IS WORK THE
SAME WAY. REFLECTING THE SUN'S ENERGY BACK TO SPACE AND THE MORE WE LOSE THE HOTTER THE EARTH GETS ACCELERATING CLIMATE CHANGE.
EVEN THESE RULES OF CLIMATE CHANGE SEEM TO BE BREAKING DOWN
IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE ARCTIC. >> IT'S A WEIRD PHENOMENON WE ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
>> Reporter: THE TEAM JUST GOT BACK FROM A RESEARCH EXPEDITION TO THE SMALL ISLANDS IN NORWAY.
>> THIS IS AN AREA OF HOTSPOT.
I DON'T WANT TO SAY CLIMATE CHANGE IS TRIGGERING SURGES BUT
THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP THAT WERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
>> Reporter: AND ARCTIC ANOMALY OR FORECAST FOR THE FUTURE ? ONE THING IS CLEAR. FACING A RAPIDLY CHANGING AND
UNPREDICTABLE ARCTIC WITH
>>> WE ARE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS. A MAJOR PRISONER SWAP IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY BETWEEN RUSSIA, THE U.S. AND OTHER NATIONS. THAT'S ACCORDING TO A SENIOR BIDEN MENSTRUATION OFFICIAL.
WE KNOW THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED TO A PRISONER TRANSFER AND ARE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE EXPECTED TO SOON BE IN U.S.
CUSTODY. LET'S BRING AN NBC NEWS REPORTER MATT. RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT THERE IS
NOT A LOT WE CAN REPORT ABOUT THIS EXCHANGE AND THINGS WE DON'T KNOW INCLUDING WHO IS PART OF IT, RIGHT ? >> Reporter: THAT'S CORRECT.
THERE'S A LOT OF KEY DETAILS WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR. SPECIFICALLY WEAR THIS TAKING PLACE AND WHO IS INVOLVED. WHAT WE KNOW THERE ARE A LARGE
NUMBER OF RUSSIANS IN U.S. CUSTODY AND A LOT OF THEM BEING
MIDTIER CYBER CRIMINALS, CONVICTED RUSSIAN SPIES A LOT OF PEOPLE OF THAT NATURE. THERE ARE PROMINENT U.S. CITIZENS IN RUSSIAN DETENTION.
THAT BEING THE WALL STREET JOURNAL EVAN GERSHKOVICH, PAUL
WHALEN. HE'S BEEN WRONGFULLY DETAINED IN RUSSIA FOR MUCH LONGER THAN
EVAN HAS. THERE ARE OTHER NAMES THAT WE'VE BEEN COVERING FOR SOME
TIME. WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION OR CONFIRMATION WHO IS INVOLVED
IN THE TRADE. WE ARE SEEING MANY SIGNS SOME FROM THE RUSSIAN SITE THAT THIS
IS A LARGE TRADE. WE'VE BEEN SEEING RUSSIAN SPECIAL GOVERNMENT FLIGHTS TAKING OFF FROM MOSCOW AND FLYING IN SEVERAL DIRECTIONS.
SOME AIRPLANES PREVIOUSLY USED IN HIGH-PROFILE SWAPS.
THE RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA HAS BEEN REPORTING ON RUSSIA SPIES DETAINED IN SLOVENIA BEING
RELEASED. GIVEN THAT INFORMATION WHAT WE DO NOTE THERE IS THIS SWAP
UNDERWAY BETWEEN RUSSIA, THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES AS YOU MENTIONED. IT DOES APPEAR WE'RE LOOKING AT A LARGE MOVEMENT OF PRISONERS.
AS YOU SAID, WE ARE WAITING FOR A LOT OF INFORMATION. >> WE DO NOT KNOW WHO IS INVOLVED IN THIS PRISONER EXCHANGE BUT DO NOTE THERE HAVE
BEEN EFFORTS TO GET WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTED EVAN
GERSHKOVICH OUT OF RUSSIA. HE WAS RECENTLY CONVICTED AND
SENTENCED. WHAT DOES HIS SITUATION IN RUSSIA STAND RIGHT NOW ? >> Reporter: HE WAS SENTENCED A WEEK AGO TO 16 YEARS IN A
RUSSIAN COLONY ON CHARGES OF
ESPIONAGE. HE'S BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN TARGETS FOR A U.S.-RUSSIA TRADE SINCE HE WAS DETAINED BACK IN
MARCH 2023. HE'S BEEN ONE OF THE NAMES AT THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR THIS ARRANGEMENT. AFTER LAST WEEK'S SENTENCING,
HE WAS FACING 16 YEARS IN A
RUSSIAN PENAL COLONY. RUSSIA TAKES ESPIONAGE VERY SERIOUSLY. OF ALL THE CHARGES YOU CAN FACE IN RUSSIA, IT IS THE WORST TO
FACE. THE ACQUITTAL RATE ACROSS THE RUSSIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS VERY
LOW FOR ALL CRIMES. BELOW 1 %. YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SITUATION WHERE IT'S WORSE WITH
ESPIONAGE. JUST AS PAUL WHELAN DID. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT
EVAN IS ON THE SAME CHARGES AS PAUL WHELAN WHO HAS BEEN THERE FOR FIVE YEARS. PAUL WHELAN HAS SEEN MULTIPLE
TRADES LIKE THIS COME AND GO. HE'S BEEN LEFT OUT EACH AND EVERY TIME.
ALL THIS UNDERSCORES HOW SERIOUS IT IS TO BE ACCUSED OF ESPIONAGE AND CHARGED WITH IT IN RUSSIA. >> THE U.S.-RUSSIA AND OTHER
NATIONS INVOLVED WITH THIS, HOW UNUSUAL IT MAY THAT BE ? ARE
THESE EXCHANGES OFTEN ONE COUNTRY WITH ANOTHER COUNTRY ? >> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. MULTILATERAL PRISONER EXCHANGE IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO
IN IDEAL TIMES. EACH COUNTRY HAS DIFFERENT RULES. IF THIS IS A MULTILATERAL, SO
TO SPEAK, PRISONER TRADE, WE ARE LOOKING AT ONE OF THE
LARGEST TRADES OF THIS KIND SINCE THE COLD WAR POSSIBLY EVEN MORE THAN THAT LOOKING AT WHAT THE SIZE OF THIS COULD BE.
IT SHOULD NOT BE UNDERSTATED HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS MOVEMENT WOULD BE IF IT PLAYS OUT THE WAY WE THINK IT MAY.
>> REMIND US WHY WE ARE BEING SO CAUTIOUS WITH WHAT WE CAN
REPORT. THIS IS A SENSITIVE SITUATION. >> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. THE TRADE IS IN PROCESS. IT'S UNDERWAY. IT HAS NOT BEEN A DONE DEAL.
THAT'S UNDERSCORING THE SENSITIVITY ABOUT REPORTING ON THIS ISSUE AND THE CAUTION.
>> THANK YOU, MATT WE
APPRECIATE YOUR REPORTING AND EXPERTISE. WE WILL KEEP CHECKING IN WITH YOU AS WE LEARN MORE. >>> TAKING FLIGHT. HOW THE PARIS OLYMPICS IS
HONORING THE FIRST HUMANS TO TAKE TO THE SKIES CUT OFF. >> NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF
NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW.
>>> WELCOME BACK. PARIS IS OFTEN REFERRED TO THE CITY OF LIGHTS OR THE CITY OF
LOVE BUT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF ITS HISTORY AS THE CITY OF BALLOONS.
GOT A SCHWARTZ GOT A BIRDS EYE VIEW OF THE FRENCH CAPITAL TO EXPLAIN ITS STORY TIES TO BALLOONS AND WHITE ONE WAS EVEN
PROMINENTLY FEATURED IN LAST WEEK'S STUNNING OPENING CEREMONY.
>> Reporter: THERE IN THE GARDEN, THEY WILL LIGHT THE MOST UNIQUE QUADRANT WE'VE
SEEN. DURING THE OPENING CEREMONY IN PAIRS, A GOLDEN SURPRISE. A BALLOON STEPS FROM THE LOUVRE AND A FLOATY -- FLOATING
OLYMPIC FLAME. THE GOLDEN BALLOON IS MORE THAN OLYMPIC TORCH. IT'S A TRIBUTE O THE BRAVE
PARISIANS. THE FIRST HUMANS TO EVER TAKE FLIGHT AND SOME OF THEM TOOK OFF FROM THIS VERY GARDEN 240 YEARS AGO. BACK EVENT THE FRENCH WERE THE
TWO MASTERS OF THE HEAVENS. FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY BEFORE THE WRIGHT BROTHERS AND THEIR FIRST FLIGHT. PARIS WAS THE CITY OF BALLOONS.
THE FIRST MAN FLIGHTS EVER TAKING OFF FROM PARIS IN 1783. >> IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER SPACE
OBJECT. >> THAT LOOKS LIKE A CELESTIAL BODY. >> Reporter: HE DESIGN THE OLYMPIC CAULDRON HOPING TO TAP IN TO OUR INNATE DESIGN TO GAZE
UP AND WONDER. >> EVERY NIGHT WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN, THE OLYMPIC SON GOES
UP. >> Reporter: WHILE THIS BULLET WILL STAY ON THE GROUND DURING THE DAY FOR CROWDS TO APPRECIATE UP CLOSE, A FEW
MILES AWAY ANOTHER BALLOON WILL GIVE YOU THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE PARISIANS HAVE HAD FOR HUNDREDS
OF YEARS. WOW. JUST LIKE THAT, WE WERE LIGHTER
THAN AIR. >> IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME MAGICAL FEELING I HAVE WHEN I FLY. >> Reporter: HE DREAMED UP THE
BALLOON THAT HE HAD AS A BOY.
BALLOONING WAS ONCE IN THE OLYMPICS. >> YES. IT WAS VERY POPULAR.
THEY TOOK OFF FROM PARIS AND THE WINNER WENT TO KEITH.
>> Reporter: THERE'S THE OTHER BALLOON. THERE ON THE GROUND LIKE DURING
THE FIRST FLIGHTS CENTURIES AGO, THOUSANDS GATHERED.
