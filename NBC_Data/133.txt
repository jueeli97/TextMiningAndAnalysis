>>> WELCOME BACK
THE U.S. AND THE MIDDLE EAST ARE
ON EDGE AFTER TWO SENIOR LEADERS
BACKED BY IRAN IN ACT OF
RESISTANCE WERE KILLED IN TH
SPAN OF 24 HOURS
IT IS AN ALARM BELL FOR
WIDENING WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
EARLIER THIS MORNING THE
POLITICAL LEADER OF HAMAS WA
KILLED WHILE IN TEHRAN ACCORDING
TO SOURCES
IRAN IS BLAMING ISRAEL FOR THE
ATTACK AND VOWING RETALIATION.
ISRAEL HAS NOT COMMENTED ON TH
STRIKE
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAID THAT
ISRAEL HAD DEALT A CRUSHING BLOW
AND WARNED OF CHALLENGING DAYS
AHEAD AND SAID THAT ISRAEL I
PREPARED FOR ANY SCENARIO.
SECRETARY OF STATE ANTON
BLINKEN SAID THAT THE U.S. WAS
NOT AWARE OF OR INVOLVED IN TH
DEATH.
THE HAMAS LEADER WAS A KEY
PLAYER IN THE CEASE FIRE TALKS
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS
THIS COULD DERAIL NEGOTIATIONS
TOSTOP THE FIGHTING AND ENSURE
THE RELEASE OF REMAINING
HOSTAGES IN GAZA
THE WHITE HOUSE ADDRESSE
CONCERNS OF A SPIRALLING
CONFLICT IN THE REGION
>> THE REPORTS OF THE LAST 24 TO
48 HOURS DON'T HELP WITH THE
TEMPERATURE GOING DOWN
I'M NOT GOING TO BE POLLY ANNISH
ABOUT IT
WE ARE CONCERNED BUT THERE IS NO
SIGN THAT IT IS IMMINENT
I ALSO SAID WE WILL WATCH IT
VERY CLOSELY
>> JOINING ME NOW IS RAF SANCHEZ
AND KURT COURTNEY KUBE
I WANT T TO TALK ABOUT THE
STRIKE AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
FOR HAMAS LEADERSHIP
>> WELL, AS YOU SAID, BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU IS REFUSING TO GIV
DETAILS ON THE STRIKE, NOT
SAYING ISRAEL IS RESPONSIBLE
NOT DENYING THAT ISRAEL IS
RESPONSIBLE.
THAT IS IN LINE WITH ISRAELI
POLICY
THEY OFTEN SAY NOTHING ABOUT THE
HIGH STAKES COVERT OPERATION
THAT TAKE PLACE OVERSEAS
A LOT OF WHAT WE KNOW IS COMIN
FROM IRANIAN STATE MEDIA
1:45 IRAN TIME, AN ISRAELI
MISSILE HIT THE RESIDENCE OF THE
HANIYEH, THE POLITICAL CHIEF O
HAMAS, KILLING HIM AND ONE O
HIS BODY GUARDS, A COUPLE OF
HOURS AFTER HE WAS MEETING WIT
IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER, ANOTHER
ENEMY OF ISRAEL.
IN TERMS OF HAMAS'S LEADERSHIP
ISRAEL SAID IT WOULD HUNT DOWN
THE TOP LEADERS OF HAMAS AFTER
THE OCTOBER 7 ATTACK
THEY HAVE KILLED THE POLITICAL
CHIEF, HIS DEPUTY, THEY APPEAR
TO HAVE KILLED THE HEAD OF THE
MILITARY WING IN A STRIKE IN
GAZA EARLIER THIS MONTH.
THAT BASICALLY LEAVES SIN WA
WHO IS BELIEVED TO BE IN THE
TUNNELS IN THE NEATH GAZA.
AND WHILE HANIYEH WAS A CHIE
NEGOTIATOR, ISRAEL AND THE U.S
HAVE SAID THAT IT IS SINWAR WH
IS THE SEE DECISION MAKER FO
HAMAS.
>> AND HOW ARE PEOPLE IN ISRAEL,
PARTICULARLY THE HOSTAGE
FAMILIES, HOW ARE THEY REACTIN
TO THIS?
>> WE SPOKE EARLIER TO THE
GRANDSON OF ONE OF THE OLDES
HOSTAGES STILL BEING HELD IN
GAZA
84-YEAR-OLD A.
HIS GRANDFATHER SAID HE IS
DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT IT COULD
DERAIL THE HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS.
HE IS APPEALING TO THE U.S. AN
QATAR TO KEEP THE NEGOTIATIONS
ON TRACK
IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FO
ISRAEL AND HAMAS TO INDIRECTLY
REENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS, GIVE
THE SCALE OF THE LOSS ON THE
HAMAS SIDE
WE HEARD FROM THE PRIME MINISTER
OF QATAR, BASICALLY TELLING US
HOW ARE WE EXPECTED TO MEDIATE
WHEN ONE SIDE OF THE NEGOTIATION
TABLE IS KILLING THE OTHER
>> RAF SANCHEZ LIVE FOR US I
TEL AVIV, THANK YOU
I WANT TO TURN TO COURTNEY KUBE.
ANYTHING FROM THE OFFICIALS AT
THE PENTAGON ON THE STRIKES?
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN SAYIN
IT BELIEVES THAT A WIDER WAR I
INEVITABLE
ARE PENTAGON OFFICIALS SAYIN
THE SAME THING
>> THEY ARE.
WE ARE GETTING THE SAME MESSAGE.
THEY STARTED A DIRECT ATTACK I
GOLAN HEIGHTS THAT KILLED
DOZEN CHILDREN
THE STRIKE OR WHATEVER IT WAS,
THE KILLING OF HANIYEH I
TEHRAN, WE ARE NOT GETTING A LOT
OF DETAIL.
I KNOW RAF MENTIONED WHAT HAMA
AND IRAN ARE TELLING US BUT WE
REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW HE WAS
KILLED
WE DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL O
DETAIL
BUT THE IDEA OF A LARGER
ESCALATION, THE CONCERN IS BASED
ON THE IDEA THAT CREW THEY B
INTERESTED IN GOING AFTER ISRAEL
IN THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS
THEY COULD BE ATTACKED ON AL
FRONTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE
MEDITERRANEAN.
FROM HEZBOLLAH TO THE NORTH AN
THEY COULD HAVE STRIKES FROM
IRAN FROM THE WEST AND THE
COULD TAKE STRIKES FROM TH
HOUTH HOUTHIS IN THE RED SEA YUR
AREA
THIS COULD BE A LARGER ATTACK.
IN ADDITION TO A LARGE
RETALIATION OR RESPONSE, I
ADDITION TO THAT, THERE IS A
REAL CONCERN THAT THE FACT THA
THIS STRIKE OCCURRED INSID
TEHRAN, A POLITICAL LEADER O
HAMAS COULD BE A MAJOR POINT O
EMBARRASSMENT FOR IRAN
FOR THAT REASON, WHATEVER TH
RETALIATION IS, IT COULD BE MORE
ESCLATORY.
HERE IN THE PENTAGON U.S
OFFICIALS AND THROUGHOUT
WASHINGTON D.C., OFFICIALS O
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ARE
URGING CALM AND HOPING THIS DOES
NOT ESCALATE BUT THIS IS A
POSSIBILITY.
>> AND LOOK, NOTHING HAPPENS I
A VACUUM
WE ARE IN AN ELECTION YEAR
IF VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WERE TO
WIN, THERE IS STILL SOME W
DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER A
COMMANDER AND CHIEF.
WHAT ARE NATIONAL SECURITY
OFFICIALS SAYING ABOUT HER
NATIONAL POLICY?
>> IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG
PROJECT.
WE SPOKE TO ABOUT THREE DOZE
OFFICIALS WHO WORKED WITH HER IN
THE NATIONAL SECURITY AN
FOREIGN POLICY STATE
IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH
OR SDERN ANY NATIONAL OR FOREIGN
POLICY THAT HARRIS HAS THAT IS
DIFFERENT THAN BIDEN
HER DETRACTORS WOULD SAY THAT IS
EVIDENCE SHE DOESN'T HAVE
POLICY AT ALL.
HER SUPPORTERS SAY SHE IS A VICE
PRESIDENT AND HER ROLE IS TO
SUPPORT THE COMMANDER AND CHIE
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE HAS BEEN
DOING FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS
WE ASKED ABOUT ANY POTENTIAL
DIFFERENCES.
THERE IS SOME BELIEF THAT SH
MAY SHOW MORE EMPATHY WHEN I
COMES TO THINGS LIKE GAZA,
HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS, WIT
WOMEN AND CHILDREN
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PUBLI
COMMENTS, IT IS NOT REFLECTED.
HER TONE AND EMPHASIS IS A
LITTLE DIFFERENT
THE OVERALL MESSAGE TRACKS WIT
PRESIDENT BIDEN.
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEARN MOR
ABOUT HOW SHE ACTS IN SOME O
THESE MEETINGS
EVERYTHING FROM THE WITHDRAWAL
OF AFGHAN TAN TO THE WAR I
UKRAINE AND THE MANY NATIONA
SECURITY ISSUES THAT HAVE COME
UP SINCE THEN.
AND SHE HAS POINTED AND DIRECTED
QUESTIONS THAT TEND TO OPEN TH
8 BALL
>> COURTNEY KUBE LIVE FOR US A
THE PENTAGON, THANK YOU.
>>> FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR AT THE
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT FOR THE
MIDDLE EAST REGION IS JOINING US
NOW, HEAD AT TRENT RESEARCH AN
ADVISORY, THANK YOU FOR JOININ
US
PUT TOGETHER WHAT DO THESE
DEVELOPMENTS MEAN FOR TH
REGION
ARE THE PROSPECTS OF A REGIONA
WAR GREATER TODAY?
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU
I THINK THE PAST WEEKS AND
MONTHS ALL POINT TO STRIKING
PARADOX IN THE REGION WHICH IS
WE ARE INCHING CLOSER TO AN AL
OUT WAR BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE
IRAN P LED AXIS EVEN THOUGH
BELIEVE IT IS AN UNLIKELY WA
BECAUSE NEITHER SIDE WANTS IT.
SO THE QUESTION IS WHY WOULD
ISRAEL CONDUCT SUCH ATTACK
WHICH CANNOT BE VIEWED BUT A
PROVOCATIVE.
THE ISRAELS BELIEVE THE IRANIANS
ARE NOT DETERRED FROM LAUNCHIN
AN ALL OUT WAR, THE SAME WAY
THAT THE IRANIANS BELIEVE THAT
ISRAEL IS DETERRED FROM AN ALL
OUT WAR.
THERE IS ROOM FOR MISCALCULATION
AND ACCIDENTS WHICH YOU SAW WITH
THE ATTACK OF HEZBOLLAH.
IT IS A FOR TAT THAT
CONTINUES.
WE ARE EDGING CLOSER TO WAR BU
NEITHER SIDE WANTS IT.
>> ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT ISRAEL
WOULD TAKE OUT HAMAS'S POLITICAL
LEADER AT THE SAME TIME TH
CEASE FIRE NEGOTIATIONS AR
UNDERWAY
DOESN'T THAT UNDERMINE OR DOES
THAT MAKE SENSE?
>> ON ONE HAND, IT DOESN'T
FRANKLY.
IT GOES BACK TO WHAT THE GOAL OF
THE ISRAELIS IS.
THEY HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE
GOAL IS TOTAL VICTORY.
THAT MEANS YOU DECAPITATE TH
LEADERSHIP OF HAMAS AND GO AFTER
MILITARY CAPACITY AND DO
EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO CRUSH TH
ORGANIZATION
THEY ARE SAYING THIS IS
CRUSHING BLOW.
I BEG TO DIFFER.
I DON'T THINK IT HURTS HAMAS
THAT MUCH.
HE DOESN'T REALLY CALL THE SHOTS
IN GAZA.
IT IS SINWAR WHO CALLS THE
SHOTS.
THIS IS A GUY WHO WAS INVOLVED
IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE
ISRAELIS, TO THE QATARI PROCESS.
SO YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE
DAY, YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT I
YOUR OBJECTIVE HERE?
IS IT TO REACH A CEASE FIRE OR
DECIMATE HAMAS
YOU CAN'T DO BOTH.
>> SO WHO WOULD FILL THE
LEADERSHIP ROLE AND BE THE
NEGOTIATOR IFSINWAR IS CALLING
THE SHOTS?
>> YOEPG WE KNOW
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS
THEY WILL FIND ANOTHER POLITICAL
NEGOTIATOR WHETHER OUTSIDE O
GAZA OR INSIDE GAZA.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
THE GUY WHO HAS INFLUENCE OVER
THE PROCESS IS SINWAR.
HE SEEMS TO HAVE MELLOWED
LITTLE WITH THE DEMANDS HE HAD
BEFORE BUT WITH THIS ATTACK,
THIS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUP
AND DELAY NEGOTIATIONS
>> SO WILL THIS CHANGE THE
ADMINISTRATION 'S CALCULUS O
STRATEGY WHEN IT COMES TO TH
MIDDLE EAST?
DOES THE FOCUS S BECOME LESS O
GAZA NOW AND MORE ON IRAN?
>> POSSIBLY BUT AT THE END O
THE DAY, YOU HAD AN ISRAEL
PRIME MINISTER WHO I
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THESE I
THE MIDDLE EAST AND NOT LOWERING
THE TEMPERATURE AND NOT GOING TO
A CEASE FIRE
HE CAME TO WASHINGTON AND HAD
STANDING OVATION
SO WE ARE NOT GETTING OUR OW
OBJECTIVES IN THE MIDDLE EAS
NOW.
WE HAVE YET TO COMMUNICATE CLEAR
AND SIGNIFICANT RED LINES TO THE
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER IN TERM
OF LIMIT OF SUPPORT FOR AN
CONTINUATION OF THE ATTACKS HE
IS WAGING.
SO YES, ARE WE GOING TO SHIF
THE ATTENTION TO PREVENTING
LARGE SCALE CONFRONTATION?
YES, THAT'S WHAT WE DID WHEN THE
IRANIANS AND ISRAELIS ENGAGED IN
AN IT FOR TAT.
BUT WE ARE FOCUSED ON A CEAS
FIRE EXCEPT WITH THE LATES
ATTACKS, WE AR
