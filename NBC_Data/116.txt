>> WE'VE GOT TO GO! GOT TO GO RIGHT NOW! [ BLEEP ]
>> DANGEROUS WILDFIRES ARE POPPING UP LEFT AND RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA, RAISING CONCERNS THAT FIRE CREWS COULD NOT ONLY
BE FIGHTING THIS FOR THE REST OF THE SUMMER, BUT DEEP INTO
FALL. I AM VALERIE CASTRO IN FOR GADI SCHWARTZ, AND THIS IS "STAY TUNED NOW."
California's fifth largest wildfire ever
â™ª >>> ONE OF THOSE MYERS PEOPLE ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE
PARK FIRE, IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IT IS NOW THE FIFTH LARGEST WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY.
AN AREA BIGGER THAN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS BURNED.
390,000 ACRES ACROSS MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND HAS DESTROYED HUNDREDS OF STRUCTURES SINCE IT
STARTED ABOUT A WEEK AGO. AMID THE EVACUATIONS ONE MAN CHOSE TO DEFEND HIS HOME USING A PRESSURE PUMP AND SPRINKLERS.
>> I DECIDED TO STAY, I HAD A COUPLE PEOPLE WITH ME TO FIGHT THE FIRE. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE STUFF WE PULLED OFF UNDER INTENSE
PRESSURE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST FIRES NOW IN OUR
HISTORY COMING OUR WAY. >> AND, THERE IS ANOTHER FIRE
BURNING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THE NIXON FIRE, WHICH HAS FORCED MORE EVACUATIONS AND
BURNED NEARLY 4000 ACRES SINCE IT STARTED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. BUT, IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA.
IN COLORADO HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE EVACUATED AS THE ALEXANDER MOUNTAIN FIRE CONTINUES TO SPREAD A DANGEROUS COMBINATION OF WOOD AND DRY CONDITIONS ARE
MAKING IT WORSE. IN VERMONT, A DIFFERENT KIND OF WEATHER EMERGENCY.
LIFE-THREATENING FLASH FLOODING IS STILL IMPACTING PARTS OF THE STATE HIT WITH HEAVY RAINFALL
OVERNIGHT, LEADING TO TWO DOZEN RESCUES AND SEEMS LIKE THIS ONE, ROADS WASHED AWAY. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE TONIGHT, METEOROLOGIST BILL KARINS ,
ERIN McLAUGHLIN, BUT FIRST, LIZ KREUTZ, WHAT IS THE LATEST
STATUS ON THE PARK FIRE? AND TELL US ABOUT THE DAMAGE IT'S LEAVING BEHIND-- >> Reporter: YEAH, WELL,
VALERIE, THIS CONTINUES TO BE A MASSIVE FIRE, THE FIFTH LARGEST IN STATE HISTORY, THE LARGEST
EARNING IN CALIFORNIA SO FAR THIS YEAR. IT'S BEEN HARD FOR FIREFIGHTER
. IT'S BEEN HOVERING AT THE CONTAINMENT LEVEL ALL DAY, THAT IS NOT GREAT, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY PROGRESS FROM WHAT
WE HAD SEEN. FIREFIGHTERS DO SEEM TO FEEL THEY ARE GETTING A HANDLE ON
THIS FIRE, BUT NOT WITHOUT IT LEAVING BEHIND MASSIVE DESTRUCTION. 192 STRUCTURES DESTROYED.
HOMES, PROPERTY, AND ALSO AT LEAST 19 OTHER STRUCTURES
DAMAGED. SO, A LOT OF THESE SAME IMAGES WE'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER IN CALIFORNIA.
THEY LOST THEIR HOME IN THE PARADISE FIRE WHICH BURNED IN THE SAME AREA, THAT DEADLY FIRE NOW MOVING TO A NEW HOME,
LOSING THEIR HOME IN THIS FIRE, JUST A REALLY SAD, HARD SITUATION FOR MANY HERE, VALERIE. >> THIS TIME, YESTERDAY, WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS WAS THE SIXTH LARGEST IN STATE HISTORY, IT IS NOW THE FIFTH
LARGEST.
IT CONTINUES TO GROW. EVACUATION ORDERS HAVE LIFTED, IN SOME AREAS. HOW DO OFFICIALS RECONCILE THESE TWO THINGS? >> Reporter: I THINK IT SPEAKS
TO HOW MASSIVE THIS FIRE IS, WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A FIRE HALF THE SIZE OF RHODE ISLAND. IT CONTINUES TO GROW IN SOME
AREAS. AND CAL FIRE, WHEN THEY SAY CONTAINMENT, IT MEANS HOW
MUCH THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE A PERIMETER, A FIRE LINE.
ONLY 14% RIGHT NOW. SOME OF THOSE AREAS, THOSE ARE
THE AREAS WHERE EVACUATIONS HAVE BEEN LIFTED BUT STEEP
TERRAIN, WE HAVE BEEN LATER TODAY, MORE HIGH HEAT IS COMING
IN TODAY WHICH CONTINUES TO MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING. IN THOSE AREAS WERE EVACUATION ORDERS HAVE BEEN LIFTED, NO
LONGER THREATENED. >> HOW ARE FIRE CREWS KEEPING UP WITH ALL OF THIS IN HANDLING
THE CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY? >> Reporter: IT'S BEEN HARD.
THERE'S BEEN TALK MAKING SURE STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES THEY NEED. GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM WAS OUT
SURVEYING THE DAMAGE OF ONE OF THE FIRES. HE DECLARED AN EMERGENCY TO
ALLOW FOR MORE FEDERAL RESOURCES TO COME TO THE STATE AND HELP THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOMES IN THE FIRE. AND WE ARE TALKING A MASSIVE
AMOUNT OF RESOURCES MORE THAN 5500 PERSONNEL FIGHTING THE PARK FIRE ALONE.
THEY WILL SOMETIMES FLY CREWS IN FROM AUSTRALIA TO HELP IN THE WINTER SEASON THERE.
PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT REGIONS COME TO HELP FIGHT THESE FIRES RIGHT NOW. >> A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF THEM. LIZ KREUTZ, THANK YOU.
LET'S BRING IN NBC NEWS METEOROLOGIST, BILL KARINS . WHAT ARE WEST COAST CONDITIONS LIKE RIGHT NOW MAKING THIS SO
MUCH WORSE MARK >> YES, VALERIE, IN THE ROCKIES, WE HAVE SEEN PICTURES
OF THE COLORADO, NORTH OF DENVER AND FORT COLLINS, THAT FIRE HAS BEEN EXPLODING, BUT
CALIFORNIA, WE HAVEN'T HAD EXPLOSIVE DEVELOPMENT OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS, BECAUSE THE
WINDS HAVE DECREASED AND IMAGERS HAVE DROPPED, A LITTLE BIT. THE PARK FIRE ONLY INCREASED BY
ABOUT 15,000 ACRES. IT'S A LOT, BUT NOT COMPARED TO HOW IT EXPLODED OVER THE PAST
WEEKEND. THAT'S WHY THE CONTAINMENT NUMBER HAS CREPT UP AS WELL. THERE IS ACTIVE FLAMES ON FIRE
WITH THAT, BUT WE HAVE BEEN DOWN. THIS IS WHAT THE FIREFIGHT IS
LIKE. FIREFIGHTERS DON'T LIKE IT WHEN WINDS GET TO 30 MILES AN HOUR
AND ABOVE. IT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT. HEAT IS RETURNING. THE FIRES ARE IN THE MOUNTAINS,
SO CHICO, LOWER ELEVATIONS, THEY ARE EASILY REACHING 100 OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THIS IS MORE INDICATIVE OF WHAT
FIREFIGHTERS WILL DEAL WITH. 90s, MORE WINDY CONDITIONS IN THE AFTERNOON, WE WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT FIRES SPREADING MORE RAPIDLY IN THE DAYS AHEAD. AS FAR AS THE SMOKE GOES, THE
DENSE STUFF IN SOUTHERN MONTANA, HEADING INTO THE DAKOTAS. AS WE GO THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT THERE THROUGH
MINNESOTA, AND THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW HEADS THROUGH WISCONSIN AND TOWARDS CHICAGO, EVENTUALLY TOMORROW NIGHT. >> WE NOTE IT IS DRY OUT WEST, BUT IT'S DRY IN OTHER PARTS OF
THE COUNTRY. >> WE'VE BEEN WATCHING A CENTRAL PORTION OF THE NATION. TO THE NORTH WE HAVE HEAT WAVES
TO THE SOUTH. AS WE GO
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT IT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. THE WORST OF IT FROM OWA DOWN TO ST. LOUIS, ISOLATED STRONG STORMS TOWARD ATLANTA.
NUMEROUS REPORTS OF WIND DAMAGE
IN TENNESSEE, AND, WE HAVE CLUSTERS OF STORMS, ONE OF THEM APPROACHES ATLANTA AREA ROUGHLY IN AN HOUR OR SO.
THERE ARE WARNINGS FOR STRONG GUSTY WINDS. WE HAVE STRONG BLUNDERS THUNDERSTORMS, CONDITIONS ARE
NOT RIPE FOR TORNADOES, JUST WIND DAMAGE. THEN SIMILAR AREAS, OHIO, IOWA,
TO DES MOINES, RISK OF DAMAGING WINDS. ALSO HEAVY RAINFALL IS THE
THING TO WATCH OUT FOR. IN AREAS OF IOWA, I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE SEEN PICTURES EARLIER
VERMONT, OVERNIGHT LAST NIGHT HAD ABOUT A 1 IN 1000-YEAR
Flooding in Vermont
FLOOD EVENT. >> THAT'S A LOT TO KEEP TRACK OF. BILL KARINS, THANK YOU.
>>> AS BILL MENTIONED, THE STORMS ARE MAKING MATTERS WORSE, IN VERMONT, WERE
OVERNIGHT FLOODING HAS LEFT SOME COMMUNITIES DEVASTATED NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, ERIN McLAUGHLIN, JOINS ME, FROM
VERMONT. TELL US ABOUT THE DAMAGE YOU ARE SEEING ON THE GROUND. >> Reporter: HEY, VALERIE. IN SOME PARTS OF VERMONT, 8
INCHES, PLUS, OF RAIN FELL WITHIN A 24-HOUR PERIOD LEAVING
BEHIND SCENES OF DESTRUCTION, LIKE THIS. I WANT TO TAKE YOU ON A LITTLE WALK TO SEE WHAT WAS LEFT BEHIND. THIS IS BELIEVED TO BE THE
PRODUCT OF A SINGLE RAINSTORM. YOU SEE DOWNED TREES, DOWNED
POWER LINES, HOMES COMPLETELY SUBMERGED TOWARD THE WHOLE AREA, SUBMERGED UP UNTIL AROUND 3:00 P.M. THE WATER HAS NOW RECEDED.
BUT, IT HAS DEVASTATED HOMES. LOCAL RESIDENT, JEREMY GREER,
LIVES IN THIS AREA. HE CAME HOME LAST NIGHT AROUND 2:40 A.M.
, HE SAID IT WAS RAINING HARD. HE SAID WATER FROM THE LOCAL CREEK WAS RISING, AND HE KNEW
HE NEEDED TO GET HIS FAMILY, AND HIS NEIGHBORS OUT. HE WENT TO THE HOME OVER THAT WAY, TWO ELDERLY WOMEN NEEDED
TO EVACUATE, CALLED LOCAL AUTHORITIES, MADE IT JUST IN
TIME, BECAUSE NOT MUCH WAS LEFT BEHIND.
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A NIGHTMARE. I'M JUST WAITING TO WAKE UP. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO REALLY
DESCRIBE IT. HER HOUSE, THE OTHER NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE, MY HOUSE, IS TORN TO SHREDS. MY ROOF IS THERE.
MY HOUSE IS OVER THERE. MY BEDROOM WALLS ARE DOWN THERE.
ABSOLUTE DISASTER. >> Reporter: AND THIS IS THE SECOND TIME HIS HOME HAS BEEN
FLOODED IN THE LAST MONTH. EARLIER THIS MONTH IT WAS ALSO FLOODED BY HURRICANE BERYL, OR
RATHER, THE REMNANTS. HE FEELS HE NEEDS TO LEAVE THIS
AREA. >> HOW DID HE GET SO BAD, ERIN? IS ANYTHING BEING DONE TO
PREVENT MORE? WE KNOW MORE WEATHER IS ON THE WAY. COUNTRY IN SPEAKING WITH
METEOROLOGISTS THEY TELL ME THIS IS THE PRODUCT OF CLIMATE
CHANGE, THAT VERMONT SIMPLY HAS NOT SEEN THIS MUCH RAIN AND RECENT YEARS, POINTING TO THAT CHANGE IN THE CLIMATE. IN TERMS
OF WHAT HAPPENED HERE IT COMES DOWN TO THE TOPOGRAPHY. THESE CREEKS ARE NOT FORMED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE VOLUME OF
WATER THAT THEY SAW IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. THEY ARE EXPECTING MORE THUNDERSTORMS FORECAST FOR
TOMORROW, BUT THEY ARE SAYING BECAUSE THERE ARE LOCALIZED EVENTS IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL
WHERE THIS RAINFALL IS GOING TO
HAPPEN. SO, AS WE SAW LAST NIGHT, LOCALS DON'T GET MUCH NOTICE. >> OKAY, ERIN McLAUGHLIN, INVER NIGHT IN VERMONT TONIGHT.
New Secret Service leader: 'Ashamed' over Trump shooting
>>> SECRET SERVICE AGENTS LOSE JOBS AFTER FAILING TO SECURE
THE PERIMETER WHERE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HELD A RALLY.
AT TIMES THEY APPEARED
FRUSTRATED. >> I WENT TO THE ROOF OF THE AGR BUILDING, WHERE THE ASSAILANT FIRED SHOTS, AND I LAID DOWN IN A PRONE POSITION
TO ATTAIN HIS LINE OF SIGHT. WHAT I SAW MADE ME ASHAMED, AS
A CAREER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, AND A 25-YEAR VETERAN WITH THE SECRET SERVICE, I CANNOT DEFEND WHY THAT AREA WAS
NOT BETTER SECURED. >> JUSTICE REPORTER RYAN RILEY, NBC NEWS, JOINS US NOW.
WHAT DID DIRECTOR RONALD ROWE
LEARN? >> WE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE ROOF, AND IT GAVE THE
SHOOTER A GREAT VIEW. HE WAS ABLE TO SORT OF HIDE ON THE ONE
SIDE OF THE SLOPE AND FIRE OVER. WE HAVE SEEN IMAGES ON YOUR
SCREEN FROM SECRET SERVICE THAT SHOWED THE VANTAGE POINT WAS THERE. THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE COUNTER SNIPERS COULDN'T QUITE SEE HIM AS HE SNUCK UP, THE
SLOPE ON THE ROOF GAVE HIM A
MOMENT TO POP OUT BEFORE SHOTS WERE FIRED, NEAR SECONDS IS ALL IT TOOK TO AN THE THREAT.
IT WAS ENOUGH WINDOW FOR HIM TO GET THOSE SHOTS OFF, THOUGH. IN THE COMING DAYS, IN THE
COMING MONTHS, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THESE FAILURES TO PLACE, VALERIE. >> WE LEARNED THERE WERE ROUGHLY
30 SECONDS FOR THE SHOOTER, WHEN HE FIRED THOSE SHOTS, DID THE ACTING DIRECTOR OR SAY
IMMEDIATE ACTION WAS NOT TAKEN? IN THOSE CRITICAL MOMENTS?
>> IS WHAT THE ACTING DIRECTOR HAD TO SAY. >> I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT BASED ON WHAT I KNOW RIGHT NOW NEITHER THE SECRET SERVICE
COUNTER SNIPER TEAMS, NOR MEMBERS OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S SECURITY DETAIL HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WAS A
MAN ON THE ROOF OF THE AGR BUILDING WITH A FIREARM. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THOSE PERSONNEL WERE NOT AWARE THE
ASSAILANT HAD A FIREARM UNTIL THEY HEARD GUNSHOTS PRIOR TO THAT THEY WERE OPERATING WITH
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS WORKING AN ISSUE OF A SUSPICIOUS INDIVIDUAL PRIOR TO THE SHOTS
BEING FIRED. >> THEY REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF INFO THERE, AS YOU AN
HEAR IN THAT REPORT. IT'S REALLY COMMON WHERE EVERYONE WAS ON ALERT, BUT IT
WASN'T THIS COMPLETE PANICKED SITUATION THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO
HAVE, THERE WAS AN ACTIVE GUNMAN ON THE ROOF. 30 SECONDS. THAT WAS CRITICAL.
THE COMMUNICATION THAT WAS BROKEN DOWN THERE, BETWEEN THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO ARE SORT OF SUPPLEMENTING THE SECRET SERVICES OPERATIONS AND THE SECRET SERVICES,
THEMSELVES. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT IN THE COMING MONTHS, VALERIE. >> DO WE HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE
OF WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THE FAILURE? >> WE DON'T. THE JOB OF THE FBI IS A FACT
FINDING MISSION. THEY WON'T BE
ASSIGNING BLAME, IT'S NOT REALLY THEIR ROLE HERE. THEY WILL BE GATHERING THE FACTS AND PRODUCING AS MUCH OF THAT TO THE LOOK. IT HAS BEEN BECAUSE THE SUSPECT
HERE IS DEAD. IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER THAT WILL BE A PROBLEM DOWN THE LINE IS YOU ARE PROSECUTING THESE CASES, SO THE FBI, THEY
HAD A BRIEFING, YESTERDAY, AND I THINK AS MORE INFORMATION COMES IN, THEY WANT TO GET AS
TRANSPARENT AS THEY CAN COME IN
New calls for accountability in death of Sonya Massey
THE WAKE OF THE SHOOTING, VALERIE. >> NBC NEWS JUSTICE REPORTER,
RYAN , THANK YOU. >>> BREAKING TONIGHT, NEW CALLS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN ILLINOIS AFTER THE DEATH OF SONYA MASSEY. 36-YEAR-OLD MOTHER WAS SHOT DEAD BY A POLICE OFFICER IN HER

FIRED THAT FORMER DEPUTY, SEAN GRAYSON. HE SAYS HIS OFFICERS FAILED, PARAPHRASING, AND HE ASKED FOR
FORGIVENESS. I SPOKE WITH MASSEY'S SON. HERE'S WHAT HE TOLD ME.
THE SHERIFF, WHO HIRED AND FIRED THE DEPUTY, WHO ENDED YOUR MOM'S LIFE SAID, THAT THEY
FAILED HER, THEY FAILED YOU, AND HE IS ASKING FOR FORGIVENESS. DOES THAT GIVE YOU ANY COMFORT?
>> I DON'T KNOW, I THINK THE PERSON WHO DID IT IT'S IT
SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
>> Reporter: THE FAMILY IS
PUSHING FOR JUSTICE, THEY HAVE THE BACKING OF REVEREND AL SHARPTON, AS WELL AS CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY BEN CRUM, WHO IS
REPRESENTING THE FAMILY ON THE CIVIL SIDE. THEY ARE INSIDE THIS CHURCH
FIND ME ON CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE AS THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND, AND EVEREND AL SHARPTON SPEAKING WITH NEARLY
300 INSIDE, TELLING THEM TO NOT STOP FIGHTING FOR WHAT THEY
CALL JUSTICE. >> AS WE MENTIONED, THE DEPUTY INVOLVED WAS FIVE, THE UNION
ORIGINALLY REQUESTED HE BE REINSTATED, BUT THERE'S BEEN A
CHANGE OF HEART. RIGHT? >> Reporter: YEAH, THERE HAS. ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE NEWS
CONFERENCE, WE LEARNED FROM THAT LABOR ORGANIZATION, AND I WANT TO READ PART OF THOSE STATEMENTS THAT SAID IN PART
OBLIGATION TO ALL OUR MEMBERS TO PRESERVE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS
CONTAINED IN OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. THEY THE PROCESS WITH
DETERMINATION SHALL BE MADE REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT SEAN

BEIRUT. >> Reporter: HEZBOLLAH, HERE, IN LEBANON'S CAPITAL, IN AN
ATTACK IDF SAYS KILLED ONE OF THE TOP LEADERS. THE LEADER LED AN ATTACK ON A
SOCCER FIELD IN GOLAN HEIGHTS OVER THE WEEKEND THAT KILLED 12 CHILDREN. IT'S STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER THE
LEADER WITH A LARGE BOUNTY ON
HIS HEAD FROM THE UNITED STATES, IS DEAD. LEBANON OFFICIALS SAY HE SURVIVED THE ATTACK.
WE'VE HEARD FROM ISRAELIS WHO WERE CLEAR AND IN THE PAST WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED ASSASSINATIONS THAT WERE SUCCESSFULLY ENDED UP BEING SO.
AND SO WE CAN MORE OR LESS BELIEVE THE ISRAELIS AT THIS POINT UNLESS WE HEAR FURTHER
NEWS, BUT THERE ARE FEARS THIS MIGHT NOT BE OVER, THAT
TONIGHT'S ATTACKS COULD CAUSE WIDESPREAD FIGHTING AND COULD
INVOLVE OTHER GROUPS. HEZBOLLAH, LIKE HAMAS, IS
BACKED BY IRAN. IRAN HAS OTHER CLIENT GROUPS OPPOSED TO ISRAEL AND AMERICA THROUGH THE ENTIRE REGION.
IF THIS WERE WERE TO BREAK UP BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON IT COULD BRING IN IRAN,
IT COULD BRING IN THE UNITED STATES, PARKING UNITS OFF THE
COAST FOR MONTHS. IT DOES NOT BELIEVE WAR IS

THAT VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IS LIKELY TO BE AT THE TOP OF THIS TICKET.
SHE WAS HERE TONIGHT TALKING TO HER CAMPAIGN SAYS, 10,000 PEOPLE, WHO PACKED THIS ARENA. PEOPLE WERE ECSTATIC.
THERE WAS SO MUCH ENERGY. PEOPLE WERE DANCING. THEY SAID
THEY WERE GOING TO WALK IT OUT TO THE POLLS. AND, PEOPLE WERE ALSO CHANTING A NUMBER OF THINGS RIGIDLY
ATTACKING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, SAYING "LOCK HIM UP." THEY ARE SAYING HE IS SCARED, TOUCHING ON THE IDEA THAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES NOT WANT TO AT THIS POINT
DEBATE VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS. THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY, AND DEMOCRATS I SPOKE WITH SAID THEY WERE WORRIED WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS UNCERTAIN
ON HIS FUTURE, NOW THEY FEEL A NEW ENTHUSIASM. I TALKED WITH ANOTHER VOTER, WHO SAID HE HAD NEVER REALLY
FELT ENTHUSIASM AT THIS LEVEL. WE ARE SEEING ON THE GROUND HERE, AND GEORGIA IS A STATE
WHERE BIDEN WON BY UNDER 12,000 VOTES, SO THIS IS A STATE WHERE
THE PEOPLE IN THIS ARENA WILL ALMOST SWING AN ELECTION. IT UNDERSCORES WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE AND WHY THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS CHOOSING TO REALLY
DEBUT THEIR PRIME TIME.
>> SINCE BECOMING THE DE FACTO
NOMINEE, LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO THE ADS. >> IS A PROSECUTOR SHE PUT MURDERERS AND ABUSERS BEHIND

HARRIS CAMPAIGN. TONIGHT SHE TOLD THIS CROWD IN
WISCONSIN, THE FIRST NIGHT OF HER CAMPAIGN RALLY, SHE SAID I AM A PROSECUTOR, HE'S A CRIMINAL.
SHE SAID I KNOW HIS TYPE, HE IS A CHEAT, HE ABUSES WOMEN, GOING
TO PROSECUTE HIM AND WIN THIS
ELECTION. IN THAT REALM OF SORT OF I AM A PROSECUTOR, SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE PROSECUTED DRUG CARTELS, AND THIS IDEA THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN, FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP, IS SAYING SHE WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH, AND SHE'S THE REASON WHY THE BORDER IS
CHAOTIC SHE WAS PUSHING HARD ON THAT SAYING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WASN'T REALLY TAKING THE
ACTION BEHIND HIS WORDS. HE WAS TALKING THE BIG GAME NOT TALKING IT.
SAYING THAT ON DAY ONE SHE WOULD GO AFTER PRICE GOUGING. IT UNDERSCORES THE THESIS OF
THE CAMPAIGN. >> WE CAN LET YOU GO WITHOUT ASKING DEVELOPMENT ON THE VEEP
STAKES. >> GOVERNOR ROY COOPER HAS WITHDRAWN HIS NAME FROM CONSIDERATION. HE WAS A CONSIDERATION, BUT MY

OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY ARE NOW BEING FOUND TO ALSO HELP PREVENT
ALZHEIMER'S. NOW THIS DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THEY GO HAND IN HAND, SO HOW
DOES THIS WORK? DR. SYAL?
>> WE ARE LEARNING IT CAN PROTECT THE HEART AND KIDNEYS.
WE TALKED THAT SMOKING ADDICTION, TODAY, IT'S
ALZHEIMER'S, IT MAY SLOW COGNITIVE DECLINE IN ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS. THE WAY WE THINK THIS MIGHT WORK
, THERE'S LOWER INFLAMMATION IN THE BRAIN. SOME CHANGES ARE NOT THAT DIFFERENT WHAT WE SEE IN
ALZHEIMER'S THAT CAUSES CERTAIN AREAS OF THE BRAIN TO SHRINK.
WE ARE LEARNING OUT MORE, BUT I
DON'T THINK THIS IS TERRIBLY SURPRISING. WE KNOW OBESITY IS A FULL RISK FACTOR FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE,
AND EFFECT IT MAY PROTECT THE
BRAIN, I THINK IT'S PROMISING, BUT I THINK A LOT MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE.
>> MANY ARE ON THESE TYPES OF MEDICATIONS, SO TO BE CLEAR, THIS IS NOT A PREVENTATIVE DRUG, RIGHT? >> NO, NO. WE'VE TALKED AT LENGTH ON THE
SHORTAGES OF THESE DRUGS FOR THOSE WHO ARE DIABETIC AND REALLY NEED THESE MEDICATIONS VERSUS PEOPLE TAKING THEM FOR
REASONS THAT MAY BE UNCLEAR. DON'T GO GET THIS TO YOUR
ALZHEIMER'S. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS DRUG IS GETTING IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO ARE DIABETIC WERE
OBESE, WHO ARE TAKING THEM FOR FDA-APPROVED REGENT REASONS.
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS HAS YET TO BE PEER-REVIEWED, BUT WHAT KIND OF IMPACTS COULD
THIS POTENTIALLY HAVE ON ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH, AND HOW SOON? >> THEY ARE DESPERATE FOR THESE
TREATMENTS. WE TALKED ABOUT THESE MEDICATIONS THAT TARGET THE BRAIN. IT'S QUITE UNCLEAR HOW
THEY ARE WORKING IN THE REAL WORLD. WE KNOW THEY CAN HAVE SCARY SIDE EFFECTS, LIKE RAIN BLEEDING. PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE FOR
TREATMENT. I THINK THIS IS A PROMISING AVENUE. WE ARE EXPECTING CLINICAL TRIALS AS SOON AS NEXT
YEAR. IF THOSE GO WELL WE ARE EXPECTING THIS IN THE NEXT
TRIALS, THAT THIS MAY PROTECT CELLS IN THE BRAIN, AND WE ARE
AWAITING THESE TRIALS TO FIND OUT MORE. >> I AM SURE PEOPLE WILL BE
WAITING TO FIND OUT MORE. DR. SYAL, THANK YOU.
>>> TO SCROLL OR NOT TO SCROLL? CAN THESE TEENAGERS PUT AWAY
THEIR PHONE FOR AN HOUR? NOW. >> THE COUNTDOWN HAS BEGUN.
Teens go on phone 'fast'
>> NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW.
>>> TIME FOR THE FUTURE OF EVERYTHING. WE ALL KNOW YOU CAN'T USUALLY FIND GEN Z AND JANELLE FOR
WITHOUT A PHONE IN THEIR HANDS, BUT SOMETIMES TOO MUCH SCROLLING CAN BE UNHEALTHY.
MORE ON THE IMPACT OF SMART
PHONES AND SOCIAL MEDIA ON TEENAGE MENTAL HEALTH. THEY TOOK A PHONE FAST FOR A WHOLE WEEK. MORE NOW ON THE RESULTS. >> Reporter: TO HEAR THIS
GROUP OF MIDDLE SCHOOL GIRLS TALK ABOUT THEIR PHONES IS AS DIZZYING AS THE SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDS THEY SCROLL.
>> I JUST NEED TO GET ON MY PHONE. IT'S SO ADDICTING.
EXPECT TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS RESPONDED. >> I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT WHAT
EVERYBODY THINKS. YOU DON'T REALLY GET. >> Reporter: TRACKING THE NEVER- ENDING RUSH OF TEXTS, PICTURES,
POSTS, AND LIKES, BUT THEIR PARENTS ARE UNEASY ABOUT THE TEENAGE SMART PHONE ELATION SHIP.
>> I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BOTHERS ME WHEN I SEE MY KIDS ON THE DEVICES IS WHAT ELSE COULD THEY BE DOING?
THEY ARE OFTEN MAY BE IN THE ROOM BY THEMSELVES, AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A LONELY PLACE TO
BE. >> HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE GOTTEN A TEXT THAT MAKES YOU FEEL
DEPRESSED? >> LIKE I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF MY REPUTATION.
>> Reporter: SMARTPHONES HITTING THESE GIRLS SO HARD THEY DECIDED TO PARTICIPATE IN A WEEK-LONG EXPERIMENT . >> I'M DOING THIS, BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE, LIKE, WAS GOING TO
BE DIFFERENT ABOUT ME AT THE END OF THIS. >> Reporter: SO THEY POWERED DOWN AND PUT THE DEVICES IN
PAPER BAGS, NOT TO BE SEEN FOR SEVEN DAYS. >> THIS IS AN ISSUE EVERY
FAMILY IS CONCERNED ABOUT. >> Reporter: THEIR COLLECTIVE
EXPERIENCE GOING ON A PHONE FAST IS SOMETHING ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED AND ONE OF THE SUMMER'S HOTTEST BOOKS FOR PARENTS, THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER, THE ANXIOUS
GENERATION. ZACH RAUCH IS THE BOOK'S CHIEF RESEARCHER, THAT THERE IS A WAVE OF ANXIETY, TRIPLING ER
VISITS FOR TEENS THAT BEGAN AROUND 2010 RIGHT WHEN THE SMART PHONE BECAME UBIQUITOUS.
>> WHEN WE MOVED OUR SOCIAL LIVES TO PHONES, UPWARDS OF SEVEN HOURS A DAY ON SOCIAL
MEDIA SITES ON TIKTOK,
SNAPSHOT, INSTAGRAM, IT IS NOT A SUITABLE PLACE TO GROW UP. >> Reporter: UC IRVINE
DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST CANDACE ROGERS SAYS IT MAY BE IN BOTH TO BLAME SCREENS FOR THE
MODERN ILLS OF TEENS, BUT SHE SAYS THE DATA IS NOT CONCLUSIVE. NATIONAL ACADEMIES OF SCIENCES ISSUED THIS CONSENSUS STUDY BUT FOUND THE LITERATURE DID NOT
SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT SOCIAL MEDIA CAUSES CHANGES IN ADOLESCENT HEALTH. >> THE MESSAGE IS BEING SENT TO
THE PUBLIC THAT THERE IS A CONSENSUS THAT SOCIAL MEDIA, SMART PHONES, ARE UNIFORMLY
DAMAGING AND HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR KIDS. BUT, THAT'S NOT WHAT THE SCIENCE SAYS.
>> Reporter: WHAT DO THESE TEENAGERS SAY? ON THE DAY THEY RECEIVED THEIR DEVICES BACK THEY WERE SMILING AND SINGING TAYLOR SWIFT. WE ASKED WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE
WITHOUT A PHONE FOR A FULL WEEK. >> I DID SO MANY THINGS, LIKE I
DID MY HOMEWORK, THEN I WOULD SCROLL ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THREE HOURS.
>> I WAS WITH MY SISTER OUTSIDE, AND I DID READ LIKE,
TWO BOOKS. >> Reporter: LET'S BE CLEAR, ALL OF THESE TEENS WERE
ECSTATIC TO GET THEIR PHONES BACK, BUT AFTER THEY CHECKED ALL THOSE UNANSWERED MESSAGES,
UNIFORMLY, THEY SAID THEY FELT THAT HER HAVING TAKEN AN EXTENDED BREAK FROM THEIR
SCREENS. >> I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON MY PHONE.
>> IT MADE ME REALIZE HOW BORING IT IS TO JUST SCROLL ON SOCIAL MEDIA ALL DAY.
>> I FELT LIKE I GOT BETTER SLEEP. >> I FEEL LIKE I COULD DO IT FOR LONGER, BECAUSE IT FEELS
REALLY GOOD. >> Reporter: THE PARENTS NOTICED A DIFFERENCE AS WELL, THEIR KIDS READ MORE AND TALKED
MORE, THEY JUST SEEMED MORE CONTENT. >> SHE WAS JUST DOING THINGS,
SHE WAS PRESENT.
>> Reporter: FOR THAT GROUP OF TEENS GOING ON A PHONE FAST WAS MOSTLY A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE, BUT THAT WAS ONLY A WEEK.
MANY DISTRICTS ARE CONSIDERING BANNING PHONES FOR ALL COMING SCHOOL YEAR'S TO MODEL GENERATION TEXT MORE THAN 500
PRINCIPALS AND VICE PRINCIPALS WEIGH IN ON SMART PHONES. THEY TOLD US THEY ARE MAKING STUDENTS DEPRESSED, MAKING THEM
TIRED, AND THEY ARE MAKING BULLYING A BIGGER PROBLEM, THAT, AND MUCH MORE IN OUR EXCLUSIVE SURVEY OF SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS TOMORROW NIGHT.
>>> WE WANT TO GO BACK TO PARIS
FOR THE LATEST ON THE 2024 OLYMPICS, THE USA IN THE LEAD
SO FAR AT 26 MEDALS. FRANCE NOT FAR BEHIND WITH 18, CHINA, WITH 14. WE TOLD YOU LAST NIGHT ABOUT CONCERNS ABOUT THE SEINE RIVER.
E. COLI WAS IN FACT AN ISSUE TODAY FOR THE MEN'S TRIATHLON DELAYED, ORGANIZERS SAY THEY WILL TRY AGAIN TOMORROW.
Simone Biles becomes most decorated U.S. gymnast ever
THE BIGGEST THRILLS CAME FROM U.S. WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS TEAM
CLAIMING GOLD AS SIMONE BILES IS NOW THE MOST DECORATED OLYMPIC GYMNAST IN U.S. HISTORY. OUR VERY OWN GADI SCHWARTZ WAS THERE.
WHAT IS THE EXCITEMENT LEVEL LIKE GADI? >> Reporter: WE JUST GOT BACK
FROM AN EPIC SHOWDOWN. TEAM USA DOMINATING IN GYMNASTICS. WE GOT TO SEE THE GREAT SIMONE
BILES LEADING THE TEAM TO THAT GOLD MEDAL. AND THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS I
WANT TO DESCRIBE YOU CAN'T REALLY CAPTURE ON CAMERA.
ALL MY FRIENDS I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH BACK AT HOME, THERE WERE THESE MOMENTS. AND WHEN SUNI TAKES THE FLOOR,
SHE STICKS THE LANDING AND HAS THIS LITTLE FLARE, THIS LITTLE THING SHE DOES WITH HER HANDS, AND EVERYBODY GOES ABSOLUTELY INSANE FOR IT.
THE ENTIRE PLACE, I MEAN, STANDING OVATIONS WHEN THEY WON GOLD. SO MANY COUNTRIES WERE THERE TO
CELEBRATE GREATNESS AS WE SAW IT.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I KNOW IF
THE CAMERAS COULD GET, AT THE BALANCE BEAM, BUT THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL, ABOUT 12 YEARS OLD, SHE WAS HOLDING A SIGN AS TEAM USA WAS KILLING IT, AND IT
SAID, "TRAN12, YOU ARE MY IDOL,
SUNI ." THAT WAS JUST ONE OF
THE VENUES. AND THE VENUES HERE ARE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. WE ALSO SAW END IN THE GRAND
PALAIS, IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE A
GLADIATOR, THE WORDS OF KING LOUIS, YOU HAVE THESE TWO MEETING AND FACING OFF IN THIS
DUAL. THAT WAS SOMETHING TO BEHOLD THAT WAS AROUND THE 1900s DURING THE EXPOSITION, THERE IS
SO MUCH RICH HISTORY IN PARIS, AND TODAY OBVIOUSLY THE BIG STORY WAS THE HEAT.
IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE 35, 36 DEGREES, WHICH IS CELSIUS.
WE DID OME CONVERSION, I THINK IT WAS AROUND 102 DEGREES.
NOW PARKOUR IS NOT AN A LIP
EXPORT, YET, BUT IN 2028 WHEN WE GO TO LOS ANGELES.

AND WE GOT A CRASH COURSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HEAT WAVE. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY EPIC.
SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE ADVENTURES WE'VE HAD HERE. WE CAN'T WAIT TO SHARE MORE OF THEM. >> WOW. YOU HAD A BUSY DAY.
THANKS FOR THAT ROUNDUP. WE WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW. UNTIL THEN, STAY TUNED NOW.
