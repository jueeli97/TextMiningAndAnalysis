>> MAKING ITS DEBUT AT THE
PARIS GAMES THIS SUMMER AS AN
OLYMPIC SPORT BREAKING, AKA, BREAK DANCING. IF YOU'RE LIKE
ME, WHEN I FIRST TURNED UP AT THIS, YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING
RIGHT NOW, HOW ON EARTH DO YOU KEEP SCORE IN BREAK DANCING?
SO FLIGHT WE BREAK DOWN BREAKING.
WE'RE BREAKING COMING FROM. WELL, IT'S ABOUT A HALF A
CENTURY OLD STARTED IN THE 1970'S IN THE SOUTH BRONX TOOK
OFF LIKE WILDFIRE FROM THEIR SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD STREET
BATTLES, PROFESSIONAL COMPETITIONS. AND NOW BREAKING
IS ON THE BIGGEST STAGE OF THEM ALL IN THE OLYMPICS. 16 MEN AND
16 WOMEN THERE. COLD BE BOYS IN BE GIRLS ARE GOING TO COMPETE
FOR THE FIRST EVER MEDALS IN OLYMPIC BREAKING.
ALL RIGHT. BREAKING COMPETITIONS ARE KNOWN AS
BATTLES THEIR ONE-ON-ONE EACH BREAKER TRYING TO SCORE POINTS
WITH THE JUDGES AND THEY GO BEST OF 3
IN THE BATTLES. THE BREAKERS TAKE TURNS WHEN ONE OF THEM
FINISHES THEIR ROUTINE. THE POINT THE MEDIA LEE BEGINS.
THERE'S EACH OF THESE INDIVIDUAL ROUNDS WITHIN THE
BATTLE IS CALLED A THROWDOWN. EACH ONE LASTS ONE MINUTE.
ONE SKILL OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE HERE IS
IMPROVISATION BECAUSE THIS ISN'T LIKE FIGURE SKATING OR
GYMNASTICS. TEAM BREAKERS DO NOT KNOW AHEAD OF TIME, WHAT
MUSIC THEY'RE GOING TO BE DANCING TO.
ALL RIGHT NOW, HOW THE COMPETITION WORKS FOR THIS ON
BOTH THE MEN'S AND WOMEN'S SIDE, 16 BREAKERS HAVE
QUALIFIED TO COMPETE AT THE GAMES. NO 16 ARE GOING TO BE
SPLIT INTO 4 GROUPS IN THIS IS ROUND ROBIN STYLE. THAT MEANS
THAT EACH BREAKER IS GOING TO HAVE A BATTLE WITH THE OTHER 3
BREAKERS IN THEIR GROUP. TOP 2 FROM EACH GROUP WITH ALL
OF THAT IS OVER WILL ADVANCE TO THE KNOCKOUT PHASE. AND HERE
IT'S ONE BATTLE AT A TIME. HE EITHER WIND EVENTS OR YOU GO
HOME SEE HAVE 8 WHICH QUICKLY BECOMES FOR WHICH QUICKLY
BECOMES TOO. IN THAT FINAL BATTLE. THE ULTIMATE BATTLE,
THE WINTER TAKES HOME. THE GOLD.
IT WAS MOVED TO THE BREAKERS CAN MAKE. BUT ALL OF THOSE MOVE
CAN BASICALLY BE GROUPED INTO 4 THE MAIN ELEMENTS. THIS IS
CALLED TOP ROCK. THEN YOU'VE GOT DOWN ROCK,
CHECK THIS ONE OUT. POWER MOVES. AND FINALLY, YOU'VE GOT
REASONS.
TOP ROCK REFERS TO THE MOVES. THAT BREAKERS DO WELL. THEY ARE
STANDING MOST BREAKING ROUND. START IN TOP. ROCKETS WERE
BREAKERS ESTABLISH THEIR PERSONALITY AND THEIR CHARISMA
DOWN. ROCK IS THE PART OF BREAKING ITS PERFORMED ON THE
FLOOR USING HANDS AND FEET. POWER MOVES ARE THE BIGGER LAST
YEAR. MOVES THAT ARE MORE TECHNICALLY DIFFICULT TO PULL
OFF. THINGS LIKE WIND MILLS AND SPINS
FREEZES INVOLVED PERFORMING A TOTAL STOP IN DIFFICULT TO HOLD
POSITIONS. THIS IS OFTEN USED AS A PUNCTUATION AFTER FAST
MOVEMENTS.
THE KEY TO VICTORY IN BREAKING IS TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM A
VARIETY OF MOVES FROM ALL 4 OF THESE ELEMENTS. THERE ARE
JUDGES IN BREAKING AND THE JUDGES ARE ASSIGNING SCORES TO
EACH BREAKER IN 5 DISTINCT CATEGORIES. EACH ONE OF THESE
CATEGORIES IS WEIGHTED THE COOL. YOU'VE GOT TECHNIQUE.
YOU'VE GOT VOCABULARY. YOU'VE GOT EXECUTION. YOU'VE GOT
MUSICALITY IN THE 5TH ONE ORIGINALITY. ALL RIGHT. SO 5
CATEGORIES AGAIN, EACH 20% OF THE BREAKERS. FINAL SCORE.
AT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE, THIS IS WHAT THE JUDGES ARE
LOOKING AT. THEY'VE GOT AN IPAD WITH THIS. THE 5 CATEGORIES
HERE IN THEY'VE GOT A SLIDER FOR EACH ONE OF THOSE
CATEGORIES AND THERE'S AN OVERALL SLIDER THAT COMBINES
THEM ALL AT THE TOP. AND LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THIS WORKS.
AS THE COMPETITION IS UNFOLDING. THE JUDGE IS MOVING
THAT SLIDER ROUNDS BREAKER, ONE DOING BETTER ON VOCABULARIES,
BREAK OR 2 DOING BETTER ON ORIGINALITY. SO THEY MOVE
AROUND. YOU TAKE THE BALANCE OF THAT AND IT'S REFLECTED UP
HERE. THIS IS THE OVERALL SCORE AND YOU CAN SEE IN THIS JUDGES
SCORING BREAK OR TO BEACH BREAKER ONE.
SO THERE IT IS. THAT'S HOW BREAKING IS GOING TO WORK AT
THE OLYMPICS. STAY TUNED FOR MORE BREAKDOWNS OF SOME OF THE
GAMES AND DON'T MISS SOME OF THESE BREAKING BATTLES IN
PARIS.
