and today I'm calling for three bold
reforms to Restort trust and
accountability to the court and our
democracy as a press shout to me as I
got off Air Force One the Republican
Speaker of the House said whatever he
proposes is Dead on
Arrival why I think is thinking is Dead
on
Arrival
first I'm calling for a con
Amendment called no one is above the law
Amendment it
holds I mean it sincerely it holds there
no immunity for crimes former president
committed wild office I
share our Founders
belief that president must answer to the
law the president is accountable in the
exercise of the great power of the
presidency We're a nation of laws not
Kings and
dictators the decision can be boiled
down to the title of one case Trump
versus the United States a
court asserted it was making a ruling
for the ages that isn't true the court
made a ruling for one a former president
no other president our history has asked
for this kind of immunity for criminal
actions and no president no former
president not me not one not
one has in should have been given given
any exception to this with such
immunity the second thing I'm asking for
we've had term term limit for presiden
of the United States for nearly 75 years
after the Truman
Administration and I believe we should
have term Li for Supreme Court trusts of
the United States as
[Applause]
well in fact the United States is the
only major constitutional democracy it
gives lifetime seats in their High Court
term limits would help ensure that the
court membership changes with some
regularity that would be make timing for
the Court's nomination more predictable
and less arbitrary reduce the chance
that any single president imposes undo
influence in generations to come the
bipartisan commission I comman analyz
various term limit structures based on
their report I believe the best
structure is the 18-year term limit that
would help ensure the country would not
have what it has now an extreme Court
that's Sur proud of an attack on the
confir process that's been weaponized by
those seeking to carry out an extreme
agenda for decades to come by the way
these guys mean
it these guys mean
it project 2025 is real they mean
it third I'm calling for binding code of
conduct for the Supreme Court
Supreme Court's current ethics code is
weak and even more frightening voluntary
voluntary any code of Congress must be
enforcable under the reform I propos
Justice would be required to disclose
gifts refrain from public political
activity recuse themselves in cases in
which they have they or their spouses
have a financial or other conflict of
interest
most people don't
realize that Congress passed the law
decades ago that says all federal judges
including Supreme Court justices have to
recuse themselves in such cases but the
current justices
insist on enforcing that requirement
themselves without any public oversight
or
compulsion see that's their decision
they don't have to tell us how they made
it that might work the court was
actually enforcing those requirements
but they are
not the court is not self-policing the
court is not dealing with the obvious
conflicts of interest we need a
mandatory code of ethics for the Supreme
Court and we need it
now my fellow
Americans based on all my experience I'm
certain we need these reforms we need
these reforms to restore trust in the
courts preserve the system of checks and
balances that are vital to our
democracy there're also Common Sense
reforms that a vast majority of the
American people support as well as
leading constitutional law Scholars
