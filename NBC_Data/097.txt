I SUPPOSE THAT'S BETTER THAN
WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS HARD
FEELINGS ABOUT CATS.
>> GARRETT HAAKE.
GARRETT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
AND JOINING ME NOW, JUDY, SHE'S
THE -- TANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
JOINING US.
AS WE MENTIONED, REPUBLICANS
ARE TRYING TO DEFINE HER TO
VOTERS BEFORE SHE CAN.
TAKE A LISTEN AT SOME OF AN AD
RELEASED BY DAVE McCORMICK.
SMIT PREPARED TO GET RID OF THE
FILIBUSTER.
>> THERE'S NO QUESTION.
SMIT WOULD YOU BAN OFFSHORE
DRILLING?
>> YES.
>> WE NEED TO PROBABLY THINK
ABOUT STARTING FROM SCRATCH.
>> IT IS WRONG TO THINK THAT
THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MAKE
COMMUNITY SAFER IS BY PUTTING
MORE OFFICERS ON THE STREET.
>> DO YOU THINK SHE WILL HAVE
TO STEP AWAY FROM SOME OF THE
POSITIONS?
OR WILL SOME OF THAT STUFF JUST
BE UNPOPULAR WITH VOTERS?
>> I THINK KAMALA HARRIS'
RECORD STANDS FOR ITSELF.
SHE WILL EXPLAIN WHAT SHE MEANT
BY EACH OF THE STATEMENTS.
BUT ONE THING I CAN SAY, SHE
HAS BEEN A LEADER ON KEY ISSUES.
WHETHER IT'S REPRODUCTIVE
RIGHTS, OR ADDRESSING GUN
VIOLENCE, OR ADDRESSING CLIMATE
CHANGE. WHETHER IT'S MAKING
SURE WE WERE LOOSED -- REDUCED
THE PRICE OF INSULIN.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK VOTERS WILL
PAY ATTENTION TO.
>> IS SHE THE STRONGEST
CANDIDATE DEMOCRATS CAN RUN
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AT THIS
MOMENT?
>> SHE IS THE STRONGEST
CANDIDATE BY FAR.
SHE IS OUR VICE PRESIDENT.
SHE'S BEEN THERE WITH PRESIDENT
BIDEN ON KEY DECISION-MAKING
TIMES.
AND WITH KEY ISSUES.
SHE HAS SHOWN THAT SHE CAN GO
NOT ONLY ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY
TO TALK ABOUT SUCH ISSUES, BUT
ALSO HAS GONE ABROAD AND HAS
REPRESENTED THE U.S. IN OVER 20
COUNTRIES, INCLUDING IN THE
WORLDWIDE CLIMATE SUMMIT THAT
OCCURRED AT DUBAI.
SO SHE HAS SHOWN SHE CAN MEET
THE TEST TO BE A GOOD LEADER,
IF NOT GREAT LEADER FOR ALL OF
AMERICA.
>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT A
HARRIS COALITION LOOKS LIKE.
DO YOU BELIEVE SHE CAN BRING
THE SAME ENTHUSIASM TO OTHER
MINORITIES QUICK THE I KNOW
VOTERS ARE GROWING THERE.
THE THING SHE CAN MOTIVATE SOME
OF THOSE OTHER GROUPS?
>> ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN ON
SEVERAL CALLS FOR HARRIS THIS
PAST WEEK. PEOPLE ARE WILDLY
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT KAMALA
HARRIS' CANDIDACY.
AND I DO NOT THINK -- SHE WILL
BE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR NUMBERS
THERE.
LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE
POPULATION IN GEORGIA IS REALLY
GROWING.
AND IN THE 2020 CAMPAIGN, ABLE
TO REGISTER 30,000 NEW VOTERS,
AND PRESIDENT BIDEN WON BY JUST
12,000 VOTES.
THE NH PIS HAVE BEEN
MARGINALIZED TO VICTORY.
>> THE THING VICE PRESIDENT
HARRIS AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET
BOLSTERS YOUR CHANCES OF TAKING
BACK THE HOUSE, AND PERHAPS
HOLDING THE SENATE.
SMIT ACTUALLY, PEOPLE WERE
VERY, VERY CONCERNED AS TO
WHETHER IT MIGHT BE A DRAG TO
LOWER BALLAD RACES.
AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE
KAMALA HARRIS' CANDIDACY, THAT
THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN
INCREASING, AND THAT PEOPLE ARE
SO MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT
BEING ABLE TO WIN THESE SEATS
TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE.
YOU KNOW, WE ONLY NEED A NET
FOUR SEATS TO TAKE BACK THE
HOUSE.
THE NUMBERS FOR THESE
CANDIDATES IS RISING.
MET WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT
STILL CONSIDERING HER VP PICK,
WHO WOULD BE THE BEST CHOICE?
HOW MUCH OF THIS DECISION
SHOULD BE ABOUT THE ELECTORAL
MAP VERSUS CHEMISTRY?
AND THEY HAVE CALLED THE MOST
IMPORTANT FACTOR.
>> I THINK THIS IS A DECISION
THAT I TRUST KAMALA HARRIS WILL
MAKE TO THE BEST OF HER ABILITY.
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS WINNING
IN A BATTLEGROUND STATE THAT
WILL ENSURE THAT SHE WINS THE
PRESIDENCY.
CHEMISTRY IS A LARGE PART OF
IT.
I THINK THE ABILITY IS OF THE
UTMOST IMPORTANCE.
>> SO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE TOP
PRIORITY FOR YOU.
AND YOU THINK THAT SHOULD
REALLY ENTER INTO THE KEY
BATTLEGROUND STATES?
SOMEONE THAT CAN HELP DELIVER
THEM.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
AND I THINK THEY ARE CERTAINLY
IN THE LEAD BECAUSE OF THOSE
FACTORS.
SMACKING QUICKLY,
CONGRESSWOMAN, TO TALK ABOUT
THE ISSUE OF ABORTION.
IOWA BECAME THE LATEST STATE TO
IMPLEMENT AN ABORTION BAN.
HOW KIRCHER WITH THE ISSUE OF
ABORTION BE TO DEMOCRATS'
CHANCES IN NOVEMBER?
>> I BELIEVE THAT ABORTION IS
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE.
I BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY THAT
ARE JUST SO TOTALLY DISTRAUGHT
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE
DECISION.
AND THE IOWA BAN ONLY MAKES IT
MUCH WORSE.
ACTUALLY WITH IOWA, WE HAVE 22
STATES THAT HAVE IN ESSENCE,
BAND ABORTION.
IT IS CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO
TURN THIS AROUND.
RIGHT NOW, YOUNG WOMEN HAVE
LESS RIGHTS THAN THEIR
GRANDMOTHER DID.
WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WOMEN
CAN MAKE THE CHOICES THEY NEED
ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES, THEIR
FUTURES, AND NOT THE POLITICS
