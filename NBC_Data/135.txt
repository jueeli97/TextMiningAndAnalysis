PLOTTING THE TERROR ATTACKS NOW
AGREED TO PLEAD GUILTY.
WE HAVE OUR PENTAGON
CORRESPONDED TO EXPLAIN HOW WE
GOT HERE NEARLY 23 YEARS LATER.
>>> THE NO WARNING AFTER THE
KILLING OF A HAMAS LEADER IN
ITS CAPITAL.
THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENS FROM HERE.
>>> THE MARATHON TRIAL OF YOUNG
THUG TAKING A NEW AND WHILE
TWIST . MORE ON THE ACCUSATIONS
OF ANOTHER SECRET MEETING THAT
HAS THE DEFENSE CALLING FOR A
MISTRIAL.
>>> WE ARE GOING TO START WITH
BREAKING NEWS.
THE PENTAGON ANNOUNCING THAT
THREE MEN ACCUSED OF PLOTTING
THE TERROR ATTACK IN THE UNITED
STATES HAVE REACHED PLEA
AGREEMENTS IN THE MILITARY
COMMISSIONS PROCESS.
I WANT TO BRING AN HOUR
PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT COVERING
THIS FOR US.
WHAT DO WE KNOW AND WHAT HAS
HAPPENED?
>> THE MEN ACCUSED OF PLOTTING
THE 9/11 ATTACKS.
MAYBE NOT NAMES REVIEWERS WOULD
BE FAMILIAR WITH. HE IS ONE OF
THE CASES THAT GOT A LOT MORE
ATTENTION IN THE DAYS AFTER.
YOU CAN SEE HIS PICTURE ON THE
SCREEN.
ALL THREE MEN HAVE BEEN HELD
OVER 20 YEARS AND DURING A
LARGE PORTION OF THE TIME FOR
YEARS NOW THEIR ATTORNEYS HAVE
BEEN WORKING WITH THE MILITARY
COMMISSION PROCESS TO TRY TO
COME TO SOME SORT OF A PLEA
AGREEMENT THAT WHAT WE JUST
LEARNED MOMENTS AGO IS THEY
HAVE REACHED THAT.
THIS IS THE MILITARY
COMMISSIONS PROCESS.
IT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN A
NORMAL OR REGULAR COURT AS I
KNOW IT. BASICALLY THEIR
ATTORNEYS INDEPENDENCE
THEMSELVES WITH SIT DOWN WITH
WHAT IS CALLED A CONVENING
AUTHORITY.
SORT OF LIKE A COURT
ADMINISTRATOR.
SOME OF THE POWERS OF THE
JUDGE.
THROUGH MANY MONTHS THEY HAVE
BEEN DISCUSSING THESE POSSIBLE
PLEAS AND HAVE COME TO ONE.
WE DO NOT KNOW THE DETAILS
THOUGH.
GENERALLY BECAUSE ALL THREE MEN
WERE CHARGED WITH CRIMES THAT
WOULD COME WITH THE DEATH
PENALTY GENERALLY IN A PLEA
AGREEMENT LIKE THIS THEY WOULD
COME TO SOME SORT OF A DEAL TO
PLEAD GUILTY TO CHARGES THAT
WOULD BE JUST LESS THAN THAT
WOULD YIELD LESS THAN THE
POSSIBILITY OF DEATH PENALTY.
THAT IS WHAT WE BELIEVE
HAPPENED HERE.
ALL THREE ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN
COURT AT GUANTAâ– AMO BAY AS
EARLY AS NEXT WEEK, BUT WE
DON'T EXPECT ANY SENTENCING TO
BE UNTIL SOMETIME NEXT YEAR, SO
WE STILL WON'T KNOW FOR SOME
TIME EXACTLY WHAT THIS MEANS AS
THE NEXT STEPS
