POLITICAL SUCKER PUNCH
ACCORDING TO A REPORTING

VANCE ADDING HARRIS IS YOUNGER
AND NOT STRUGGLING IN THE SAME
WAY PRESIDENT BIDEN DID.
A SPOKESPERSON SAID HARRIS' FAR

THAT TOPIC OF THE BORDER AND
IMMIGRATION.

WANT TO SEE HARRIS ACCOMPLISH
THAT YOU HAVE NOT?

>>> IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, ONE
OF THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN
STATE HISTORY IS STILL GROWING
AT A RAPID PACE.
DEVASTATED FAMILIES ARE
RETURNING TO FIND HOMES TURNED
TO ASH.
STEVE PATTERSON IS IN CHICO,
CALIFORNIA WITH THE LATEST.
>> Reporter: THE FIRE WILL NOT
STOP GROWING.
LESS THAN A WEEK, 370,000
ACRES, THE LARGEST ACTIVE
WILDFIRE BURNING ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.
THE SIXTH LARGEST FIRE IN
CALIFORNIA HISTORY.
FIREFIGHTERS BATTLING THE PARK
FIRE, HOPING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF COLDER WEATHER TO INCREASE
CONTAINMENT OF THIS MASSIVE
BLAZE.
THOUSANDS ARE UNDER EVACUATION
ORDERS AND DOZENS OF HOMES
DESTROYED ALONG WITH COUNTLESS
CLOSE CALLS.

GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE.
I DECIDED TO STAY AND HAD A
COUPLE PEOPLE WITH ME. WE KNOW

START IN THE WILDFIRE APPEARING
IN COURT FOR THE FIRST TIME,
FACING FELONY ARSON CHARGES.

TOWN.
NEARLY TRIPPING TWO SHERIFF'S
DEPUTIES.

FIRE.
>> Reporter: THANKFULLY, THE
OFFICERS SURVIVED.
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, MUCH OF
THE BURNED ZONE COVERS AREAS
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY
WILDFIRES INCLUDING PARADISE,
CALIFORNIA, WHERE 85 PEOPLE
DIED IN 2018.
AMID THE DEVASTATION, MOMENTS
OF JOY.
THESE PUPPIES AND THEIR MOTHER
STUCK WHEN THEIR OWNER'S TRUCK
WERE RESCUED BY THE SHERIFFS.
A SMALL VICTORY AS THE WAR
AGAINST WILDFIRES REACHES AN.
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WEATHER
HAS BEEN COOPERATIVE FOR
FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE ALSO
MAKING PROGRESS ON FIRE
CONTAINMENT.
NOW UP TO 14% AND THEY ARE
PUSHING AWAY POPULATION CENTERS
AND AWAY FROM THIS CITY AND THE
TOWN OF PARADISE.
THERE IS MORE HOT, DRY WEATHER
IN THE FORECAST FURTHER
ELEVATING THE FIRE DANGER AND A DANGEROUS FIREFIGHT.
STATIC METEOROLOGIST AND --
STATIC METEOROLOGIST AND --
ANGIE LASSMAN JOINS US.
>>> WE HAVE RAIN TO TALK ABOUT
AND WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT
AS A COLD FRONT WORKS ITS WAY
TO THE EAST.
THESE ARE SPOTS WE'RE SEEING
RAIN.
NOTICE PARTS OF THE MIDWEST,
OHIO VALLEY, BUT WE HAVE A
FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY IN PARTS
OF VERMONT.
CALEDONIA COUNTY WE HAVE SEEN
AMPLE AMOUNTS OF RAIN AND
WASHED OUT ROADS.
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND
THAT RAIN IS MOVING OUT BUT
THEY HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF
RAIN IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.
IS MORE WAY RAIN ON THE WAY.
MAINE TO FLORIDA, SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND STORMS TODAY.
A COUPLE MORE ACROSS PARTS OF
THE MIDWEST AS WE WATCH US COLD
FRONT WORK TO THE EAST.
AS WE GET INTO TOMORROW, ONCE
AGAIN THE SAME UNSETTLED
BEHAVIOR.
THUNDERSTORMS FOCUSED ACROSS
PARTS OF NEW ENGLAND AND MID
ATLANTIC.
THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT TOMORROW,
SEVERE RISK WILL BE LOW BUT WE
WILL HAVE THE HEAVY RAIN
THREAT.
TODAY, A BIG CHUNK OF THE
COUNTRY UNDER THE SEVERE RISK.
18 MILLION FROM OMAHA TO DES
MOINES THROUGH ST. LOUIS AND
EXTENDING FURTHER TO THE NORTH
IN PARTS OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS.
THE BIGGEST THING TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT HIS STRONG
WINDS.
THAT'S THE MAIN THREAT.
THE GREATEST CHANCE OF
HAPPENING, WIND GUSTS OVER 75
MILES PER HOUR.
WILL NOT RULE OUT HAIL
POTENTIALLY, ISOLATED TORNADO.
THE HEAVY RAIN WILL BE THERE.
NOTICE THE SLIGHT RISK OF FLASH
FLOODING FROM DES MOINES TO
KNOXVILLE, CHATTANOOGA, SOME OF
THE SAME AREAS THEY COULD SEE
STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL.
AN INCH TO 2 INCHES ARE UP TO
THREE INCHES.
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE
TROPICS?
THEY'VE BEEN A LITTLE QUIET BUT
WE ARE FAR FROM DONE.
IT'S FAR FROM OVER.
ALL THE WAY TO NOVEMBER AND WE
HAVE A 50% CHANCE OF THIS
TROPICAL DEPRESSION POTENTIALLY
DEVELOPING BY THE END OF THE
WEEK.
THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS SO WE
WON'T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO
THIS HOW THIS PLAYS OUT BUT WE
WILL KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON A.
LOOKING AT THE DEVELOP MOVES ON
ACROSS PARTS OF THE CARIBBEAN
AND UP THE COAST OF FLORIDA
POTENTIALLY THROUGH THE NEXT
WEEK OR SO.
MEANWHILE, THE OLYMPICS, THAT'S
BEEN WHAT EVERYBODY HAS BEEN
FOCUSING ON.
LOOK AT TEMPERATURES IN PARIS.
100 DEGREES, EXTREME HEAT.
THIS WILL LIKELY IMPACT SOME
SPORTS.
VOLLEYBALL AND EQUESTRIAN.
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES LIKELY GOING
TO SEE REALLY WARM TEMPERATURES WITH FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURES
WITH FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURES
110.
LATE AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND
STORMS OUT THERE AS WELL AND
THEY COULD LAST INTO THE
EVENING.
THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS THERE,
THINGS GET BETTER.
TEMPERATURES GETTING BACK TO
CLOSER TO NEAR AVERAGE RANGE
THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK.
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WE WILL GET
RID OF THE RAIN AND HAVE A
LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE FOR FOLKS
COMPETING AND FOLKS ENJOYING
THE OLYMPICS THERE.
>> HOPEFULLY THEY HELD ONTO THE
CLEAR PONCHOS THEY WERE USING
DURING THE CEREMONIES.
>>> TURNING TO THE MIDDLE EAST
WERE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS ARE
INTENSIFYING THEIR TO TRY TO DE-
ESCALATE TENSION BETWEEN ISRAEL
AND HEZBOLLAH.
LEBANON -- THEY SAID IT WOULD
RESPOND TO A ROCKET STRIKE ON
THE ISRAEL CONTROLLED: HEIGHTS
THAT KILLED 12 YOUNG PEOPLE.
INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT RAF
SANCHEZ JOINS US WITH MORE ON
THIS.
WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THIS
ONGOING EFFORT THAT WE HAVE
HEARD ABOUT TO STOP THE
CONFLICT FROM SPREADING DEEPER
INTO LEBANON, AND HOW LIKELY IS
THIS MAJOR ISRAELI ATTACK NOW?
>> Reporter: WE SAW THE ISRAELI
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU ON THE GOLAN HEIGHTS
YESTERDAY.
HE WENT TO VISIT THE SOCCER
FIELD WHERE THE 12 KIDS WERE
KILLED IN WHAT ISRAEL SAYS WAS
A ROCKET STRIKE CARRIED OUT BY
IRANIAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH
MILITANTS.
THE PRIME MINISTER BOWS THERE
WILL BE A SEVERE RESPONSE.
WE DON'T YET KNOW WHAT THAT
LOOKS LIKE, BUT ONE OF THE BIG
QUESTIONS IS, WILL NETANYAHU
GET THE ISRAELI MILITARY THE
ORDER TO ATTACK BEIRUT, THE
CAPITOL OF LEBANON.
THAT IS SOMETHING HE HAS
REFRAINED FROM DOING OVER THESE
LAST 9.5 MONTHS OF WAR BUDDIES
UNDER MAJOR PRESSURE FROM THE
FAR RIGHT OF HIS GOVERNMENT TO
RESPOND IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY.
THE U.S. IS SAYING IT SUPPORTS
ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO RETALIATE BUT
IT'S COUNSELING RESTRAINT.
WE KNOW IT'S BEEN ACTING AS A
GO-BETWEEN, ISRAELI GOVERNMENT,
LEBANESE GOVERNMENT AND BY
EXTENSION HEZBOLLAH TRYING TO
DEATH WE DON'T END UP IN A
CYCLE OF ESCALATION THAT LEADS
TO ALL-OUT WAR.
>> I WANT TO ASK ABOUT ANOTHER
BIG STORY OUT OF ISRAEL WE ARE
FOLLOWING.
WE UNDERSTAND NINE ISRAELI
SOLDIERS EXPECTED OF ABUSING A
PALESTINIAN PRISONER WILL BE IN
COURT TODAY.
YESTERDAY, BACKLASH FROM
PROTESTERS STORMING TWO
MILITARY BASES IN RESPONSE?
WALK US THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED
AND THESE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST
THE SOLDIERS?
>> Reporter: YEAH.
THIS WAS A SPASM OF POLITICAL
MOB VIOLENCE WHICH HAS STUNNED
MANY LIBERAL ISRAELIS.
YESTERDAY, MILITARY POLICE
SHOWED UP AT A NOTORIOUS ISRAELI
DETENTION CENTER WHERE
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS FROM GAZA
ARE BEING HELD.
A CENTER WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN
ALLEGATIONS OF TORTURE BY
ISRAELI AUTHORITIES AND THE
MILITARY POLICE ARRESTED NINE
SOLDIERS WHO ARE SUSPECTED OF
HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN
TORTURE, SERIOUS ABUSE, OF ONE
DETAINEE.
SHORTLY AFTER THAT, YOU SAW
THIS MOB OF RIGHT-WING
ACTIVISTS LED BY SOME ISRAELI
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, AND THEY
STORM THROUGH THE GATES OF THE
FACILITY.
A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER, THE
SAME THING HAPPENED.
THIS TIME THEY WERE STORMING A
ISRAELI ARMY BASE WHERE THOSE
SOLDIERS WERE BEING DETAINED.
THIS HAS LED TO WIDESPREAD
CONDEMNATION FROM ISRAELI
POLITICAL LEADERS, AND WE SAW
THE CHIEF OF STAFF, THE HEAD OF
THE ISRAELI MILITARY SAYING
THIS IS BORDERLINE ANARCHY.
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE
ISRAELI POLICE WHO DID NOT STOP
THE MOB FROM STORMING INTO THE
BASIS.
THEY DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE
CARRIED OUT ANY ARREST.
IS REAL ZONE DEFENSE MINISTER
IS QUESTIONING WHETHER THE FAR
RIGHT NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE POLICE,
GAVE THEM AN ORDER NOT TO
INTERVENE IN THIS SITUATION.
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OR WHEN THE
NATIONAL SECURITY MINISTER IS
DENYING BUT IT'S A STUNNED
ISRAEL AND BRINGING RENEWED
FOCUS ON ALLEGATIONS THAT
ISRAELI FORCES MAY HAVE BEEN
TORTURING SOME OF THESE
DETAINEES.
>> A LOT OF MOVING PARTS IN THE
REGION.
I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT GUYS AND
THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION.
WORSENING YET AGAIN.
HEALTH MINISTRY DECLARING A
POLIO EPIDEMIC?
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
SAID THEY NEED A CEASE-FIRE TO
VACCINATE CHILDREN.
TELL US ABOUT THAT AND IS THERE
UPDATES ON A POTENTIAL CEASE
FIRE?
>> Reporter: YEAH, POLIO.
A DISEASE FROM THE EARLY 20th
CENTURY.
IT IS LARGELY STAMPED OUT
ACROSS MUCH OF THE PLAN I. IT
APPEARS, ACCORDING TO THE WORLD
HEALTH ORGANIZATION, TWO BROKEN
OUT IN GAZA BECAUSE THE HEALTH
CARE SYSTEM HAS COMPLETELY
COLLAPSED.
KIDS HAVE NOT BEEN GETTING
VACCINATIONS.
AS THIS POINT, POLIO HAS BEEN
DETECTED IN WASTEWATER.
WE HAVE NOT SEEN IT IN ANY
ACTIVE PATIENTS.
IT'S RAISING A LOT OF CONCERN
ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN
DEVASTATED -- CEASE-FIRE.
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS
BEEN SOUNDING MORE HOPEFUL ABOUT
A DEAL.
THE CIA DIRECTOR WAS IN ROME
AND MEETING WITH ISRAELI,
EGYPTIAN AND QATARI
COUNTERPARTS.
IS REAL AND THOMAS ARE BLAMING
EACH OTHER AND WE HAVEN'T
REACHED A DEAL.
THEY ARE ACCUSING THE OTHER
TRIED TO MAKE LAST-MINUTE
CHANGES.
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED BY
