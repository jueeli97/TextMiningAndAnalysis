TOP STORE WITH TOM LLAMAS, WEEKNIGHTS AT 7:00 ON NBC NEWS NOW.
>>> VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS SET TO ARRIVE IN BAT AROUND GEORGIA MINUTES FROM NOW.
HER CAMPAIGN HITS THE AIRWAVES FOR THE FIRST TIME, PREPARING TO HIT THE TRAIL WITH THE
RUNNING MATE JUST DAYS FROM NOW. PLUS, NEW REVELATIONS ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON FORMER
PRESIDENT INCLUDING A MOMENT
SHE SAID, QUOTE, MADE ME ASHAMED. A POWERFUL AIRSTRIKE IN LEBANON CAPITOL CITY, TARGETING A
FALLEN COMMANDER.
Harris heads to battleground Georgia for second rally as de facto nominee
WELCOME TO MEET THE PRESS NOW. I AM GABE GUTIERREZ IN WASHINGTON. ON A BUSY DAY IN THE
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.
NEXT 100 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION. RIGHT NOW, JUST HER SECOND
RALLY SINCE LAUNCHING HER OWN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. THE
LOCATION OF TONIGHT'S RALLY SPEAKS VOLUME ABOUT HOW MUCH
THE LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED. IT WAS SLIPPING OUT OF THEIR
REACH HUNTER BIDEN CANDIDACY.
IN ADDITION, THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS ALSO LOOKING TO CHIP AWAY AT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGNS EDGE WITH WHITE VOTERS.
INCLUDING SEVERAL BP CONTENDERS JOINING US STAR-STUDDED ZUNE CALL LAST NIGHT FOR A GROUP
DUBBED WHITE DUDES FOR HARRIS.
>> WHEN I'M INVITED TO A GROUP LIKE THAT, IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING I WOULD GENERALLY
JOIN. BUT THIS IS A GREAT CAUSE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND JD VANCE. HE IS A THREE TIME CONVICTED FELON, A LIAR.
HE IS A FRAUD. JD VANCE IS HIS MINI ME.
>> IT'S CLEAR. NO ONE IS BETTER POSITIONED TO PROSECUTE THAT CASE THAN, HARRIS.
>> WHO WAS ASKING TO BAN BIRTH CONTROL?
WHO'S ASKING TO RAISE THE PRICE OF INSULIN? THE CHOIR NEEDS TO SING.
THIS IS OUR MOMENT. THIS IS TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR SEVERAL GENERATIONS.
>> HARRIS INCHES CLOSER TO SELECTING A RUNNING MATE FROM THE FIELD OF PREDOMINANTLY WHITE DUDES.
IT'S EXPECTED TO WRAP UP JUST DAYS FROM NOW. DECIDING JUST HOW CLOSE THE
CAMPAIGN IS. TWO SOURCES TELL NBC NEWS THAT
SHE AND HER LIKELY RUNNING MATE WILL HIT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL NEXT WEEK. MEANWHILE, THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN ANNOUNCING ITS FIRST MAJOR AD
BOT. A $50 MILLION BLITZ TO REINTRODUCE OR TO THE PUBLIC.
>> AS A PROSECUTOR, SHE PUT MURDERERS AND ABUSERS BEHIND BARS. AS CALIFORNIA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL, SHE WENT AFTER THE BIG
BANKS. AS VICE PRESIDENT, SHE TOOK ON THE BIG DRUG COMPANIES.
>> DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACKWARDS!
GIVING TWO BIG CORPORATIONS AND AND MAKE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT! BUT WE ARE NOT GOING BACK.
>> AFTER TESTING OUT A VARIETY OF ATTACK LINES, THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS OUT TODAY WITH THE MONTH -- MULTIMILLION DOLLAR AD OF THEIR OWN.
>> UNDER HARRIS, OVER 10 MILLION ILLEGALLY HERE. A QUARTER OF AMERICANS DID. AND
ICE IS NOW HERE. KAMALA HARRIS FAILED. >> AND JOINING ME NOW, NBC'S
YAMICHE ALCINDOR IS ON THE GROUNDS. NBC'S ALEX -- IS ALSO COVERING
THE SO-CALLED WHITE DUDES FOR HARRIS. AND NBC'S GARRETT HAAKE IS
HERE. YAMICHE, I WANT TO START WITH
YOU. THIS IS THE FIRST EVENING RALLY SINCE GETTING THE TORCH. WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT FROM HER
TONIGHT? >> Reporter: WE CAN CALL THIS RALLY THE HOT GIRL SUMMER RALLY.
APART FROM HER HEADLINING THIS, WE WILL ALSO THE MEGAN THE STALLION. A LOT OF THE VOTERS
HERE ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS WHO VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS HOPE TURNOUT AND BIG NUMBERS. THIS IS A STATE WHERE FORMER PRESIDENT BIDEN ONLY ONE BY
12,000 VOTES. TRYING TO APPEAL TO AFRICAN- AMERICAN VOTERS.
SPECIFICALLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN. SHE IS HAVING THIS RALLY AS A PRIME TIME RALLY.
REALLY IN SOME WAYS, UNDERSTANDING A NEW PHASE IN HER CAMPAIGN. REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSCORE THE POINT THAT SHE IS TRYING TO
COMPETE WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE AIRWAVES.
I'M TOLD THAT HE'S BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE ECONOMY.
I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH A BUNCH OF SOURCES THAT TELL ME THIS WILL BE A STOCK ISSUE CAMPAIGN,
ROLLING OUT POLICIES ON OUR WEBSITE. IT WILL BE ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE FEEL BETTER. GIVING PEOPLE A
SENSE OF HOPE. ESPECIALLY DURING A POINT WHERE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS
STARTING TO GET OVER THIS.
DROPPING AS THE LIKELY NOMINEE. AND SOMETHING ELSE WE ARE LOOKING AT, WE KNOW THAT ROY COOPER HAS WITHDRAWN.
SOURCES TOLD ME BECAUSE HE WANTS TO RUN FOR THE U.S. SENATE IN 2026. THERE ARE OTHER SORT OF ISSUES HERE.
WE ARE ALSO HEARING THAT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS GETTING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH ONE OF THESE PEOPLE.
THESE ARE THE TOP PEOPLE WE'VE BEEN TRACKING. THEY ARE SET TO HIT BATTLEGROUND STATES NEXT
WEEKEND. THIS IS REALLY TELLS YOU THAT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WILL BE TALKING WITH SOME OF THE SAME
PEOPLE PRESIDENT BIDEN WANTED TO TALK TO, WAS STILL HOPING TO EXPAND OUR CHANGE THAT PATH A LITTLE BIT.
>> YAMICHE, I'M OOKING AT THAT CROWD BEHIND YOU. THE GATHERING CROWD, THE MUSIC.
AND LOOK, SOME OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S RALLIES I'VE BEEN TO PREVIOUSLY WEREN'T EXACTLY THAT LOUD. THEY WERE A LITTLE BUT -- A
LITTLE BIT MORE POLITE. HOW IS THIS KAMALA HARRIS
DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS ENTHUSIASM WE WERE SEEING IN SOME OF THE JOE BIDEN RALLIES? WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? >> THAT IS SUCH A GREAT
QUESTION, GAVE -- D-DAY --
GABE. WHEN HE WAS HOPING TO VOTE FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN, HE WAS REALLY
CONCERNED. NOW HE FEELS LIKE HE'S NEVER SEEN THIS LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM THIS FAST. REMEMBER, WE ARE REALLY ONLY A
WEEK AND ONE DAY INTO THE CAMPAIGN. PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY GATHERED. MILLIONS OF THEM ON ZOOM.
OUR PEOPLE THAT ARE FIRST-TIME VOTERS. PEOPLE ON THE GROUND HERE IN GEORGIA ARE SO IT CITED. A NUMBER ARE TELLING ME THEY ARE ALSO EXCITED TO MAKE
HISTORY. THEY ARE EXCITED TO SEE A BLACK WOMAN, SOUTH -- I CAN EXPECT
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS TO LEAD INTO THAT. THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO KNOCK ON DOORS, DO ALL THE
THINGS IT WILL TAKE TO HELP THEM WIN. >> YAMICHE ALCINDOR, LIVE FOR
US. ALEX, WHILE THE VP HEADS TO ATLANTA TO TALK TO BLACK
VOTERS, AS REPORTED, WHITE DUDES GATHERED YESTERDAY IN HER NAME. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT
QUICK >> YEAH, THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHEEKY EVENT.
IT WAS A STAR-STUDDED ZUNE CALL. KIND OF A THROWBACK TO THE COVID DAYS. A PARADE OF BEIGE, AS ACTOR
BRADLEY WHITFORD PUT IT. MARK KAMEL, WHO PLAYED LUKE
SKYWALKER. JOSH GROBAN, LANCE BASS FROM IN SYNC. JUST A WHOLE BUNCH OF
HOLLYWOOD ROYALTY. IN ADDITION TO ABOUT HALF OF, HARRIS' VP LIST.
RAISING OVER $4 MILLION. IT WAS AN INTERESTING MIX OF
SELF-DEPRECATING JOKES. SAYING BY OUR HATS, NOT THE
TRUCKER HEADS THAT WHITE MEN USUALLY WEAR WHEN THEY COME TOGETHER, MAKING FUN OF THE
CLANS. THE MAJORITY WHO ARE WITH
DONALD TRUMP, THAT'S BEEN THE BACKBONE OF HIS SUPPORT. AND THEY ARE HOPING TO RAISE AWARENESS AS A DEMOGRAPHIC,
WHICH IS NOT REALLY A GROUP WE TALKED ABOUT. IT'S KIND OF BEEN THE DEFAULT. AND IT'S ONE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT PAID ATTENTION TO IN THE
PAST. HARRIS IS NOT GOING TO WIN
WHITE MEN. THAT'S MORE OF TRUMP'S DEMOGRAPHIC.
THERE ARE SO MANY THAT CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND THE MONEY THEY RAISE OUT OF THIS CAR WON'T HURT EITHER.
>> YOU KNOW, SO MUCH OF POLITICS, WE THINK OF POLITICAL RALLIES. THAT'S THE TRADITIONAL WAY TO SENSE VOTER ENTHUSIASM.
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THESE ZOOM MEET UP?
AND DOES THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN EXPECT TO USE THAT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE? MAKE YES, ABSOLUTELY.
ONE OF THE FIRST EVENT THAT HERE IS DID WAS THE ZUNE CALL WITH A BLACK WOMAN THAT JUST
EXPLODED. THAT THERE WAS A
WHITE WOMAN CALL THAT RAISED 8 1/2 MILLION DOLLARS. I THINK ALL OF THIS IS A SIGN
OF THE ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY FOR KAMALA HARRIS.
SINCE PROBABLY 2008 WHEN BARACK OBAMA RAN.
THEY ARE SUDDENLY FIRED UP.
THEY WANT TO GET INVOLVED, RUSHING TO WHATEVER VENUE THEY CAN. SO FAR, THAT'S BEEN ZOOM CALLS.
BUT NOW THEY ARE TURNING THAT INTO RALLIES, DOORKNOCKING, AND ULTIMATELY VOTES. SMIT WE APPRECIATE IT.
I WANT TO TURN NOW TO GARRETT HAKE. LAST NIGHT, A SERIES OF
ATTACKS AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS.
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THIS WILL RESONATE? IS THIS THEIR MAIN MESSAGE?
>> IS THE MAIN MESSAGE FOR NOW. WE WILL SEE. I THINK THEY WILL TEST THIS IN REAL TIME. IT'S BEEN TRUMP'S FAVORITE ISSUE GOING BACK.
THEY FEEL LIKE IT'S KAMALA HARRIS' WEAKEST ISSUE.
SO IF YOU WANT TO HIT A CLEAN HIT JUST ON POLICY, THIS IS AS GOOD OF ONE AS ANY TO GO WITH. THEY'VE GOT $12 MILLION BEHIND
IT IN A COUPLE OF THE SWING STATES. JD VANCE IS ON THE TRAIL AS WE SPEAK. I THINK THAT WAS THE CLOSEST
STATE. HE WILL GO OFFER KAMALA HARRIS
OF EVERY -- VERY HEAVILY ON THE BORDER MESSAGE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE OPEN
BOOK, THIS IS WHERE YOU WOULD START. >> AND THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS VERY SENSITIVE TO THIS BORDER
ATTACK AREA THEY KEEP PUSHING THIS SEED. THAT SHE WAS FOCUSED
ON THE ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRATION. HOW EFFECTIVE DO YOU THINK THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN CAN BE AT
CONVINCING VOTERS TO SEE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN FOCUSING ON CENTRAL AMERICAN POLITICS.
>> IF YOU ARE EXPLAINING, YOU ARE LOSING. TRYING TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE THAT HAD TO DEAL WITH THE
BORDER CRISIS. I THINK THAT IS A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE.
YOU MAY WIN THE ARGUMENT THAT IS NOT EVEN OLD REAL -- A REAL TITLE.
THAT ARGUMENT, THEY MAY BE TECHNICALLY CORRECT ON. BUT I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MEANINGLESS TO MOST VOTERS.
>> AND JD VANCE IS HEADING THERE THIS WEEK.
CAN IT BE A MORE EFFECTIVE MESSENGER THAN TRUMP HIMSELF? >> HE CAN BE A MORE DISCIPLINED MESSENGER. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS YOU
GET BY ADDING SOMEONE LIKE HIM TO THE TICKET. HE'S BEEN PRETTY EFFECTIVE.
HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME EXPLAINING HIS OWN PAST COMMENTS, AS WELL.
One-on-one with Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA)
HE CAN KEEP SOME DEGREE IS A NATIONAL FOCUS ON THIS.
I SUPPOSE THAT'S BETTER THAN WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS HARD FEELINGS ABOUT CATS.
>> GARRETT HAAKE. GARRETT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
AND JOINING ME NOW, JUDY, SHE'S THE -- TANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. AS WE MENTIONED, REPUBLICANS
ARE TRYING TO DEFINE HER TO VOTERS BEFORE SHE CAN. TAKE A LISTEN AT SOME OF AN AD
RELEASED BY DAVE McCORMICK. SMIT PREPARED TO GET RID OF THE
FILIBUSTER. >> THERE'S NO QUESTION. SMIT WOULD YOU BAN OFFSHORE DRILLING?
>> YES. >> WE NEED TO PROBABLY THINK ABOUT STARTING FROM SCRATCH.
>> IT IS WRONG TO THINK THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MAKE COMMUNITY SAFER IS BY PUTTING MORE OFFICERS ON THE STREET.
>> DO YOU THINK SHE WILL HAVE TO STEP AWAY FROM SOME OF THE POSITIONS? OR WILL SOME OF THAT STUFF JUST BE UNPOPULAR WITH VOTERS?
>> I THINK KAMALA HARRIS' RECORD STANDS FOR ITSELF.
SHE WILL EXPLAIN WHAT SHE MEANT BY EACH OF THE STATEMENTS. BUT ONE THING I CAN SAY, SHE
HAS BEEN A LEADER ON KEY ISSUES. WHETHER IT'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, OR ADDRESSING GUN
VIOLENCE, OR ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. WHETHER IT'S MAKING
SURE WE WERE LOOSED -- REDUCED THE PRICE OF INSULIN.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK VOTERS WILL PAY ATTENTION TO. >> IS SHE THE STRONGEST CANDIDATE DEMOCRATS CAN RUN
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AT THIS MOMENT? >> SHE IS THE STRONGEST CANDIDATE BY FAR.
SHE IS OUR VICE PRESIDENT. SHE'S BEEN THERE WITH PRESIDENT
BIDEN ON KEY DECISION-MAKING TIMES. AND WITH KEY ISSUES.
SHE HAS SHOWN THAT SHE CAN GO NOT ONLY ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO TALK ABOUT SUCH ISSUES, BUT
ALSO HAS GONE ABROAD AND HAS REPRESENTED THE U.S. IN OVER 20
COUNTRIES, INCLUDING IN THE WORLDWIDE CLIMATE SUMMIT THAT
OCCURRED AT DUBAI. SO SHE HAS SHOWN SHE CAN MEET
THE TEST TO BE A GOOD LEADER, IF NOT GREAT LEADER FOR ALL OF AMERICA.
>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT A HARRIS COALITION LOOKS LIKE.
DO YOU BELIEVE SHE CAN BRING THE SAME ENTHUSIASM TO OTHER MINORITIES QUICK THE I KNOW VOTERS ARE GROWING THERE.
THE THING SHE CAN MOTIVATE SOME OF THOSE OTHER GROUPS? >> ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN ON
SEVERAL CALLS FOR HARRIS THIS PAST WEEK. PEOPLE ARE WILDLY
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS' CANDIDACY. AND I DO NOT THINK -- SHE WILL
BE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR NUMBERS THERE. LET ME TELL YOU THAT THE
POPULATION IN GEORGIA IS REALLY GROWING.
AND IN THE 2020 CAMPAIGN, ABLE TO REGISTER 30,000 NEW VOTERS, AND PRESIDENT BIDEN WON BY JUST
12,000 VOTES. THE NH PIS HAVE BEEN
MARGINALIZED TO VICTORY.
>> THE THING VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET BOLSTERS YOUR CHANCES OF TAKING BACK THE HOUSE, AND PERHAPS
HOLDING THE SENATE. SMIT ACTUALLY, PEOPLE WERE
VERY, VERY CONCERNED AS TO WHETHER IT MIGHT BE A DRAG TO
LOWER BALLAD RACES. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE KAMALA HARRIS' CANDIDACY, THAT
THE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN INCREASING, AND THAT PEOPLE ARE
SO MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT BEING ABLE TO WIN THESE SEATS TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. YOU KNOW, WE ONLY NEED A NET
FOUR SEATS TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. THE NUMBERS FOR THESE CANDIDATES IS RISING. MET WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT
STILL CONSIDERING HER VP PICK, WHO WOULD BE THE BEST CHOICE? HOW MUCH OF THIS DECISION SHOULD BE ABOUT THE ELECTORAL MAP VERSUS CHEMISTRY?
AND THEY HAVE CALLED THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR. >> I THINK THIS IS A DECISION
THAT I TRUST KAMALA HARRIS WILL MAKE TO THE BEST OF HER ABILITY.
THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS WINNING IN A BATTLEGROUND STATE THAT WILL ENSURE THAT SHE WINS THE
PRESIDENCY. CHEMISTRY IS A LARGE PART OF
IT. I THINK THE ABILITY IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE.
>> SO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE TOP PRIORITY FOR YOU.
AND YOU THINK THAT SHOULD REALLY ENTER INTO THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES? SOMEONE THAT CAN HELP DELIVER
THEM. >> ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
AND I THINK THEY ARE CERTAINLY IN THE LEAD BECAUSE OF THOSE FACTORS.
SMACKING QUICKLY, CONGRESSWOMAN, TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF ABORTION. IOWA BECAME THE LATEST STATE TO
IMPLEMENT AN ABORTION BAN.
HOW KIRCHER WITH THE ISSUE OF ABORTION BE TO DEMOCRATS' CHANCES IN NOVEMBER?
>> I BELIEVE THAT ABORTION IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE.
I BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY THAT ARE JUST SO TOTALLY DISTRAUGHT
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE DECISION. AND THE IOWA BAN ONLY MAKES IT
MUCH WORSE. ACTUALLY WITH IOWA, WE HAVE 22 STATES THAT HAVE IN ESSENCE,
BAND ABORTION. IT IS CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO
TURN THIS AROUND. RIGHT NOW, YOUNG WOMEN HAVE LESS RIGHTS THAN THEIR GRANDMOTHER DID.
WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WOMEN CAN MAKE THE CHOICES THEY NEED
ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES, THEIR FUTURES, AND NOT THE POLITICS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT'S WHAT
WILL HAPPEN IF KAMALA HARRIS IS ELECTED OUR PRESIDENT. >> CONGRESSWOMAN JUDY CHU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE APPRECIATE IT.
>> ANTI-SEMITIC, EMIGRATION, AND VIOLENT CONTENT WAS FOUND ON
THE NEWLY UNCOVERED SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT TIED TO THE CHUM
SHOOTER. ALL OF THOSE DETAILS AND MORE FROM TODAY'S CAP WILL HEAL HEARING.
-- CAPITOL HILL HEARING. SAYING IT HAS CARRIED OUT A RETALIATORY STRIKE IN -- IN
ACTION FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN THE 2024 RACE. THE FUTURE IS NOW. NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW
IDF confirms it carried out retaliatory strike against senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut
IS NBC NEWS NOW.
>>> WELCOME BACK. WE ARE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS OUT OF THE EAST.
A SENIOR HEZBOLLAH COMMANDER THAT THEY SAY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ROCKET ATTEMPT THAT
KILLED 12 CHILDREN LASSIE. OFFICIALS TELLING NBC NEWS IT
IS UNCLEAR IF THAT COMMANDER SURVIVED. THE COMMANDER TARGETED TODAY
HAS, QUOTE, AMERICAN BLOOD ON HIS HANDS. AND HE WAS ON AMERICA'S MOST
WANTED LIST AS HE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN THE BARRACKS BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 AMERICAN
SERVICE MEMBERS AND INJURED 128 OTHERS. A HOSPITAL OFFICIAL TELLS NBC
NEWS ONE WOMAN WAS KILLED IN THE STRIKE AND OTHERS WERE
INJURED, INCLUDING SIX CHILDREN. JOIN ME NOW, MATT BRADLEY.
I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS JUST LANDED IN GEORGIA.
SHE SAID, AND I'M PARAPHRASING, ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF, BUT THE ADMINISTRATION
IS STILL WORKING ON THE DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION.
NO DETAILS ARE STILL UNFOLDING. BUT WHAT ARE YOU EARING FROM WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?
AND WHAT ARE WE HEARING FROM THAT COMMANDER WHO WAS TARGETED IN THE STRIKE?
>> YEAH. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE IS ALIVE OR DEAD. HE IS QUOTED DIFFERENT SOURCES.
HE IS A SENIOR HEZBOLLAH COMMANDER. THERE WAS TALKS EARLIER COUPLE DAYS AGO THAT THEY MIGHT BE
TARGETING SOMEONE ELSE WOULD THEY CONSIDER SOMEONE TO BE BEHIND THE ATTACK ON THAT SOCCER FIELD THAT KILLED A DOZEN CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS ON
SATURDAY. BUT THIS MAN AS YOU MENTIONED, HE HAD A BOUNTY ON HIS HEAD
FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
THIS IS A MAN WHO WAS CERTAINLY IN ISRAEL'S CROSSHAIRS WHITE A WHILE. THE QUESTION FOR EVERYBODY HERE,
REALLY FOR THE WIDER REGION, IS ISRAEL GOING TO BE SATISFIED?
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WILL END THEIR DESIRE? WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT OF
THIS LANGUAGE OVER THE PAST COUPLE DAYS. AND IF SO, WHAT WILL HEZBOLLAH'S RESPONSE BE?
THEY WILL UPGRADE THE SITUATION,
>> THE WHITE HOUSE, AS YOU ALL KNOW, URGING NETANYAHU TO TAKE A MORE TARGETED RESPONSE.
DOES IT APPEAR THAT ISRAEL DID TAKE THAT MORE RESTRAINED APPROACH?
>> Reporter: IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU CONSIDER. THIS WILL BE OPEN FOR
INTERPRETATION. EVERYONE HERE IN LEBANON TALKS ABOUT ISRAEL AND HEZBOLLAH.
THEIR MINDS ALWAYS GO BACK TO 2006. IT LAID WASTE TO THE ENTIRE
SOUTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH IS WHERE WE FOUND TODAY'S AIRSTRIKE THAT KILLED AT LEAST
ONE PERSON. COMPARED TO THAT SITUATION AND THE RHETORIC WE'VE BEEN HEARING, THIS CONCEPT CALLED
THE DOCTRINE, NAMED AFTER THAT VERY HEZBOLLAH NEIGHBORHOOD.
ONE OF THE PROMINENT COMMANDERS, A PROMINENT POLITICIAN.
HE SAID THE IDEA WAS THAT IF THERE ARE ANY ATTACKS FROM HEZBOLLAH, THAT ISRAEL WOULD PUNISH ALL OF LEBANON.
WELL, IF THAT WAS THEIR PLAN, IF THAT WAS THEIR ESCALATION, THEY HAVEN'T DONE THAT TONIGHT.
BUT IF HEZBOLLAH DECIDES TO RESPOND, A LOT OF THE WORST
EXPECTATIONS OF FOLKS HERE HAD. THAT REALLY COULD COME INTO PLAY ANY TIME. >> MAD RALLY DASH BRADLEY COME
ALIVE FOR US. PLEASE STAY SAFE. NEXT, ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND MEETS THE PRESS.
Acting Secret Service director testifies before Senate
>>> WELCOME BACK. IT'S BEEN ANOTHER EMOTIONAL DAY OF TESTIMONY ON CAPITOL HILL. LAWMAKERS ONCE AGAIN GRILLING TOP OFFICIALS ABOUT THE EVENTS
LEADING UP TO THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP.
TODAY, ALONGSIDE DEPUTY FBI DIRECTOR AND FIRM OF THE
SENATE, JUDICIARY, AND HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEES. HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE MISTAKES, INCLUDING ITS FAILURE TO SPOT
THE GUNMEN ON A ROOF AND IN ITS FAILURE TO CONFRONT THE SHOOTER.
YOU WILL HERE REFER TO AS AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM. HOURS BEFORE THE SHOOTING --
>> I WENT TO THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING WHERE THE ASSAILANT FIRED SHOTS.
I LANED -- LAID IN POSITION.
WHAT I SAW MADE ME ASHAMED. AS A CAREER LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICER AND A 25 YEAR VETERAN WITH THE SECRET SERVICE, I CANNOT DEFEND WHY THAT ROOF WAS
NOT BETTER SICK WEIRD. IF WE WOULD HAVE GEO-LOCATED HIM
BECAUSE THAT PLATFORM HAVE BEEN UP. IT IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE STRUGGLED WITH TO UNDERSTAND.
IT IS SOMETHING THAT I FEEL AS THOUGH WE COULD HAVE PERHAPS FOUND HIM.
WE COULD HAVE MAYBE STOPPED HIM. >> ALSO CONCEDING THAT ISSUES
WITH RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PREVENTED AGENT FROM RESPONDING MORE QUICKLY FROM REPORTS OF A
MAN WITH A GUN ON THE ROOF.
>> THIS COMES A WEEK AFTER HIS PREDECESSOR RESIGNED. AND WHILE
ROW WAS MORE FORTHCOMING IN PRESENT DAY, THERE WAS STILL PLENTY OF HEATED EXCHANGES LIKE THIS ONE OVER ACCOUNTABILITY AT
THE AGENCY. ALL RIGHT. WE DON'T HAVE THAT SOUND FROM
JOSH, SO WILL BRING IN NBC NEWS HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT. YOU ARE WATCHING THIS RATHER LENGTHY HEARING THROUGHOUT THE
DAY. HOW DID THE SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR DO IN COMPARISON?
>> I WOULD DO MY BEST IMPRESSION. BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A RECAP, I DO THINK WE SAW TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.
WHEN THE DIRECTOR BASICALLY JUST PUNTED ON EVERY QUESTION SHE WAS ASKED.
SOME OF THE MOST BASIC ONE SHE COULDN'T ANSWER. WHAT THEY KNEW ABOUT HIM AT THE TIME TRUMP TOOK THE STAGE.
EVEN AFTER MULTIPLE REPORTS THAT THE SECRET SERVICE WERE TIPPED OFF BY LOCAL ENFORCEMENT
THAT THERE WAS A SUSPICIOUS PERSON IN THE CROWD.
TODAY WITH THE NEW ACTING DIRECTOR, HE WAS ABLE TO ANSWER QUITE A BIT MORE. AND SOME OF THE HEADLINES THAT CAME OUT OF THIS, THEY ARE
DOING A DISCIPLINARY REVIEW. RATHER THAN JUST GETTING A REPORT SIX MONTHS FROM NOW,
THERE WILL BE PEOPLE FIRED, OR DISCIPLINED, OR STILL WORKING AT THE SECRET SERVICE.
WE MAY HAVE NAMES ABOUT WHO MADE THE DECISIONS THAT DAY,
SHOULD THERE HAVE BEEN MORE RESOURCES. SHOULD THEY HAVE
EXPANDED THEIR SECURITY PERIMETER. AND ANOTHER THING THAT HE DID PUSH BACK ON WAS THIS IDEA THAT
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO PROPERLY SECURE TRUMP. THERE WAS A HEATED EXCHANGE THERE WITH TED CRUZ.
>> YEAH. AND SEVERAL SENATORS. THEY WERE ARGUING THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAD REQUESTED
MORE AGENTS, MORE RESOURCES. WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT?
IS THAT TRUE, OR NOT? >> IT IS TRUE.
WE'VE REPORTED HERE. WASHINGTON POST WAS THE FIRST TO REPORT THAT. THEY SAID THAT THERE WERE PREVIOUS RALLIES.
THEY DID NOT SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR THAT FOR THE JULY 13th RALLY. BUT WHAT HE SAID, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE RESOURCES. THEY'VE INCREASED THIS JUST IN
THE LAST YEAR. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY ARE DESPERATE FOR. BUT HE WAS TOLD TO DREAM BIG.
HE'S SO DIFFERENT FROM SECURING OTHER CANDIDATES. >> AND AS WE MENTIONED, THERE
IS AN F VI OFFICIAL AT THE HEARING TODAY, AS WELL.
>> I THOUGHT THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST REVELATION.
THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COMB THROUGH MANY OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS. LOOKING AT 86 DIFFERENT PLATFORMS TO SEE WHERE HE MIGHT
HAVE ACCOUNTS. THEY ARE STILL VERIFYING A LOT OF THIS. HE WAS QUICK TO PUT A
DISCLAIMER. IT DOES SEEM TO INDICATE THAT PROFILES LOOK LIKE THEY CAME
FROM THE SHOOTER. COULD THAT HAVE SOMEHOW
INFLUENCES MIND-SET? AND STILL WHILE HE WOULD CHOOSE
TRUMP AS A TARGET? ARE THAT RALLY IS A TARGET? I DO HAVE TO COUPLE THAT WITH PREVIOUS RECORDINGS.
HE HAD ALSO BEEN LOOKING AT THE SCHEDULE OF BIDEN, AND WHEN THE DNC WOULD BE, AS WELL.
>> OVERALL, DO YOU THINK ROW DID A BETTER JOB?
>> ANYONE WHO WATCHED BOTH THOSE HEARINGS WOULD SAY THAT. I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS
BECAUSE HE IS A BETTER, MORE FORTHCOMING PUBLIC SERVANT THAN CHEATLE WAS.
CERTAINLY A JOURNALIST, WE ARE HOPING THAT THEY SHOULD LEARN A LESSON THEY SHOULD BE MORE TRANSPARENT BECAUSE THE
QUESTIONS WON'T START -- STOP. I'M TOLD TO STAY TUNED ON THAT.
>> JULIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. MOMENTS AGO, ATTORNEY GENERAL
MERRICK GARLAND SAT DOWN FOR AN INCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH KEN DILANIAN, HIS FIRST SINCE THE
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT. >> HOW ALARMED ARE YOU THAT A 20-YEAR-OLD WAS ABLE TO GET A
CLEAR SHOT 150 YARDS FROM OUR PRESIDENT? >> THIS IS EXTREMELY ALARMING.
DEMOCRACY WILL NOT SURVIVE IF PEOPLE DECIDE THE WAY THEY WILL GET THE OUTCOMES THEY WANT, OR
WHATEVER OTHER MOTIVE HE MIGHT HAVE IS BY KILLING SOMEONE.
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE, WHY IT HAPPENED, AND TO MAKE SURE IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
>> WE WILL HAVE MORE TO SITDOWN INTERVIEW TONIGHT ON NBC NIGHTLY NEWS WITH LESTER HOLT.
>>> UP NEXT, IF IT'S TUESDAY, IT'S PRIMARY DAY IN BATTLEGROUND ARIZONA. NEW REPORTING ON THE KEY SENATE
AND HOUSE RACES TO WATCHNEWS THS
ORGANIZATION. >>> THE FIRE HAS GROWN LEAPS AND BOUNDS. >> HOW ARE YOU DOING? >> PRETTY, PRETTY BAD.
Maricopa Co. officials focus on election transparency
>>> WELCOME BACK. AS WE LIKE TO SAY AROUND HERE, IF IT'S TUESDAY, SOMEONE IS VOTING SOMEWHERE.
IN THE SENATE PRIMARY, RUNNING UNOPPOSED FOR THE SEAT BEING
VACATED BY INDEPENDENT KIERSTEN CINEMA.
KARI LAKE, WHO LOST IN HER BID MONTHS AGO, BACK IN THE SENATE
PRIMARY. BOTH BLAKE MASTERS AND --
HOLIDAY HAVE NOW BOTH BEEN ENDORSED BY TRUMP AS THEY FIGHT IT OUT TO BE THE NOMINEE IN
ARIZONA'S EIGHTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. HOLIDAY IS AN ELECTION DENIER.
HIS CAMPAIGN ON THE BASELESS CLAIM THAT 2020 ELECTION WAS STOLEN.
OFFICIALS IN MARICOPA COUNTY ARE WORKING TO COMBAT THOSE KINDS OF PLANTS.
ALEX HAS MORE ON THOSE EFFORTS.
>> SUPERVISOR BILL GATES SAY HE IS READY.
>> FOR BOTH THE PRIMARY ELECTION AND GENERAL ELECTION.
>> Reporter: MAKING ABOUT THIS ELECTION CYCLE. >> WE'VE COMMITTED TO RUNNING THE MOST TRANSPARENT ELECTION WE'VE EVER RUN.
>> Reporter: NEW STEPS TO THE -- CONSPIRACY. WHILE BALLOTS
WERE STILL BEING COUNTED -- >> THERE IS A PROCESS THAT IS GOING WITH PEOPLE ANGRY, SAYING
THEY THINK THE SELECTION IS BEING STOLEN FROM THE PRESIDENT, EVEN THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF THAT.
>> Reporter: UNFOUNDED CLAIMS THAT HE WAS CHEATED. >> Reporter: COWORKERS HAD TO
BE ESCORTED TO THEIR CARS. >> IN 2022, MORE UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS.
>> BACK THERE, THEY DON'T WANT US TALKING ABOUT STOLEN
ELECTIONS. >> THE FALSEHOOD SHE IS CONTINUING TO SPREAD TWO YEARS LATER IN HER SENATE BID.
>> YOU KNOW THE GARBAGE THEY ARE PUSHING. >> TO ME, IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE.
PEOPLE WHO ARE CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE, NOMINEES OF THE MAJOR
PARTIES SPREADING THAT KIND OF INFORMATION.
>> Reporter: IN THIS CYCLE, INSTALLING ADDITIONAL SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS INSIDE THE ELECTION SENATOR, -- CENTER.
ALSO SPENDING $15 MILLION IN NEW EQUIPMENT THAT COULD HELP CRANK OUT RESULTS MORE QUICKLY.
AND THROUGH THE DOORS OF THEIR FACILITY IN HOPES OF RESTORING FAITH IN MARICOPA ELECTIONS. >> WE BOUGHT IN MORE TOURS THAN
EVER BEFORE. >> THE LAST FOUR YEARS HAVE BEEN TOUGH FOR HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES.
>> DEATH THREATS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. >> A REPUBLICAN LIKE GATES, FACING THE THREAT FROM ANOTHER
REPUBLICAN LEADER IN MARCH. >> IF HE WALKED IN THIS ROOM, I
WOULD LYNCH HIM. >> PEOPLE IN THE PARTY WHO CLAIM WE ARE TRAITORS, THAT WE
ARE TRYING TO RIG ELECTIONS.
>> Reporter: THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA WILL UNDERSTAND.
>> THESE AREN'T JUST MACHINES WHO ARE DOING THIS WORK. THESE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HERE.
OUR AUNTS, UNCLES, MOTHERS, FATHERS, GRANDMOTHERS, OR GRANDFATHERS. WE OWE IT TO THEM TO MAKE SURE
PEOPLE KNOW THE FACTS, AND THE GOOD WORK THEY ARE DOING. >> ALEX JOINS ME NOW FROM
PHOENIX. SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU.
EVEN WITH ALL THE EMPHASIS ON TRANSPARENCY, THE ELECTION RESULTS WILL STILL BE CHALLENGED, AREN'T THEY? >> GABE, IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW
THAT IN 2020 AFTER THE GENERAL ELECTION, AND 2022 AFTER THE
MIDTERM ELECTION HERE, MARICOPA COUNTY AND THE STATE FACES
DOZENS OF CHALLENGES. FOR EVERY ONE OF THOSE THAT FOCUS ON THE MERITS, THOSE
FAILED. IF HISTORY IS ANY INDICATOR, WE
COULD FACE CHARGES IN 2024 -- CHANGES IN 2024.
>> WHAT DID HE SAY?
>> THAT'S RIGHT. HE VOTED AT THIS POLLING LOCATION JUST ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
FROM BEING A PRIMARY CANDIDATE TO A GENERAL ELECTION CANDIDATE, HE IS EXUDING CONFIDENCE.
I WANTED TO TELL YOU WHAT HE TOLD ME THIS MORNING. >> IS FEELS GREAT. WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 18
MONTHS. I'M VERY CONFIDENT, BECAUSE WE TRAVELED THE STATE.
WE'VE BEEN GOING TO THE REDDEST AREAS, THE BLUEST AREAS. WE ARE OUT WORKING EVERYONE.
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, WE WILL HAVE THE WINNING TEAM TO WIN.
>> Reporter: HE TALKED ABOUT TRAVELING ALL OVER THE STATE.
VISITING ALL OF THE 22 NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES HERE IN ARIZONA.
SO FAR, ABOUT 19 OF THOSE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES
HOPING TO HIT ALL 22 OF THOSE. >> ALEX, LIFE FOR US IN PHOENIX.
AND I WANT TO TURN NOW TO SOME LIVE PICTURES. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS RIGHT THERE IN ATLANTA MAKING A
STOP IN A POPULAR RESTAURANT. YOU SEE HER THERE, GREETING SUPPORTERS.
OF COURSE AS WE REPORTED EARLIER IN THE BROADCAST, A KEY STOP FOR KAMALA HARRIS. JUST
HER SECOND MAJOR RALLY TONIGHT SINCE BECOMING THE DE FACTO NOMINEE. SHE IS TRYING TO COURT
YOUNG, BLACK VOTERS. SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING A BIT WHEN COMPARED TO 2020.
A KEY PART OF HER COALITION. AGAIN, THOSE ARE LIVE PICTURES
OF VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS. HER RALLY IS SCHEDULED FOR JUST A FEW HOURS FROM NOW.
>>> STILL TO COME, DONALD TRUMP STANDBY VANCE. HOW THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS STICKING UP FOR
HIS RUNNING MATE AS THE VP NOMINEE FACES BACKLASH FOR PAST COMM PALESTINIAN AND ISRAELI HA
Panel: Trump defends Vance comments on childless Democrats
FOUND COMMON GROUND. >> TOP STORY WITH TOM LLAMAS, STREAMING WEEKNIGHTS AT 7:00 ON
NBC NEWS NOW. >>> WELCOME BACK.
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP NOW DEFENDING HIS OWN RUNNING MATE. QUOTE, CHILDLESS -- CHILDISH
DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO PLAY THE GAME.
>> FIRST OF ALL, HE IS GOT TREMENDOUS SUPPORT. PEOPLE THAT LIKE FAMILIES.
HE MADE A STATEMENT HAVING TO DO WITH FAMILIES. HE'S NOT AGAINST ANYTHING.
HE LOVES FAMILY. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM. HE GREW UP IN A VERY
INTERESTING FAMILY SITUATION. AND HE FEELS FAMILY IS GOOD. I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND IT.
NO, I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND IT. >> VANCE TOLD DONORS THIS
WEEKEND PRESIDENT BIDEN DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE IS A, QUOTE, POLITICAL SUCKER PUNCH.
JOINING ME NOW IS THE PANEL. CO-AUTHOR OF THE EARLY 202 AT THE WASHINGTON POST.
AND HOUSE OF WHAT A DAY PODCASTS. AND RICK TYLER, REPUBLICAN --
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, THE VICE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION SHOULD DO NO HARM. WHAT IS IT DOING RIGHT NOW?
>> A LITTLE BIT OF HARM. NOT REALLY MEETING THOSE GOALS. LOOK, DONALD TRUMP PICKED JD VANCE IN A DIFFERENT RACE.
HE WAS VERY CONFIDENT HE WAS GOING TO END. HE DIDN'T THINK HE WANTED
SOMEONE WHO WAS GOING TO CONTINUE THE TRUMP BRAND OF THE PARTY. NOW WITH A BRAND-NEW CANDIDATE AT THE TOP OF THE DEMOCRATIC
TICKET, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC.
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT JD VANCE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE. THERE IS A REASON PEOPLE TEND
TO LIKE PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF EXPERIENCE. >> TRUMP JD VANCE FOR DIFFERENT
RACE, TO RUN A DIFFERENT RACE. WHO SHOULD HE PICK FOR THIS RACE? OR WHICH VP CANDIDATE WOULD
HAVE DONE BETTER AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS? >> I KNOW HE LOVED TO TALK
ABOUT THE DP RACE. BUT IN THE END, VP RACES MATTER
LITTLE. WILL POLITICAL OPERATION FROM WHAT STATE WILL BRING MORE TO
THE TICKET? NOW IN SOME CASES, PERHAPS THE
PERCEIVED WEAKNESS, LET'S PICK JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE HAD A STRONG FOREIGN POLICY WEEK IS
-- WEAKNESS. IF YOU WILL PICK THE ABSOLUTELY WRONG CANDIDATE IN THE WRONG
YEAR, BECAUSE THE TARGET AUDIENCE ARE WOMEN AND YOUNG
WOMEN. IN THE WAKE OF ROE V. WADE, YOU
WOULD NOT PICK SOMEBODY. AND THEY EITHER KNEW THIS WAS IN HIS PAST, THEY DIDN'T
PREPARE FOR, OR WORSE, THEY DIDN'T KNOW. >> I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT
THAT THEY VOTE FOR THE TOP OF THE TICKET. SO WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW?
TRUMP IS NOW HAVING TO DEFEND HIS TICKET. IT'S TAKING UP HIS OXYGEN,
WHICH DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT LIKE. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS WITH ANYONE?
AND HE'S NOT DOING IT NOW. >> TIME, MONEY, PEOPLE, AND IDEAS.
DEFENDING HIS PICK FOR VP WHEN HE SHOULD BE ON OFFENSE, DEFINING HARRIS. THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
THE MORE TIME HE SPENDS ON THIS, TIME IS SLIPPING AWAY. >> IT'S ALL -- HIS SON WAS
PUSHING HIM. TECH DONORS.
AND THE EXPECTED WITH DONALD TRUMP, THAT HAS BEEN EXPECTED
SINCE 2015. >> TWO SOURCES TOLD ME EARLIER
THAT KAMALA HARRIS IS GOING TO BE HEADING OUT WITH HER OWN YET
TO BE NAMED VP. NOW SHE WAS ASKED AS SHE WAS LEAVING FOR ATLANTA TODAY HAS
SHE MADE HER SELECTION. SHE VERY COYLY SAID NOT YET.
RICK WAS TALKING ABOUT THE KEY THING IS VOTES. YOU KNOW, BRINGING BATTLEGROUND
STATES. WHAT SHOULD DEMOCRATS REALLY BE LOOKING FOR HERE. SHOULD BE JOSH HAPIRO BECAUSE OF PENNSYLVANIA, OR SOMEONE
ELSE? >> I FEEL LIKE PROTECTING THE BLUE WALL IS ABSOLUTELY A
PRIORITY. ALSO MESSAGING AND EXPANDING BROUGHT A DEAL.
MAKING SOMEONE LIKE TIM WALZ LOOKED REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW. DON'T FALL FOR? WHAT?
>> WE'VE AGREED ON THE BLUE WALL PROTECTION. PENNSYLVANIA'S THREE POINTS
PERIODS WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, AND OHIO. HE APPEALS ACROSS THE MIDWEST. SO I WON'T BOX HIM IN LIKE THAT.
>> WE TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER IN THE SHOW. WHITE DUDES FOR HARRIS . HE'S DOING PRETTY WELL AND THAT RESPECT.
TALKING ABOUT JD VANCE, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WITH SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. THAT
IT WAS, QUOTE, A POLITICAL SUCKER PUNCH. PART OF IT IS TO TELL THE TRUTH.
>> THIS IS WHY EXPERIENCE MATTERS. >> EXPERIENCE. YOU SHOULD KNOW NOT TO TELL THE
TRUTH. IS THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN REALLY WORRIED HERE?
>> THINGS FROM DONOR MEETINGS GET LEAKED ALL THE TIME. EITHER JD VANCE WAS VERY STRATEGIC AND SAID THAT, ONCE IN GET TO GET LEAKED, OR MORE
THAN LIKELY, HE DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS GOING TO GET LEAKED. WHATEVER IT IS, THE EFFECT IS
THAT JD VANCE DID TELL THE TRUTH. AND IT'S IN DIRECT CONTRAST TO
HOW DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO SPIN IT. I THINK THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS
STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT.
THEY'VE BEEN THROWN FOR LODZ -- A HUGE LOOP.
RICK, THE CAMPAIGNS ARE BOTH
OUT WITH ADS TODAY. THE VICE PRESIDENT IS STILL TRYING TO INTRODUCE HERSELF TO THE COUNTRY. AND TRUMP IS TRYING TO HIT HER
RECORDS AS A PROSECUTOR, HIGHLIGHTED RECORD ON THE BORDER. DO YOU THINK THEM FOCUSING ON
THE BORDER, DO YOU THINK IT WILL REALLY CUT THROUGH WHILE HARRIS FOCUSES ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS?
>> LOOK, YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR
CAMPAIGN IS ALWAYS YOUR BIGGEST WEAKNESS. THE FACT THAT SHE IS A PROSECUTOR IS ONE OF HER BIGGEST STRENGTHS. TRUMP IS SMART.
HE WILL ATTACK THAT.
WHEN HE, 34 TIMES CONVICTED FELON, FACES A PROSECUTOR.
SHE HAS THIS UNIQUE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM TO MAKE HIM LOOK WEAK
FOR ACTING LIKE THE VICTIM ALL THE TIME WHEN IN FACT, SHE'S THE PROSECUTOR.
I'M NOT A STRATEGIST FOR THE DEMOCRATS. BUT I WOULD DRIVE A WEDGE
THEY'RE VERY, VERY HARD >> GOVERNOR ROY COOPER TOOK
HIMSELF OUT OF THE RACE. WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? DO YOU THINK HE WILL DO BETTER IN THE SENATE?
>> A FULL HE HOPES HE HAS HIS EYE ON THE SENATE. THAT HE WILL RUN AN ATTEMPT TO
WIN IN A STATE WHERE THEY HAVEN'T HAD STATEWIDE SUCCESS.
KNOWING THAT THIS RACE IS NOT ONLY ABOUT DELIVERING VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS -- A VICTORY,
BUT DELIVERING HER A CONGRESS THAT CAN GET THINGS DONE. >> WE WERE JUST TALKING THIS IN
THE BREAK. IS IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT 17
DAYS AGO, THIS ASSASSINATION ON WITH THE CONTEXT THIS RACE HAS GONE ON ITS HEAD IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS.
WHAT HAVE YOU MADE OF IT? >> WHAT WAS MONTHS -- WANTS THE
MOST BORING. AND THEN ALL OF
THIS WAS COMPLETELY TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. IT'S EXHAUSTING, EXHILARATING, FUN. IT'S GOTTEN A LOT MORE PEOPLE
ENGAGED. >> I DON'T SEE IT WEARING OFF,
THIS IS THE REASON WHY. THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN INVESTING
IN THE PEOPLE, VOLUNTEERS, THOUSANDS, THEY ARE LARGELY UNDER 35 YEARS OLD.
IT IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE- BUILDING MOMENT, I DON'T SEE IT GOING ANY WAY AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE CHECKED IN.
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.
WE APPRECIATE IT. I'M GABE GUTIE
