>> LET'S LOOK AT AN OLYMPIC
SPORT THAT WE'VE ALL HEARD OF
WE MIGHT HAVE EVEN SEEN. BUT DO YOU REALLY KNOW THE
BASICS? WHAT ARE THE RULES? HOW DO YOU KEEP SCORE? HOW DO
YOU WIN? LET'S LOOK TODAY CLOSER AT OLYMPIC HANDBALL.
NOW IN THE UNITED STATES, CAMPBELL IS STILL VERY MUCH A
NICHE SPORT, BUT IT'S GOT ELEMENTS OF SOME AMERICAN
FAVORITES LIKE SOCCER AND BASKETBALL AND HOCKEY. SO HOW
IS HANDBALL PLAYED AND HOW EXACTLY IS IT SCORED? SO YOU'VE
GOT 6 PLAYERS WHO ARE ON THE COURT FOR EACH TEAM. PLUS ONE
GOALTENDER 7 ON 7 HUGE ACTIVISTS. SIMPLE THROW THE
BALL INTO THE OPPONENT'S GOAL TO SCORE POINTS. ONE GOAL.
ONE POINT
NOW A HANDBALL LOOKS A LOT LIKE A SOCCER BALL BUT IT IS A
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN ONE. WHEN YOU GET THE BALL, YOU CAN
DO A COUPLE OF THINGS. YOU CAN DRIBBLE. YOU SEE THAT RIGHT
HERE OR YOU CAN SHOOT IT. YOU SEE THAT RIGHT THERE OR YOU
CAN PASS THE BALL TO ONE OF YOUR TEAMMATES. UNLIKE
BASKETBALL PLAYERS CAN TAKE 3 STEPS IN BETWEEN DRIBBLES ONCE
A PLAYER DRIBBLES. THE COUNTDOWN TIMER IN THE STEP
COUNTER RECESS
AND HAND BALL IS PLAYED ON A COURT. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
SIZE HERE. IT'S ABOUT 130 FEET BY 65 FEET. WE GIVE YOU
SOMETHING TO COMPARE IT TO THAT IS BIGGER, SIGNIFICANTLY
BIGGER. THEN A BASKETBALL COURT. MAYBE YOU COULD THINK OF
TO FULL TENNIS COURTS SIDE BY SIDE. NOW YOU SEE HERE A
DIAGRAM OF THE HANDBALL COURT, A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT LINES.
EACH ONE IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. SO LET'S GO THROUGH THEM HERE.
WE'LL START WITH THE AREA IN ORANGE YOU SEE RIGHT HERE.
THIS IS COLD GOAL AREA IS RESERVED JUST FOR EACH TEAM'S
GOAL KEEPER. BUT THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION, THOUGH, BECAUSE
REMEMBER, WHEN YOU'RE ON OFFENSE, YOU COULD TAKE THOSE 3
STEPS WITH THE BALL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'LL SEE PLAYERS
DO IS THEY'LL GET A RUNNING START AND THEY'LL TAKE A JUMP
SHOT AS LONG AS YOUR FEET ARE PLANTED BEHIND THIS LINE.
WHEN YOU TAKE OFF THE JUMP SHOT, YOU CAN LAND IN THE GOAL
AREA AS LONG AS YOU RELEASE THE BALL BEFORE YOUR FEET LAND IN
THAT GOAL AREA. SEE THAT A LOT WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING HIM BALL
MOVING ON HERE. YOU SEE THIS. THIS IS CALLED THE 7 METER LINE
AND THIS COMES INTO PLAY. IF THE DEFENSE COMMITS THE FOUL
THAT PREVENTS THE OFFENSE POTENTIALLY FROM SCORING IN THE
OFFENSE WILL THEN CHOOSE ONE PLAYER WHO GETS A PENALTY THROW
FROM THE 7 METER LINE. THIS IS SORT OF LIKE IN SOCCER. YOU SEE
A PENALTY KICK WILL HIGHLIGHT THE OTHER LINE HERE. THIS IS
CALLED THE 4 METER LINE AND BASICALLY THE GOAL KEEPER WHEN
THERE'S A PENALTY THROW CAN COME OUT TO THE 4 METER LINE.
BUT NO FURTHER MOVING ON EVEN FURTHER HERE YOU SEE THIS
DASHED LINE HERE. SORT OF A SECOND. ARE THEY CALL THIS ONE
THAN I NEED YOUR LIGHT NOW? THIS IS GOING TO COME INTO PLAY
IF A FOUL IS COMMITTED BETWEEN THE 6 IN THE 9 METER LINES IN
THIS ZONE RIGHT HERE, IF THEY FOLLOWED BY THE DEFENSE IS
COMMITTED THERE AND THE OFFENSE GETS POSSESSION ALONG THIS LINE
ROUGHLY WHERE EVER THE INFRACTION OCCURRED AND WE SAY
THIS IS A FAST PACED GAME. IT ALSO CAN BE A HIGH-SCORING
GAME. TEAMS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO JUST SIT THERE AND HOLD THE
BALL AND PASSED AROUND. THEY HAVE TO SHOOT QUICKLY IF NO
SHOT ON GOAL IS TAKEN AFTER 4 PASSES, TEAM LOSES POSSESSION
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT. WELL, I KNOW I FOR ONE. I'M EXCITED TO
WATCH THEM HANDBALL THIS SUMMER FROM PARIS AND STAY TUNED FOR
MORE AS WE LOOK AT THE RULES AS WE LOOK AT THE SCORING AS WE
LOOK AT HOW TO WIN AN OLYMPIC SPORTS
