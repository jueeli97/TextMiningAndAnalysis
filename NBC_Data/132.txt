AFTER RALLIES IN SEVERAL
BATTLEGROUND STATES.
HETS BRING IN SOME OF MY
COLLEAGUES
DASHA BURNS IS IN PENNSYLVANIA
AHEAD OF TRUMP'S RALLY AND STEVE
CORNEGY IS AT THE BIG BOARD WITH
MORE ON THE BATTLEGROUND
IMPLICATIONS OF THE BATTLEGROUND
AND CHUCK TODD IS HERE WITH ME
ON SET
CHUCK TODD, I WANT YOUR REACTION
TO THE CONFERENCE.
DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP WA
TRYING TO GO IN THERE TO GET A
RISE AND APPEAL TO HIS BASE?
>> THAT IS ALWAYS HIS DEFAULT.
THIS IS HIS DEFAULT MODE
YOU HAVE DEFAULT SETTINGS ON
ELECTRONICS AND THIS IS HI
DEFAULT SETTING.
I THINK HIS INTINCT WAS I'
GOING TO GET INTO IT HERE.
I'M GOING TO SEE IF I CAN CREATE
SOME TENSION IN THE ROOM
I THINK HE THOUGHT -- I DON'
KNOW WHERE HE GOT THIS IDEA.
I THINK HE THOUGHT SOMEHOW H
COULD PLAY HER MIXED IDENTITY,
THAT HE COULD DO THIS.
AND I HEARD FROM A BUNCH O
PEOPLE AS THIS WAS GOING ON AN
REPUBLICANS AND SAYING WHY I
TRUMP HELPING DEMOCRATS.
AND.
>> THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN HAS TO BE
LOVING THIS.
>> RIGHT
>> HAVING TO CATCH MYSELF.
YES, THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN, THEY
WERE POSTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
>> MY INITIAL REACTION WAS THA
THE TWO PEOPLE RUNNING THE
CAMPAIGN, IT HAS BROUGHT AS MUCH
DISCIPLINE AS POSSIBLE AROUN
DONALD TRUMP
THERE IS ALMOST SHOW MUCH YO
CAN DO AS LONG AS YOU CAN KEEP
HIM AWAY FROM UNSCRIPTED
MOMENTS.
I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD OF A ON
ON ONE DEBATE BETWEEN TRUMP AN
HARRIS IS JUST DRAMATICALLY, I
YOU COULD WATCH THE STOC
MARKET, YOU WOULD SELL
THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM, THERE IS
NO GOOD THAT WILL COME OUT OF
ONE ON ONE DEBATE WITH DONAL
TRUMP.
HE HAS NEVER HANDLED BEING
QUESTIONED BY AFRICAN AMERICAN
WOMEN WELL
IT HAS ALWAYS GONE OFF THE RAILS
LIKE IT DID TODAY.
>> AND CHUCK, REALLY QUICKLY
CAN YOU ESTIMATE HOW MANY TIME
IN THE LAST 8, 9 YEARS, THIS
DONALD TRUMP CAME INTO THE
POLITICAL ARENA THAT WE KEEP
SAYING, OH, THIS IS TOO FAR.
HE'S GONE TOO FAR.
THE RACIAL IDENTITY QUESTION
TODAY OF ANY OTHER POLITICIAN,
THIS SEEMED LIKE ONE OF THOS
MOMENTS.
>> I TAKE YOUR POINT ON THAT BUT
WHAT HE HAD IS IT'S A REMINDER
THAT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIS OW
WORST ENEMY.
HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN -- HE TOG
TALKS HIMSELF INTO PROBLEMS.
IF HE JUST NO SHOWS TODAY, THA
DOESN'T HAPPEN
IF HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO ADMI
A MISTAKE, IF HE DID, HE WOULD
HAVE HAD A SECOND TERM
WE CAN SAY IF ONLY HE WOULD DO
THIS, IT DOZEN MATTER.
IT'S NOT WHO HE IS
THIS IS WHO HE IS.
TRUMP IS GOING TO TRUMP.
THAT'S WHAT WE SAW TODAY
AND THIS WAS VINTAGE TRUMP
HE CAN'T HELP HIMSELF.
THIS IS WHY I HAVE SOM
SKEPTICISM WHETHER THE COUNTRY
IS READY TO ELECT KAMALA HARRIS.
BUT THE IDEA THAT THIS WOULD
MAKE HIM DISASSEMBLE IS ALWAYS
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A POTENTIAL
HERE
THAT HE COULD LOSE THE RACE AN
IT APPEARS HE IS LOSING.
>> I WANT TO BRING IN DASH
BURNS IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE IN A
COUPLE OF HOURS, THERE WILL BE A
RALLY FOR DONALD TRUMP
YOU CAN SEE THE CROWD.
HOW IS THE CAMPAIGN FEELIN
ABOUT THE COMMENTS HE MADE ABOUT
HARRIS' HERITAGE THIS AFTERNOON?
>> THEY ARE ALREADY ON DEFENSE
THERE ARE TWEETS FROM ALLIES AND
ALSO TWEETING THIS GOES TO SHO
THAT FAKE NEWS JOURNALISTS DON'T
CARE ABOUT INFLATION OR BORDER
SECURITY OR IMPROVING OU
SCHOOLS, ET CETERA, THEY JUS
CARE ABOUT GETTING TRUMP
SO THEY ARE ON DEFENSE
WE ARE OUT WITH A COMMENT FROM
THE CAMPAIGN OFFICIALLY.
WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE
FORMER PRESIDENT SAYS ON TRUTH
SOCIAL
THEY ARE LEANING INTO THIS AS
COMBATIC ENVIRONMENT HE WENT
INTO
THIS IS HOW THE FORMER PRESIDENT
CHOSE TO HANDLE IT
>> SO THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S
CAMPAIGN,HOW DID IT FEEL ABOUT
KAMALA HARRIS GETTING ALL OF THE
MEDIA ATTENTION FOR THE PAST
COUPLE OF DAYS
THE ECOSYSTEM HAS BEEN DOMINATED
BY HEADLINES ABOUT HER
IS THIS A POSITION THAT TH
TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS USED TO?
>> YOU AND I KNOW THAT THE
FORMER PRESIDENT DOESN'T LIKE IT
WHEN HE IS NOT THE CENTER OF
ATTENTION.
SO MAYBE IT WAS A CHANCE TO GE
THE HEADLINES FOCUSED ON HIM
FOR BETTER OR WORSE.
THIS HAS BEEN A REAL CALIBRATION
AND CHANGE IN DYNAMICES THAT
THEY HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH
A NEW OPPONENT THAT HAS HAD
DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP WITH TH
DEMOCRATIC BASE AND POTENTIALL
WITH SOME OF THE VOTERS THAT ARE
STILL UNDECIDED.
THEY ARE HAVING TO PIVOT THE
STRATEGY IN REALTIME HERE.
WE ARE WATCHING THAT PLAY OU
HERE
>> DASHA BURNS, THANK YOU.
I WANT TO BRING IN STEVE
KORNACKI
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS ARE MAKING
SEVEN STOPS NEXT WEEK IN EACH OF
THE TOP BATTLEGROUND STATES.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOU
THE PATH THAT THE HARRIS
CAMPAIGN SEES TO GET TO TH
WHITE HOUSE?
>> A COUPLE OF WAYS TO LOOK AT
THIS
WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THERE AR
SIX CORE BATTLEGROUNDS
THEY SAY NORTH CAROLINA IS RIGHT
IN THERE
NORTH CAROLINA IS A LITTLE
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER
BATTLEGROUND STATES IN THIS WAY.
ALL OF THE OTHER BATTLEGROUN
STATES WENT BIDEN IN 2020 BU
NORTH CAROLINA WAS STILL A TRUMP
STATE
IF YOU LOOK AT IT THIS WAY
BEFORE HARRIS GOT IN THE RACE,
BEFORE SHE GOT TO JOE BIDEN, THE
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAS LOOKING
AT AN EXTREMELY NARROW PATH.
YOU CAN SEE HARRIS' NAME BUT
WHEN BIDEN WAS THE LIKEL
DEMOCRAT NOMINEE, THE BIDE
FOLKS WERE SAYING THIS WOULD B
THEIR WALL, THEIR FORTRESS
PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN
WISCONSIN.
AND IT WOULD JUST GET THEM T
270.
BIDEN WAS STRUGGLING WIT
NONWHITE VOTERS, HISPANIC VOTERS
AND LAGGING WITH BLACK VOTERS.
SO THE SUN BELT STATES, TH
POLLING WAS THE WORST FOR BIDE
THERE.
WITH HARRIS THE LIKELY NOMINEE
THE QUESTION IS DOES THAT STAR
TO CHANGE.
CAN SHE DO SOMETHING THAT WOUL
ALLOW HER NOT TO HAVE TO WIN ALL
THREE OF THE STATES HERE
IF TRUMP WERE TO SWEEP ALL O
THESE, HE WOULD BE AT 268.
HE WOULD JUST NEED ONE OF THES
STATES IN THE BIG TEN COUNTRY.
WHAT IF HARRIS IS ABLE TO PICK
OFF, POLLING IS SUGGESTING THA
SHE IS DOING BETTER WITH
HISPANIC VOTERS AND THERE IS A
SUBSTANTIAL HISPANIC POPULATIO
IN GEORGIA
IF SHE WERE TO LOSE MICHIGAN
SHE COULD AFFORD IT.
SO SHE CAN HOPEN UP MORE PATHS
IF SHE IS ABLE TO WIN ANY OF
THESE STATES, IF SHE DOES, I
TAKES THE PRESSURE OF THE STATES
HERE IN THE MIDWEST.
DEMOCRATS SEE THE GROWTH
POTENTIAL RELATIVE TO BIDEN.
THE GROWTH IS WITH NONWHIT
VOTERS IN SUPPORT LEVEL AN
ENTHUSIASM LEVEL
IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PLAY
OUT, AND THAT IS A BIG IF RIGH
NOW, YOU WILL SEE IT MUCH MORE
CLEARLY IN A GEORGIA, IN A
CAROLINA, IN AN ARIZONA, AND
NEVADA THAN A STATE LIKE
WISCONSIN THAT IS 90% WHITE.
SO CAN SHE MOVE THE BATTLEGROUND
AROUND, CAN SHE OPEN UP TH
SOUTH AND NOT HAVE TO RELY O
BIG 10 COUNTRY TRY
>> A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION
RIGHT NOW OVER THE VP PICK I
HOW THAT MAY CHANGE TH
ELECTORAL MAP.
WALK US THROUGH THAT IF YOU CAN.
ARIZONA VERSUS PENNSYLVANIA,
GOVERNOR SHAPIRO VERSUS SENATO
MARK KELLY OR EVEN GOVERNO
WALZ
WHAT IS THE CALCULATION THAT THE
HARRIS S CAMPAIGN IS MAKIN
RIGHT NOW WITH REGARDS TO TH
VICE PRESIDENTIAL PICK
>> IT IS REALLY INTERESTING,
RESETTING THIS HERE, WE HEAR I
ALL THE TIME
IT DOESN'T REALLY HAPPEN THA
MUCH THAT THE PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINEES GO FOR THAT STRATEGY.
AGAIN, RESETTING THE
BATTLEGROUND HERE.
LET'S SAY HARRIS WERE TO PIC
JOSH SHAPIRO, PENNSYLVANIA
19ELECTORAL VOTES.
IT ISSEST OF ANY BATTLEGROUN
STATES AND IT WILL PUT HARRIS AT
245.
AND IT WILL OPEN UP ALL SORTS OF
POSSIBILITIES FOR US
IF SHE HAS PENNSYLVANIA, JUS
GET MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN
IF YOU HAVE PENNSYLVANIA IN YOUR
POCKET AND YOU CAN SAY PICK OF
GEORGIA.
NOW WITHIN 10, NOW ARIZONA WIL
GET HER THERE.
PENNSYLVANIA, BECAUSE IT IS SO
BIG IN TERMS OF ELECTORAL VOTES,
YOU GET PENNSYLVANIA, AND YO
CAN LOSE BOTH BIG 10 STATES.
BUT IF TRUMP WERE TO GET
PENNSYLVANIA AND HARRIS GO
LET'S SAY WISCONSIN INSTEAD, SHE
IS SHORT
OR IF SHE WERE TO GET MICHIGAN
SHE'S SHORT.
SO PENNSYLVANIA OF THE BIG 1
STATES IS PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT.
>> THE MULTITALENTED STEVE
KORNACKI
I UNDERSTAND YOU DO OLYMPI
COVERAGE NOW TO.
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US.
>> CHUCK, WHAT WE JUST TALKE
ABOUT.
DID THE ELECTORAL MAP JUST BLO
UP FOR HARRIS?
I REMEMBER THAT THE BIDE
CAMPAIGN WERE SAYING THEY COUL
DO WELL IN NORTH CAROLINA AN
PEOPLE WERE ROLLING THEIR EYES
>> WE ARE AT GENERIC DEMOCRATI
NUMBERS NOW.
I GET THERE IS A LOT O
ENTHUSIASM
WHEN YOU ARE STARVING EVER
CRACKER TASTES LIKE A RITZ
AND NOW DEMOCRATS ARE IN THA
MODE WITH HARRIS
FINALLY, WE HAVE A BIT OF
CONSENSUS AND IT FEELS STRONG.
WHAT SHE HAS DONE, SHE HAS RISEN
THE FLOOR TO GENERIC DEMOCRATI
LEVELS
AND OF COURSE ALL SEVEN OF THE
STATES ARE IN PLAY
WHEN IT COMES TO THE RUNNING
MATE, YOU SHOULDN'T THINK OF I
BY THIS BUT BY CONSTITUENC
GROUP.
ONE REASON TRUMP WAS
OVERPERFORMING IN THE SOUTH AN
BY BIDEN HAD A SHOT IN THE NORTH
IS THAT INFLATION IS HARDER IN
THE SUNBELT BECAUSE PEOPLE WER
LEAVING THERE.
REAL ESTATE HAS GONE UP HIGHER
IN THE SUN BELT THAN IN TH
NORTHERN CITIES.
THAT IS WHY BIDEN HAD NOT BEEN
WIPED OUT YET BUT HE WAS PLAYING
FROM BEHIND.
I STILL THINK THAT IS
CHALLENGE FOR HER.
TO ME, THE ONLY WAY YOU CA
ACTUALLY WIN THE STATES IS THERE
ARE TWO PEOPLE ON THE SHORT LIST
THAT HAVE A MILITARY BACKGROUND.
NORTH CAROLINA IN PARTICULAR HAS
A LOT OF MILITARY IN IT AND SO
DOES GEORGIA
WITH A MILITARY BACKGROUND, IT
NATURALLY FITS TOGETHER.
SO IF YOU PLAY THE ONE STATE
STRATEGY WITH PENNSYLVANIA,
DON'T KNOW WHERE JOSH SHAPIR
HELPS YOU ANYWHERE ELSE.
BUT KELLY AND WALZ BECAUSE O
THEIR MILITARY BACKGROUND, YOU
CAN'T WIN NORTH CAROLINA WITHOUT
SOME PORTION OF THE WHITE VOTE
AND THAT'S THE MILITARY VETERA
VOTE
SO I THINK WALZ AND KELLY AR
ARE ALSO ON THE SHORT LIST
>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS CREA
AND SUGAR?
>> THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL
FALL
WHAT I MEAN IS IT RAISED THE
FLOOR.
SHE GOT THE GENERIC DEMOCRATIC
VOTE BACK.
