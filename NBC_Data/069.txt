THAT SHE CAN BE THE PROSECUTOR
AND THAT MAKES HER EQUIPPED TO
TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP IN THIS
MOMENT.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, NNAMDI.
AT LEAST EIGHT OR ON THE RADAR
FOR VICE PRESIDENT FULL SO WE
WILL BRING IN TWO REPORTERS WHO
HAVE BEEN COVERING REPORTERS
FOR YEARS AND IN PHOENIX AND
THEN THERE IS IN PHILADELPHIA
LAUREN MAYK WHO HAS BEEN
COVERING GOVERNOR JOSH
SHAPIRO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH
YOU, LAUREN.
WE JUST HEARD FROM DASHA.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT HOW
THIS STACKS UP AND WENT
GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO COULD
BRING TO THE TICKET IN
PENNSYLVANIA?
>> Reporter: GABE, I THINK IF
YOU WERE TO ASK THE
PHILADELPHIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY
THEY WOULD SAY WHAT THEY WOULD
GET WOULD BE PENNSYLVANIA AND
HE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE
DEMOCRATS HERE IN THE STATE OF
PENNSYLVANIA PUSHING FOR
GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO TO
ENJOYING THE HARRIS TICKET.
THE CAMPAIGN TO PUSH FOR
GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO AS THE
VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE
STARTED AROUND THE SAME TIME
THAT THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN
STARTED LAST WEEK, LAST
WEEKEND.
GET STARTED QUICKLY.
WE HAVE SEEN OFFICIALS COME
INTO FOR HIM.
THERE HAS BEEN A MOVE FROM
UNION OFFICIALS OF THE WILL TO
REALLY HYPED HIM UP.
I WAS AT AN EVENT ON FRIDAY
THAT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS PART
RALLY FOR KAMALA HARRIS AND
PART RALLY FOR GOVERNOR JOSH
SHAPIRO.
THEY'RE REALLY PUSHING FOR HIM.
WE ARE IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY
RIGHT NOW IN THE PHILADELPHIA
SUBURBS.
THIS IS AN AREA WHERE PRESIDENT
BIDEN SUPERGIANT HIS VOTES IN
2020.
GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO RAN EVEN
AHEAD OF WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN
DID IN HIS OWN RACE IN 2022
OF COURSE THIS IS NOT HIS HOME
COUNTY, BUT THAT WAS ALSO THE
SAME IN BUCKS COUNTY AS WELL AS
IN ERIE COUNTY IN NORTHWEST
PENNSYLVANIA.
SO HE DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO
PLATE WELL NOT JUST IN HEAVILY
DEMOCRATIC AREAS BUT IN OTHER,
MORE PURPLE AND EVEN SOME RIG
AREAS AS WELL.
I WILL POINT OUT THAT THERE IS
ALSO PUSHBACK AND THERE IS AN
AD RUNNING AGAINST GOVERNOR
JOSH SHAPIRO TO SAY HE HAS NOT
GOTTEN ANYTHING DONE.
THERE IS ALSO SOME DEMOCRATS
WHO ARE NOT HAPPY WITH SOME OF
HIS POSITIONS ON SCHOOL
VOUCHERS.
SO TO HIS BEEN TALKED ABOUT
HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA PER GABE?
>> YOU MENTIONED STRENGTHS AND
WEAKNESSES.
HOW DO YOU THINK THE HARRIS
CAMPAIGN DIRECT TO THAT AND DO
SOME MORE OF THE POTENTIAL
WEAKNESSES THAT YOU SEE
LOCALLY?
I KNOW THERE WAS TALK ABOUT
SOME OF HIS STAFFERS AT SOME
POINT AND HIS RESPONSE.
DO YOU THINK THIS MIGHT BE
AGAINST HIM IF HE BECOMES A
VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE?
>> Reporter: IT WAS SOMETHING
THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY THE
NOMINEE WHO POSTED ABOUT WHAT
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. THERE
WERE CLAIMS AGAINST A STAFF.
THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT AND SET
THROUGH SUPPORT WITH ROY
COOPER, GOVERNOR COOPER INSTEAD
OF GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO.
I SPOKE WITH THE HEAD OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN
PENNSYLVANIA ABOUT THAT POST BY
THEIR NOMINEE AND HE SAID HE
WAS OFFENDED BY THAT AND IS
BACKING GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO
FOR THIS.
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL,
BUT HOW WILL THE HARRIS
CAMPAIGN VIEW THAT?
WE WILL SEE.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH PAY LAUREN
MAYK LIVE IN PENNSYLVANIA .
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, LAUREN.
WHAT ARE THE STRENGTHS OF
SENATOR MARK KELLY?
>> IS MARRIED TO GABBY GIFFORDS
AND IS A MODERATE DEMOCRAT AND
NOT AFRAID TO PUSH BACK AND
PLAYS VERY WELL WITH
REPUBLICANS AND INTRA-THERE WAS
SOME TRUMP-KELLY DISTRICTS
DURING THE ELECTION AND
DISTRICT FOR THE VOTERS WENT
FOR BOTH SENATOR MARK KELLY
AND DONALD TRUMP AND OF COURSE
HE HAS THE BORDER GOING FOR
HIM AND THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM
FOR KAMALA HARRIS HERE IN
ARIZONA, AND EVEN ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.
SENATOR MARK KELLY NOT AFRAID
TO PUSH BACK AND SAID AND IN
TITLE 42 WAS , QUOTE, DUMB.
JUST THIS MORNING INTERVIEWED
RUBEN GALLEGO AND HE DID NOT
HAVE AN ANSWER.
YOU WENT TODAY TALKING OINT
IS A REAL ISSUE FOR KAMALA
HARRIS AND ONE WHERE IT IS
DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHERS.
>> YOU HAVE NOT SEEN HIM ON TV
MUCH. HE CAN HANDLE SO THAT HE
IS NOT A SPEAKER IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR INTEGRATE WITH J.D.
VANCE HE WILL GET A SOLID
PERFORMANCE AND IN THE PAST
THERE IS THIS ISSUE WITH THIS
BALLOON COMPANY IN TUCSON THAT
HE HELPED TO GET OFF OF THE
GROUND. THE GOAL WAS TO
DEVELOP SPACE TOURISM.
THAT NEVER REALLY HAPPENED.
IT DID HAVE A SMALL INVESTMENT
BY A CHINESE COMPANY AND HE
TALKED TO AN EXECUTIVE AND ALSO
QUESTIONS ABOUT TAX BREAKS FROM
THE CITY OF TUCSON AND WHETHER
OR NOT THERE WAS A RETURN ON
THAT INVESTMENT.
THAT'S KIND OF MELTED AWAY AND
THAT IS BEEN OUT THERE IN THE
PUBLIC DOMAIN. WE REALLY DO NOT
KNOW HOW T
