>>> TONIGHT, A MAJOR ENDORSEMENT IN THE 2024 RACE. AS FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP GETS HIS SIT DOWN WITH THE ISRAELI
PRIME MINISTER. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? AND THE TERRIFYING IMAGES
COMING FROM OUT WEST. WILD FIRES RAGING OUT OF
CONTROL. THEN, IN FRANCE, AN UNSETTLING KICKOFF FOR THE SUMMER OLYMPIC
GAMES AND MASSIVE SABOTAGE ATALKS ON THE COUNTRY'S RAIL SYSTEM THAT LOOMS OVER THE
OPENING CEREMONIES. >>> AND THE LOOMING BATTLE ON JD VANCE'S WORDS ON CHILDLESS
PEOPLE. WHY IT IS PUTTING THE SPOTLIGHT ON A CRUCIAL GROUP OF VOTERS.
MOMS. >>> AND THE EXCLUSIVE SITDOWN WITH THE TRANSGENDER DAUGHTER
ELON MUSK DISOWNED. WHAT SHE TOLD US AFTER WHAT SHE
SAID MUSK SAID TO HIM. >>> WE WILL START DOWN WITH
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND BB NETANYAHU AT MAR-A-LAGO.
WE SAW VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS MAKE THE RARE COMMENTS DESCRIBING IT AS FRANK, ALSO
CONSTRUCTIVE SAYING IT IS TIME TO GET A CEASE FIRE DEAL DONE. IT WAS HARRIS WHO GAVE THAT
PUBLIC ADDRESS AND NOT THE PRESIDENT WHO ALSO MET WITH THE PRIME MINISTER. WITH ALL THREE POLITICIANS.
BIDEN, HARRIS, TRUMP. PROBABLY TRYING TO PUSH FOR A DEAL WITH THE GEO POLITICAL TENSIONS HAVING AN IMPACT ON
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. AND KAMALA HARRIS WITH CRUCIAL BACKINGS FROM THE MOST POPULAR DEMOCRATS. THE HARRIS CAMP PUT DOWN A NEW
VIDEO OF BARACK OBAMA AND MICHELLE OBAMA PLEDGING THEIR FULL SUPPORT MEANING WE CAN LIKELY EXPECT TO SEE BOTH OF
THEM AT RALLIES SOON. HARRIS HEADED TO A KEY STATE,
GEORGIA. AND AN ENDORSEMENT AS TENSIONS ARE RATCHETING UP WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYING THE
FORMER PRESIDENT WON'T COMMIT TO A DEBATE UNTIL HARRIS IS
FORMALLY NOMINATED. PUTTING THAT SEPTEMBER DATE IN QUESTION. WE HAVE TEAM COVERAGE ON ALL OF THE LATEST. WE HAVE JESSE KIRSCH FOLLOWING
THE TRUMP CAMP IN FLORIDA BUT WE WANT TO START WITH ALI NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE. I WANT TO START WITH THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL. AND THE SIGNIFICANCE REALLY OF THIS ENDORSEMENT FROM THE
OBAMAS. >> THIS IS A MOMENT. >> Reporter: WE SAW SO MANY
PROMINENT DEMOCRATS START TO BACK VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS. BUT THE OBAMAS HELD OFF ON THIS WHILE IT WAS EXPECTED SO
CRITICAL ENDORSEMENT AND WE ARE TOLD THAT WAS FOR A FEW
REASONS. WANTED TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT HIS MOMENT WHEN HE DELIVERED
THE OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS. HE DIDN'T WANT TO APPEAR AS IF HE WAS PUTTING HIS FINGER ON THE SCALE FOR VICE PRESIDENT
HARRIS. HE WANTED TO GIVE DEMOCRATS THE TIME TO RALLY AND HER AND SUPPORT HER AS WE KNOW SHE NOW
HAS ENOUGH DELEGATES TO SERVE AS THE DE FACTO DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. AND WE ARE TOLD THAT THE OBAMAS
HAVE BEEN SERVING SORT OF AS A SOUNDINGBOARD FOR HER OVER THE LAST FIVE DAYS SINCE THE
PRESIDENT DROPPED OUT AND THEN ENDORSED HIS VICE PRESIDENT. THE VICE PRESIDENT IN THAT
VIDEO, THE PHONE CALL SHE SHARED WITH THE OBAMAS, SHE TELLS THEM SHE IS READY TO GET ON THE ROAD. WE ARE TOLD FROM THE SOURCES.
BOTH OF THEIR AIDES THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE LOGISTICS AROUND HOW THEY COULD
APPEAR ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL
TOGETHER. NO DATE HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY SET FOR THAT. BUT YOU THINK OF HOW MUCH MORE VISIBLE FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA
HAD BEEN IN RECENT MONTHS WHERE THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN APPEARING WITH HIM AT SEVERAL HIGH
PROFILL FUNDRAISERS. SOME OF THEIR HIGHEST GROSSING FUNDRAISERS. THAT IS ONLY EXPECTED TO GET
MORE ATTENTION FOR THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN. >> THEY WERE A MAJOR PART OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN BACK IN 2020
ACTING AS FREQUENT SURROGATES. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE VP VETTING PROCESS. WE ARE NOW GETTING REPORTING
THEY ARE DEEPLY VETTING SOME OF THESE POSSIBLE VP CANDIDATES
HERE. >> WE KNEW THAT THIS HISTORICALLY FAST PROCESS WAS UNDERWAY FOR SOME OF THE
POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES OF VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS. BUT THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS FOR THE FIRST TIME PUBLICLY
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. A HARRIS CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON SAYING IN A STATEMENT IN PART THAT THE PROCESS HAS BEGUN IN EARNEST AND WE DO NOT EXPECT TO
HAVE ADDITIONAL UPDATES UNTIL THE VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES WHO WILL BE SERVING AS HER RUNNING MATE AND AS THE NEXT
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AS FAR AS WE KNOW, FOR SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS IS
THAT FIVE RUNNING MATES ARE CURRENTLY BEING VETTED. MOST OF THEM ARE DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNORS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE
LIKE NORTH CAROLINA. ROY COOPER.
GRETCHEN WHITMER. PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO AND SOME OTHERS.
THE VICE PRESIDENT UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO HEAD THIS SEARCH AS SHE HAS BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF IT WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. >> THE DEMOCRATS ARE IN A
UNIQUE POSITION HERE. THEIR CANDIDATE IS NOT THE INCUMBENT, BUT IN THE WHITE
HOUSE. IT WAS KIND OF WIDELY SEEN THAT KAMALA HARRIS WAS SOMEWHAT PUT ON THE BACK BURNER.
SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZED WHY SHE WASN'T MORE OUT FRONT. AND NOW THESE HISTORIC CHANGES
HAPPENING. POSTURING INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. IT WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT ADDRESSING THE NATION.
NOT THE PRESIDENT AS WE WOULD NORMALLY SEE. CAN WE EXPECT MORE ROLES LIKE
THIS LEADING UP TO NOVEMBER AS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS
PROPPING HER UP? >> YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND THE WHITE HOUSE AND HER OFFICE SPECIFICALLY IS WELL AWARE THE
EYES OF THE POLITICAL WORLD ARE ON HER NOW MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. AND THEY REALLY SEE HER COME INTO HER OWN OVER THE LAST TWO
YEARS SINCE THE DOBBS DECISION BECOMING THE FACE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS. THE FIGHT TO PROTECT
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. YOU MENTIONED THE ADDRESS SHE GAVE. THAT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A SEPARATE MEETING BEFORE THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION, BUT OF
COURSE, THE FOCUS EVEN MORE ON HER NOW SO THIS WILL BE A
BALANCE SHE HAS TO STRIKE THE NEXT 100 OR SO DAYS. KNOWING THE EYES OF THE POLITICAL WORLD ARE WATCHING
EVERYTHING SHE SAYS AND DOES. WHILE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE UP
FOR LOST TIMES ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. >> THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT. >>> LET'S GO TO JESSE KIRSCH
STANDING BY FOR US. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS MEETING
HAPPENING BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP. >> WHAT WE KNOW IS IT APPEARS THAT THE PRIME MINISTER AND FORMER PRESIDENT MET FOR AROUND
TWO HOURS AT THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S HOME MAR-A-LAGO. JUST ACROSS THE WATER NOW, WE
ARE AWAITING REMARKS FROM THE
FORMER PRESIDENT. THE PRESS WAS BRIEFLY ALLOWED IN. AND HEARD FROM BOTH CANDIDATE
TRUMP AND PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU. HE HOPES THE VISIT WILL BRING
THE STATE OF ISRAEL CLOSER TO A
CEASE FIRE DEAL. WITH HAMAS. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP BOASTING AND TAKING SWIPES AT KAMALA HARRIS. AT ONE POINT SAYING HE COULDN'T
IMAGINE HOW A JEWISH AMERICAN VOTER COULD BE VOTING FOR HER BASE ON HER STANCES. >> I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT
SOME OF THE RALLIES HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND WHEN IT COMES TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT LEARNING NOW THAT HE IS GOING TO GO BACK
TO BUTLER PA FOR A RALLY TO
HONOR COREY COMPORATORE. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT? >> Reporter: YEAH, IN A TRUTH SOCIAL POST, THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAYING THIS WILL BE
TO HONOR THE BRAVE PATRIOTS INJURED TWO WEEKS AGO AND HE CONCLUDES BY SAYING QUOTE, FIGHT BY STATE, STAY TUNED FOR
DETAIL. FIGHT BY FIGHT HAS BECOME A COMMON REFRAIN. WHAT HE SHOUTED FROM THE PODIUM
WHEN HE GOT BACK UP AFTER THE SHOTS RANG OUT. >> I TALKED ABOUT A POTENTIAL
DEBATE HERE. KAMALA HARRIS SAYING BRINGING. LET'S DO IT. DONALD TRUMP'S TEAM SAYING WE WILL WAIT. WHO KNOWS WHO WILL BE AT THE
TOP OF THE TICKET DESPITE THE FACT KAMALA HARRIS IS THE
LIKELY NOMINEE. , SHE HAS CURRED THE DELEGATES. NONETHELESS, DO WE THINK THIS DEBATE WILL EVEN HAPPEN BETWEEN
THESE TWO? >> Reporter: WELL, AT THIS POINT, OBVIOUSLY NOTHING IS
FIRM. THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAYING THEY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THINGS ARE OFFICIAL WITH THE
DEMOCRATIC TICKET TO BE CONFIRMING A DEBATE. THIS IS PART OF THE BACK AND
FORTH WE ARE SEEING. A SIGN OF MORE TO COME. AT THIS POINT, WE ARE STILL
WAITING TO SEE WHO WILL BE IN
THE FULL DEMOCRATIC TICKET. WHO HER PICK WOULD BE IS STILL
IN QUESTION. >> THAT POTENTIAL DEBATE DATE, DONALD TRUMP WILL BE SENTENCED, THAT DATE UP IN THE AIR AS WELL
IN MANHATTAN. JESSE KIRSCH, APPRECIATE IT. >>> BREAKING NEWS OUT OF OREGON WHERE THE DESPERATE SEARCH OF A PILOT OF A MISSING AIR TANKER
HAS COME TO A TRAGIC END LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER THAT DIFFICULT SEARCH. THE PILOT HAS IN FACT DIED.
WE ARE GETTING THIS AS WE ARE GETTING A TERRIFYING LOOK AT NEW IMAGES OUT OF CALIFORNIA WHERE WILD FIRES ARE RAGING OUT
OF CONTROL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FIRENADO
SPOTTED LAST NIGHT. THAT'S A RARE PYRO TORNADO WHIRLING IN THE SKY HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE FLAMES AS THE
PARK FIRE TEARING THROUGH THE FOREST. THERE'S A LOT MORE TO COME.
A RED FLAG WARNING IS IN
EFFECT. MORE THAN 165,000 ACRES HAVE
ALREADY BURNED. 5,000 PEOPLE OR MORE WERE TO EVACUATE FROM BUTTE AND TAHOMA
COUNTY. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE
PAYROLL WHO WAS KILLED? PILOT WHO WAS KILLED? >> Reporter: WE KNOW THE PLANE
CRASHED AT AROUND 11:30 P.M. LAST NIGHT. THE PILOT WAS THE ONLY CREW MEMBER ON BOARD.
THIS IS AN AIR TANKER THAT CARRIES ABOUT 800 GALLONS OF
WATER OR FIRE RETARDANT TYPICALLY MANNED BY ONLY ONE PERSON AS WAS THE CASE HERE, THE CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING UP TO THE CRASH ARE STILL NOT CLEAR
AND THE FAA IS INVESTIGATING BUT THIS IS THE FIRST FATALLY
OFFICIALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE FALL FIRE IN OREGON WHICH IS AT
THIS POINT ABOUT 55% CONTAINED. >> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DAMAGE. THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF
ACRES, DAMAGED HOMES AS WELL
>> Reporter: THAT FIRE IS BEHAVING IN WHAT EXPERTS DESCRIBE AS EXTREME WAYS TODAY.
THE COMBINATION OF THE HEAT, THE DRYNESS, THE WIND, THE AMOUNT OF DRY, VEGETATION, FUEL
THAT IS FUELING THIS FIRE. IT IS GROWING EXTREMELY FAST WITH A LOT OF SPOTTING
IT IS ACTUALLY CLOSE TO 180,000 ACRES NOW. WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
YESTERDAY, ABOUT 45,000. IT IS GROWING EXTREMELY FAST. IT IS NOT EXPECTED TO STOP GROWING ANY TIME SOON. BECAUSE THOSE CONDITIONS THAT I
DESCRIBED ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE DAY.
THE FIRE WAS AT 3% CONTAINED NOW IT IS 0%. >> GOING IN THE WRONG
DIRECTION. DAVID, THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. >>> OKAY, LET'S TAKE A BREATH.
THE DAY FINALLY ARRIVED. THE SPECTACULAR, A BIT RAINY
OPENING CEREMONY. ALL ALONG THE ICONIC RIVER SEINE. FILLED WITH FIREWORKS, DANCING, MUSIC, AND THE PARADE CARRYING
THOUSANDING OF OLYMPIC ATHLETES TO KICK OFF THE GAME. HOURS EARLIER, A MASSIVE ATTACK ON THE FRENCH RAIL SYSTEM
SETTING FIRES TO HIGH SPEED RAIL SIGNAL CABLES AND CAUSING
MASSIVEBACKUPS AT TRAIN STATIONS. AROUND A MILLION PASSENGERS
GOING TO BE EFFECTED. WE SEE KEIR SIMMONS IS COVERING IT ALL FOR US WITH AN UMBRELLA
INTACT. I GOT TO SAY. AT LEAST YOU DON'T HAVE THE
PONCHO LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. I WAS WATCHING THE OPENING CEREMONIES AND YOU GAVE US A TEASER OF IT. BUT THE USE OF THE CITY AND THE
MONUMENT WAS SO SPECTACULAR UNLIKE ANYTHING WE HAD EVER
SEEN BEFORE. >> THEY'RE SO RIGHT. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THIS, YASMIN THAT IS SO FAMILIAR, ALL THE
THINGS YOU WORRY ABOUT. WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT RAINS BECAUSE
GOODNESS ME, IT RAINS. THEY HAD A PARTY AND BATTLED THROUGH IT. YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING NADAL
AND WILLIAMS, TENNIS STARS, ON A BOAT CARRYING THE OLYMPIC
FLAME UP THE SEINE TO WE ASSUME THE OLYMPIC CALDRON SOMEWHERE.
IT HAS BEEN A SPECTACULAR
PERFORMANCE. BY HAVING THE WHOLE THING ON THE SEINE, YOU HAVE THE PARADE
AND THE PARTY AT THE SAME TIME. WE HAD A PERFORMANCE FROM LADY
GAGA WHILE THE ATHLETES WERE ON BOATS DOWN THE RIVER. AND TEAM USA CAME RIGHT PAST US
HERE WITH LEBRON JAMES AND COCO GOFF CARRYING THE FLAG FOR THE U.S. THE SECOND FROM LAST BOAT.
BECAUSE THE U.S. IS THE NEXT SUMMER GAMES, WILL HOST THE SUMMER GAMES SO IT IS A
TRADITION, THAT BUILDS THE MOMENTUM. MADE FOR AN AMAZING FINALE.
IT WAS POURING. STILL, THEY LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE JUST ENJOYING IT.
WHO COULD BLAME THEM? IT WAS SUCH AN INCREDIBLE MIX OF MUSIC AND CULTURE. THE KIND OF THING THAT ONLY THE
FRENCH CAN DO. PRESIDENT MACRON ANNOUNCED IN THE GAMES THAT WERE BEGINING THE. AND AGAIN, WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHERE THAT CALDRON WILL BE, WHERE THE OLYMPIC FLAMES WILL BURN AND WHETHER THERE WILL BE
A PERFORMANCE, MAYBE FROM CELINE DION FOR EXAMPLE. >> GIVING US A POSSIBLE TEASER THERE. I SAW THE LADY GAGA
PERFORMANCE. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE RAIN
COMING DOWN. THE MAJESTY OF PARIS COMING DOWN THE RIVER SEINE. BUT ALSO, I'M SURE ALL OF THEM TAKING IN JUST HOW INCREDIBLE
IT WAS THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES. ALL THAT HARD WORK TO FINALLY
GET THEM THERE. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THEY WERE FEELING. HOW ARE FOLKS IN PARIS FEELING?
WHAT IS THE VIBE LIKE ON THE GROUND THERE? >> Reporter: IT WAS A LOT OF
FUN. IT WAS A LOT OF FOLKS ALONG THE RIVER HERE. WE WERE HERE UP ON THE BALCONY.
THE APARTMENT OF A WOMAN FROM
NEW JERSEY. A GREAT WOMAN WHO LET US COME AND JOIN HER WATCH PARTY. THERE WERE ABOUT 15 FOLKS
CHEERING TEAM USA AND THEY CAME BY. IT HAS BEEN DECADES SINCE IT
RAINED LIKE THIS AT AN OPENING CEREMONY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE WEATHER MAP, THE REST OF FRANCE APPEAR TO BE
DRY. AND PARIS HAS STORMS COMING OVER THE CITY. JUST AT THE POINT WHEN THE
OPENING CEREMONY WAS ON. BUT IN A WAY I THINK IT WAS
KIND OF POETIC. IT WAS A BUNCH OF ATHLETES BATTLING OVER THE WEATHER.
>> EXACTLY. THEY SAY WHEN YOU ARE GETTING MARRIED AND IT RAINS IT MEANS
GOOD LUCK. TRY AND STAY DRY. >> IN THIS IS JUST THE WARMUP FOR THE SWIM AT THE END.
>>> THE FDA IS ASKING THE DISTRIBUTER TO CRAWL THIS GROUND CINNAMON PRODUCT.
THIS WAS AFTER OTHERS WERE FOUND TO HAVE LEAD IN THEM AND IT CAN BE EXTREMELY TOXIC,
ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. I WANT TO BRING IN THE DOCTOR FOR MORE ON THIS. THANKS FOR JOINING US ON THIS.
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT OFFICIALS ARE NOW FINDING MORE AND MORE CINNAMON PRODUCTS WITH
LEAD IN THEM AND DOES THIS MEAN WE SHOULD JUST STOP EATING
CINNAMON? WHAT SHOULD WE DO? >> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. IT STARTED LAST YEAR WHEN A
BUNCH OF PARENTS STARTED TO NOTICE THEIR KIDS HAD HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD. THIS IS ACTUALLY TRACED BACK TO APPLE SAUCE THAT HAS SINCE BEEN
RECALLED. THAT APPLE SAUCE ACTUALLY HAD CINNAMON IN IT. CINNAMON FOUND TO HAVE REALLY HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD. SO THE FDA ESSENTIALLY HAS BEEN
TESTING GROUND CINNAMON PRODUCTS SINCE THE OUTBREAK AS THEY TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WIDESPREAD IT IS. I TALKED TO A FOOD SAFETY ISSUE
ABOUT THIS. THE ISSUE IS THAT WE DON'T TEST FOOD PRODUCTS BEFORE THEY COME TO MARKET FOR HEAVY METAL
CONTAMINATION. WE WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO GET SICK AND TEST THEM. SO FOR THE PEOPLE WORRIED. IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE.
THE SMARTEST THING TO DO IS JUST LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE TO CINNAMON IF YOU HAVE CINNAMON
OATMEAL, SWITCH IT OUT. AND TRY TO JUST REDUCE CINNAMON AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. YOU DON'T NEED TO ELIMINATE IT COMPLETELY.
>> I WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE, IS THERE AN AMOUNT OF LEAD IN ANYTHING THAT IS ACTUALLY SAFE THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO
CONSUME? >> NO. ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN. PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN HERE. YOU WANT TO WATCH OUT. HIGH LEVELS, EVEN LOW LEVELS OF
LEAD CAN LEAD TO LOW IQ AND LEARNING PROBLEMS SO FOR THOSE OUT THERE WITH YOUNG KIDS IT IS IMPORTANT YOU TAKE THIS MESSAGE
SERIOUSLY. >> THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. >>> ALL RIGHT, NBC NEWS IS LEARNING THAT VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS CALLED THE FAMILY OF AN ILLINOIS WOMAN KILLED BY
POLICE SONYA MASSEY'S FATHER SAYING QUOTE THE CALL MADE ME FEEL A LOT BETTER. IT IS HAPPENING AS WE ARE
GETTING A NEW AUTOPSY REPORT THAT SHE WAS KILLED BY A GUNSHOT TO THE HEAD.
SHE WAS SEEN ON BODY CAM VIDEO GETTING SHOT BY A SHERIFF DEPUTY AFTER SHE CALLED 911
ABOUT A SUSPECTED PROWLER. CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY BEN CRUMP SAYS HER PLEAS FOR HELP WERE
IGNORED. >> SHE WAS TRYING TO GET HELP. SHE NEEDED A HELPING HAND.
NOT A BULLET TO THE FACE. SHE JUST NEEDED THOSE OFFICERS
TO EXTEND ACTS OF HUMANITY. NOT TO KILL HER.
>> THAT BODY CAM VIDEO RELEASED
SHOWED DEPUTY SEAN GRAYSON OPENED FIRE ON MASSEY AFTER ORDERING HER TO DROP A BOILING
POT OF WATER. HE HAS PLEADED NOT GUILTY TO FIRST DEGREE MURDER AND OTHER
CHARGES. MAGGIE VESPA JOINS US NOW. WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW HERE? GIVE US THE DETAILS OF THIS AUTOPSY AND WHAT HAS COME TO
LIGHT HERE. >> Reporter: LET'S START WITH THAT. ACTUALLY CRUMP ZEROED IN ON THAT DRAMATICALLY DURING
TODAY'S PRESS CONFERENCE, THE AUTOPSY RESULTS SHOW NOT ONLY WAS SHE SHOT IN THE HEAD, BUT HER LEFT EYE WITH THE BULLET.
YOU SEE THE RENDERINGS, EXITING THE BASE OF HER NECK AND WHAT THE FAMILY SAYS THAT MEANS CLEARLY AND WE APPEAR TO SEE
THIS IN THE BODY CAM VIDEO IS SHE WAS SHOT AT A DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY MEANING THE DEPUTY
WAS STANDING, SHE WAS CROUCHING DOWN AND WE SAW IN THE VIDEO, SHE SAID I'M SORRY.
AND SHE CROUCHED DOWN MOMENTS BEFORE SHE WAS SHOT. AND THEY SAY THIS JUST MAKES IT ALL THE MORE APPARENT.
IT CONFIRMS WHAT THEY FELT LIKE THEY ALREADY KNEW. SHE WAS COWERING, APOLOGIZING, SHE WAS NOT A THREAT IN THE
MOMENT AND THIS WAS IN THEIR MIND A VERY CLEAR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE. HERE IS SOME OF WHAT WE HEARD
EARLIER TODAY ABOUT THIS. >> SHE WAS STOOPING IN A
DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY BECAUSE OF HER TELLING HIM SHE WAS SORRY.
AND DUCKING. IT MADE THE WHOLE FAMILY FEEL HORRIBLE. >> SO THAT WAS ONE DEVELOPMENT THAT CAME OUT OF TODAY.
THE OTHER ONE, THE FATHER AND MOTHER LIE IS ZEROS IN ON SEAN
GRAYSON'S PATH. HE HAS BEEN EMPLOYED BY SIX DIFFERENT POLICE DEPARTMENTS SINCE 2020 AND HAS A NUMBER OF REASONS KIND OF FOR HIS RECORDS
BEING PULLED IN THE MEANTIME. BEN CRUMP HIGHLIGHTING THIS AGAIN. WE HAVE SOME INSTANCES LAID OUT
THERE OF MISCONDUCT. INCLUDING A SERIOUS OFFENSE THAT WAS CITED IN HIS DISCHARGE FROM THE ARMY IN 2016.
HE ALSO ADMITTED IN ONE JOB APPLICATION TO PAST ALCOHOL ABUSE INCLUDING WHEN HE WAS IN THE ARMY AND QUOTE A LOT IN HIS
LIFE. ACCUSED IN ONE JOB OF TWO INSTANCES OF MISCONDUCT. HIS LAST JOB BEFORE COMING HERE
INCLUDING IN ONE SITUATION WHERE A WOMAN SAID SHE FELT
VIOLATED WHEN SHE WASN'T
COVERED UP. THE SHERIFF HAS JUST RESPONDED TO US SAYING THAT DESPITE THESE
RECORDS, HE, MEANING GRAYSON, WENT THROUGH THE PROPER
PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS DRUG TEST, ALL THE PROPER
PROCEDURES. THE FAMILY SAYS HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAD THE JOB IN THE FIRST
PLACE. >> A LOT COMING TO LIGHT THERE. MAGGIE VESPA, THANK YOU. >>> OKAY, COMING UP, TWO OF
MEXICO'S MOST LEGENDARY DRUG LORDS NOW IN U.S. CUSTODY. HOW ONE OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN
TRICKED INTO COMING NORTH OF THE BORDER. >>> AND BOORS HEAD IS RECALLING
SOME OF THE DELI MEAT AFTER A LISTERIA OUTBREAK. WE WILL TELL YOU WHAT SHOULD BE OUT OF YOUR FRIDGE AND IN THE
TRASH CAN. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
>>> TWO OF THE MOST POWERFUL ALLEGED MEXICAN DRUG LORDS ARE
IN CUSTODY. ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND SAID EL MAYO AS WELL AS JOAQUIN
GUZMAN LOPEZ, SON OF EL CHAPO ARE GOING TO FACE MULTIPLE CHARGES. YOU ARE LOOKING AT EL CHAPO'S SON LANDING IN CHICAGO IN
FEDERAL CUSTODY. NOW AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING ONE OF THE SUSPECTS MAY HAVE TRICKED THE OTHER ONE INTO
GETTING ON A PLANE TO THE UNITED STATES. KEN DILANIAN JOINS US WITH MORE
ON THIS. THIS IS STARTLING AND HUGE NEWS
WALK US THROUGH HOW THIS ARREST WENT DOWN AND HOW TWO MAJOR
LEADERS OF HUGE CARTELS ARE NOW IN U.S. CUSTODY. >> YEAH. GOT TO SAY. I'M A BIG FAN OF THE NETFLIX
SHOW NARCOS AND IT FEELS LIKE IT WAS RIPPED FROM ONE OF THE
SCRIPTS. JUST BIZARRE. GUZMAN LOPEZ IS THE SON OF EL CHAPO. THEY INDICTED HIS BROTHER. AT THAT TIME, THEY SAID THEY
WERE FEEDING THEIR VICTIMS TO TIGERS. SO THESE ARE NOT NICE PEOPLE.
SO, GUZMAN LOPEZ APPARENTLY DECIDED TO TURN HIMSELF IN. HE BROUGHT WITH HIM ONE OF THE MOST WANTED DRUG LORDS IN
HISTORY. 75-YEAR-OLD EL MAYO. HE DUPED HIM INTO GETTING ON
THE PRIVATE PLANE. THEY LAND IN NEW MEXICO. ARRESTED BY FBI AGENTS. NOW THEY ARE FACING OBVIOUSLY
HUGE PRISON TERMS. CONSIDERATION FOR TURNING HIMSELF IN. >> WE KNOW WE HAVE HAD A CONSIDERABLE FENTANYL CRISIS IN
THIS COUNTRY WHICH HAS BEEN ONGOING. REALLY BROUGHT UP THE
CONNECTION THAT THESE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE HAD WITH THE FENTANYL CRISIS.
I WANT TO PLAY THAT FOR FOLKS AND WE WILL TALK ON THE OTHER SIDE. >> FENTANYL IS THE DEADLIEST DRUG THREAT OUR COUNTRY HAS
EVER FACED. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT REST UNTIL EVERY SINGLE CARTEL LEADER, MEMBER, AND ASSOCIATE
RESPONSIBLE FOR POISONING OUR
COMMUNITIES IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE. >> SO WILL THERE BE AN EFFECT NOW THAT THESE TWO ARE IN
CUSTODY SLOWING THE FLOW OF FENTANYL? >> PERHAPS IN THE SHORT TERM.
BECAUSE THIS IS THE BIGGEST IMPORTER OF FENTANYL IN THE UNITED STATES AND THEY ARE IN
DISARRAY. OFTEN VIOLENCE FLOWS FROM THESE LEADERSHIPS. BUT WHAT YOU SEE THROUGHOUT
HISTORY, IN THE LONG TERM, DRUG LORD AFTER DRUG LORD.
AND THE DRUGS KEEP FLOWING. THERE IS SO MUCH MONEY INVOLVED HERE. AND SO MUCH CORRUPTION ON THE
MEXICAN SIDE. ANOTHER CARTEL OR GROUP OF PEOPLE WILL COME IN TO FILL THE VACUUM INEVITABLY. THE BEST WAY MOST EXPERTS THINK
TO SHUT DOWN THE FLOW OF FENTANYL IS TO HAVE CHINA STOP SENDING THE CHEMICAL PRECURSORS
TO MEXICO AND THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET. >> KEN DILANIAN, THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT.
>>> LET'S TALK ELECTION AGAIN. SO AS THIS SEASON IS HEATING
UP, WE ARE HEARING FROM YOUNGER AMERICANS. AND FIRST GENERATION AMERICANS
ARE PLANNING TO LEAVE THE UNITED STATES, GIVING UP THEIR PARENTS' AMERICAN DREAM IN SEARCH OF THEIR OWN DREAM
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY. HERE IS MAYA EAGLIN. >> I THOUGHT I WOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH AMERICA AND THE
AMERICAN DREAM OF MAKING
SOMETHING OF YOURSELF. FEELING PROUD. I CAME TO REALIZE I DON'T WANT THIS LIFE. I'M ACCEPTING OF THAT DREAM.
AND I'M JUST READY TO MAKE NEW DREAMS. >> Reporter: RANIA SALAH IS A
FIRST GENERATION AMERICA. HER PARENTS ARE PALESTINIAN. AFTER STRUGGLING WITH JOB SECURITY AND HER HEALTH, SHE DECIDED TO PACK UP HER ENTIRE
LIFE AND LEAVE THE U.S. FOR GOOD. >> I GRADUATED IMMEDIATELY
STARTED WORKING BUT I HAVE LUPUS SO MY GO, GO, GO WAS KIND
OF COURSE BLUE STOPPED.
>> Reporter: SHE STOPPED. >> Reporter: SHE SHARED ON TIKTOK AND 2.5 MILLION VIEWERS.
>> WHAT MADE YOU REALIZE YOU
NEEDED TO LEAVE? >> THE PAST FIVE MONTHS WHERE I HIT 500 JOB APPLICATIONS. I GOT SO DEPRESSED BECAUSE I
BLAMED MYSELF. ONE DAY I'M SPEAKING TO MY FATHER AND HE ACTUALLY SAID YOU ARE NOT STUCK THERE.
YOU KNOW THAT RIGHT? >> Reporter: SO SHE IS MOVING TO QATAR WITH A PIT STOP IN
TURKEY. SHE SAYS THE FINANCIAL STRESS HERE WAS ANOTHER BIG REASON SHE DECIDED TO LEAVE. >> ON A DAY-TO-DAY, IT LOOKS
LIKE YOUR FRIEND IS ASKING YOU OUT TO EAT AND YOU SAY ACTUALLY I CAN'T. IT IS GOING TO THE GROCERY
STORE AND LOOKING FOR THE DEALS. >> Reporter: THOUGH THE INFLATION SHOWS SIGNS OF
COOLING FOOD PRICES ARE 23% HIGHER THAN FOUR YEARS AGO AND RENT HAS STEADILY INCREASED
WITH THE NATIONAL MEDIAN MONTHLY COST FOR AN APARTMENT CLOCKING IN AT ALMOST $2,000. >> DO YOU THINK THERE ARE ANY
RIGHTS THAT YOU WILL BE GIVING UP ONCE YOU MOVE TO QATAR? >> I'M GOING TO A
SEMICONSERVATIVE MONARCHY. THAT SAID, I'M HAPPY TO GIVE UP MY RIGHT TO VOTE IN EXCHANGE
FOR A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. >> IT IS HARD TO STAY WHERE YOU
ARE AT. >> Reporter: MICHAEL CHRISTIAN JOIN FIRST-DEGREE MARINES AFTER BEING RECRUITED FROM HIGH SCHOOL, BUT EVERYTHING CHANGED
WHEN HE WAS SERVING IN SAUDI ARABIA. >> I HAD CONTRACTED LEUKEMIA
WHILE I WAS THERE. THE STRESS, THE LACK OF SLEEP.
>> Reporter: AFTER STRUGGLING WITH FINDING WORK OUTSIDE THE MILITARY, DEALING WITH DISCRIMINATION AND NOT HAVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE HE WANTS IN
THE U.S., HE IS READY FOR A NEW START IN AUSTRIA NEXT YEAR AND
PLANS TO MOVE TO SPAIN. IT IS ESTIMATED ABOUT 3 MILLION AMERICANS LIVE ABROAD.
RANIA AND MICHAEL WILL KEEP THEIR AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP FOR THE FLEXIBILITY OF WORLD TRAVEL WHICH MEANS THEY WILL STILL PAY
U.S. TAXES. BUT THEY SAY THEY ARE EXCITED TO REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM AMERICAN POLITICS.
>> DO YOU THINK YOU WILL VOTE AT ALL IN NOVEMBER? >> PROBABLY NOT. PROBABLY NOT.
>> EVEN IF I HAD STAYED I WOULDN'T HAVE VOTED IN THE ELECTION EITHER. I THINK WE ARE SEEING NO MATTER
WHICH PARTY IS IN POWER, IT IS KIND OF THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE THE ILLUSION OF FREEDOM
IN AMERICA. >> Reporter: SO RANIA HAS BEEN IN TURKEY A LITTLE WHILE NOW AND BOTH HER MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH HAS IMPROVED
AND SHE SAYS WHILE SHE IS HOPEFUL THINGS WILL GET BETTER IN U.S., SHE DOESN'T REGRET
LEAVING AT ALL. >> THANK YOU TO MAYA EAGLIN FOR THAT. >>> WANT TO GET YOU TO THE FIVE
THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT.
BOARSHEAD RECALLING DELI MEAT
OVER LISTERIA CONCERNS. LIVERWURST TESTED POSITIVE FOR LISTERIA. OVER TWO DOZEN PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN SICK AND TWO PEOPLE HAVE
DIED IN THE OUTBREAK. >>> JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE'S LAWYER SAID THE SINGER WAS NOT DRIVING
DRUNK WHEN HE GOT STOPPED LAST MONTH IN THE HAMPTONS. POLICE DOCUMENTS HAD ERRORS,
PROSECUTORS FILED AN AMENDED DOCUMENT. HE WAS ORDERED TO APPEAR NEXT
WEEK. HE IS ON TOUR IN EUROPE RIGHT NOW. NUMBER THREE, THE GOVERNOR OF WEST VIRGINIA DECLARING A STATE OF EMERGENCY ACROSS THE WHOLE
STATE BECAUSE OF A SHORTAGE OF RAIN THAT LED TO DROUGHT. THE GOVERNOR SAID IT HAS
AFFECTED FARMERS, PUTTING THEM AT RISK OF LOSING EVERYTHING. THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WILL STAY IN EFFECT FOR 30 DAYS
UNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES. >>> NUMBER FOUR, OHIO SUPREME COURT SAYS BONELESS CHICKEN
WINGS ACTUALLY CAN HAVE BONES. I'M SORRY WHAT? A MAN SUED A RESTAURANT SAYING A BONE IN HIS BONELESS WINGS
GOT STUCK IN HIS THROAT LANDING
HIM IN THE ER. THAT THE MAN SHOULD HAVE
WATCHED OUT FOR BONES. >>> TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. A BABY BELUGA. I REMEMBER THAT SONG. NOT IN THE DEEP BLUE SEA, BUT
SWIMMING AROUND IN CHICAGO'S SHED AQUARIUM. 34-YEAR-OLD NAYA GAVE BIRTH TO
IT THIS WEEK. OH MY GOSH, WHAT A CUTIE! >>> STILL TO COME, HOW FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT FROM
CALLING BITCOIN A SCAM TO HEADLINING THE CRYPTO INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST GATHERING AND HOW HIS RUNNING MATE JD
VANCE IS CREATING CONTROVERSY WITH HIS CHILDLESS CAT LADIES COMMENT. SPOTLIGHT PUT ON VOTERS WHO ARE
ALSO MOMS.
>>> NBC COVERS HUNDREDS OF
STORIES EACH DAY. OUR BUREAU TEAMS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE LOCAL.
FROM OUR WESTERN BUREAU. HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY THREE NEW HUMAN CASES OF BIRD FLU
BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES TO 13 JUST THIS YEAR.
THEY ARE EXPERIENCING MILD SYMPTOMS FROM INFECTED CHICKENS AND THE RISK TO THE PUBLIC REMAINS I SHOULD SAY LOW.
>>> OUT OF OUR WESTERN BUREAU, A DETENTION CENTER HAS
MISTAKENLY RELEASED THREE INMATES. TWO ARE STILL ON THE LOOSE. THE THIRD RETURNED ON HIS OWN.
OFFICIALS ARE INVESTIGATING ALL THREE INCIDENTS AND SAY THEY HAVE ADDED A NEW PROTOCOL TO
DOUBLE CHECK. NEW IMAGES OF A BLACK BEAR AND HER CUB WRECKING THE INSIDE OF
A CAR IN CONNECTICUT AFTER GETTING TRAPPED INSIDE. THE HORN AND RADIO WERE ON FULL VOLUME. THEY THINK THEY GOT IN BY
OPENING A DOOR, BUT DON'T KNOW HOW THEY ACTUALLY GOT TRAPPED. ONCE THEY CAME AND LET THE
BEARS OUT, THEY RAN OFF INTO THE WOODS SAFELY. THE CAR CLEARLY NOT AS LUCKY.
>>> BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE NOW WITH DONALD TRUMP TRYING TO
COURT VOTES WITH CRYPTO IN ASH.
THE ANNUAL EVENT INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE ROBERT KENNEDY JR. SPEAKING THERE THE LAST COUPLE
OF MINUTES MEANING WE WILL SEE CRYPTO AND THE TECH INDUSTRY
MORE BROADLY. WE ARE LEARNING KAMALA HARRIS' CAMPAIGN IS PUSHING TO BRING
BACK. LET'S GET TO MAKENZIE WHO IS TALKING MORE ABOUT THIS. TALK ABOUT THE POLITICS GOING DOWN THERE IF YOU WILL.
AND JUST HOW FRIENDLY CRYPTO
APPEARS TO BE GETTING. >> THERE ARE TWO GROUPS HERE.
THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS COURTING. THE FIRST ARE EXACTLY THE KIND OF WALKING AROUND THE HALL.
YOUNG ENTHUSIASTIC. BITCOIN SUPPORTERS WHO TEND TO
LEAD TOWARD DEEWE DEREGULATIONS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO CAME
TO NASHVILLE. THE OTHER GROUP, WELL, SILICON VALLEY AND THE MILLIONAIRE
DONORS. THEY ARE PLEDGED MILLIONS TO
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THEY SAY THEY WILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO
GET TRUMP ELECTED. THE CAPITAL PARTNERS AND THE LIST GOES ON. >> I ALSO KNOW NOW YOU HAVE THE
MAJOR SILICON VALLEY EXECS WORKING THE PHONES. TRYING TO SWAY SOME MAJOR NAMES
IN TECH AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP. MORE TOWARD KAMALA HARRIS'
CAMP. TALK TO US ABOUT THAT. >> Reporter: THERE IS NEW REPORTING THAT FINDS THAT THE TEAM IS LOOKING TO WIN OVER
DEMOCRATIC DONORS NOW THAT SHE IS A DE FACTO NOMINEE FOR THE PARTY. MANY OF THESE PEOPLE WERE
WITHHOLDING SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. BUT NOW THAT HE IS OUT OF THE RACE, THEY ARE APPARENTLY OPEN
TO BEING POACHED. AND KAMALA HARRIS HAS A LONG
TRACK RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. VENTURE CAPITALISTS SAY THE
PIVOT HAS BEEN DRAMATIC AND THIS COMES AS TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE JD VANCE IS SET TO HOLD A
FUNDRAISER OF HIS OWN SO IT DEFINITELY SEEMS TO BE A BATTLE BREWING. >> THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. >>> WANT TO GET TO TONIGHT'S
ORIGINAL. WITH IN-DEPTH REPORTING ON A TOPIC WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING.
APPEARING TO CRITICIZE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE KIDS IN THIS
COUNTRY. ONLINE COMMUNITIES GALVANIZING CALLING KAMALA HARRIS A CHILDLESS CAT LADY.
NOW CHALKING UP TO SARCASM. HIS PAST SUGGESTION THAT PARENTS SHOULD GET MORE VOTES THAN CHILDLESS PEOPLE.
HE IS CALLING THOSE COMMENTS A QUOTE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT. THIS SHOWS HOW AFFAIRS OF THE FAMILY HAVE BECOME CENTRAL TO
AMERICA'S CULTURE WARS BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHTING ISSUES THAT ARE JUST REALLY IMPORTANT TO A LOT
OF VOTERS. CHILD CARE. ONE GROUP IS TRYING TO BRIDGE
THE DIVIDE. >> Reporter: A JAW DROPPING MOMENT IN A DEBATE WITH MANY. >> WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO MAKE
CHILD CARE MORE AFFORDABLE? >> THERE WAS A REAL MOVEMENT TO HAVE A QUESTION IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AROUND
CHILD CARE. AND NEITHER CANDIDATE ANSWERED. AND THAT WAS HURTFUL. >> THIS GUY DIDN'T FIRE
ANYBODY. >> Reporter: BIDEN FINALLY GOT A WORDS IN ON THE TOPIC. >> HE DID VIRTUALLY NOTHING
WITH CHILD CARE. WE SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT. >> Reporter: IT DID NOT IMPRESS
ERIN, THE COFOUNDER OF CHAMBER OF MOTHERS. >> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES AND CONGRESS PEOPLE NOT THINKING ABOUT THESE

WEEKNIGHTS AT 8:00 EASTERN, 5:00 PACIFIC ON NBC NEWS NOW.
>>> I WELCOME BACK ELON MUSK'S DAUGHTER. SPEAKING PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT CRUELTY SHE SAYS
THAT SHE EXPERIENCED FROM HER FATHER AS A CHILD BEFORE SHE CAME OUT AS TRANSGENDER.
AN EXCLUSIVE NEW INTERVIEW WITH
NBC NEWS, SHE SAYS MUSK BERATED HER FOR BEING QUEER AND FEMININE. SHE DECIDED TO SET THE RECORD
CLEAR AFTER MUSK SHARED AN INTERVIEW HE DID WITH A
CONSERVATIVE COMMENTER. HE SAID SHE WAS NOT A GIRL AND
WAS FIGURATIVELY DEAD. HERE IS MORE OF WHAT HE SAID. >> I WAS ESSENTIALLY TRICKED INTO SIGNING DOCUMENTS FOR ONE
OF MY OLDER BOYS. SO I LOST MY SON, SPECIALLY.
>> DAVID INGRAM IS JOINING ME TO TALK ABOUT HIS EXCLUSIVE REPORTING HERE. GIVE ME THE CONTEXT OF THESE
COMMENTS FROM ELON MUSK ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER. AND GIVE US THE RECORD, HIS RECORD WHEN IT COMES TO HOW HE
INTERACTS WITH THE TRANS
COMMUNITY ON THIS PLATFORM. >> ONE WAY TO LOOK AT THIS
ON MONDAY WAS REALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT HE SAID PUBLICLY THAT THE SPARK FOR HIM TO TAKE ON
THIS FIGHT WAS HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS OWN TRANS DAUGHTER. THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT
SHE WAS A GIRL, A WOMAN.
AND TO HIM, THIS IS WHAT HAS BEEN MOTIVATING HIM FOR THIS TIME TO PUSH THE SOCIAL AGENDA.
>> WHAT IS MOTIVATING VIVIEN? SHE HAS BEEN CARRYING THIS AROUND A LONG TIME. BUT WHY SPEAK OUT NOW?
>> I THINK SHE TOOK IT VERY WELL PERSONALLY MONDAY WHEN MUSK DECIDED TO SPEAK ABOUT
HER. HE WENT INTO DEPTH ABOUT HIS MEMORIES OF HER CHILDHOOD.
AND VIVIAN TOLD ME IN OUR INTERVIEW, HE WASN'T REALLY AROUND MUCH FOR HER CHILDHOOD. SHE DESCRIBED HIM AS AN ABSENT
FATHER WHO SPENT MAYBE 10% OF THE TIME HE WAS SUPPOSED TO WITH HER. AND SO SHE REALLY CAST SOME DOUBT ON WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ON
MONDAY. >> BY THE WAY, I WANT TO NOTE THAT ELON MUSK DID NOT RESPOND TO NBC NEWS' REQUEST FOR
COMMENT. DAVID INGRAM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS REALLY IMPORTANT WRAP FOR THIS HOUR.
COVERAGE PICKING UPRIGHT NOW.
>>> A MAJOR ENDORSEMENT IN THE
2024 RACE AS FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP GETS HIS SIT DOWN WITH
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER. WHAT IT ALL MEANS WITH BARELY 100 DAYS UNTIL THE POLLS OPEN. THEN THE TERRIFYING IMAGES COMING FROM OUT WEST.
WILDFIRES RAGING OUT OF CONTRO . WHY OFFICIALS SAY THE WORST IS STILL ON THE WAY.
>>> OVER TO FRANCE, THE OLYMPIC FLAME LIT AFTER SOME STAR- STUDDED PERFORMANCES. WE ARE LIVE FROM PARIS. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
NOW A CRYPTO HEADLINER. WHY HE IS THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT THE INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST CONFERENCE. >>> THE FIRST GENERATION AMERICANS PLANNING TO LEAVE THE
US. WHY THEY SEE THE AMERICAN DREAM NEVER CAME TRUE. >> EVERYBODY, WE ARE GOING TO
START WITH THE SITDOWN BETWEEN FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. HIS LAST OFFICIAL STOP IN THE
US COMING RIGHT AFTER THOSE BIG MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA
HARRIS BACK IN WASHINGTON. WE SAW VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS MAKE THOSE RARE COMMENTS RIGHT AFTER THE SITDOWN DESCRIBING IT
AS FRANK, AS CONSTRUCTIVE,
SAYING THAT IT'S TIME TO GET A CEASE-FIRE DEAL DONE. NOTABLY IT WAS HARRIS WHO GAVE
THE PUBLIC ADDRESS AND NOT THE PRESIDENT WHO ALSO BY THE WAY MET WITH PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU. WE JUST SAW PRESIDENT BIDEN
DEPART THE WHITE HOUSE FOR CAMP DAVID JUST IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES WITH ALL THREE
POLITICIANS. BIDEN, HARRIS AND TRUMP TRYING TO PUSH FOR A DEAL AND CERTAINLY HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. IT ALL COMES AS KAMALA HARRIS
IS DONE GRABBING BACKING FROM THE NATION'S TWO MOST POPULAR DEMOCRATS. THE HARRIS CAMP PUTTING OUT A VIDEO OF BARACK AND MICHELLE
OBAMA ON THE PHONE WITH HARRIS, PLEDGING THEIR SOLE SUPPORT.
MEANING WE CAN LIKELY EXPECT TO SEE BOTH OF THEM AT RALLIES
VERY SOON. HARRIS HEADING TO A KEY STATE, BY THE WAY GEORGIA FOR THE RALLY IN ATLANTA NEXT WEEK. A
KEY ENDORSEMENT AS TENSIONS ARE MOUNTING BETWEEN TRUMP AND HARRIS RATCHETING UP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, NOW SAYING THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL NOT COMMIT TO A
DEBATE UNTIL HARRIS IS FORMALLY NOMINATED. DONALD TRUMP AND
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ORIGINAL DATE NOW IN QUESTION.
WE WILL START WITH ALLIE RAFFA WHO IS NEAR THE WHITE HOUSE FOR
US. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS HUGE ENDORSEMENT FROM THE OBAMA'S.
>> THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY SURPRISING BUT REALLY IT CANNOT BE UNDERSCORED ENOUGH HOW CRITICAL THIS ENDORSEMENT WAS FROM OBAMA TO, EXTREMELY
POPULAR AMONG DEMOCRATS, HOW IMPORTANT THAT WAS FOR VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS AS HER CAMPAIGN TRIES TO KEEP THE MOMENTUM THAT THEY FELT OVER
THE LAST FIVE DAYS GOING FOR THE NEXT 102 DAYS OVER ELECTION DAY.
WE ARE TOLD THAT FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN IN TOUCH AND HAD BEEN IN TOUCH WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS OVER THE LAST FIVE DAYS AFTER THE
PRESIDENT MADE THIS DECISION AND ANNOUNCED HIS DECISION TO DROP OUT OF THE 2024 RACE ACTING AS A SOUNDING BOARD FOR HER THE LAST FIVE DAYS.
HE HELD OFF ON THIS DECISION FOR A FEW REASONS. HE WANTED TO GIVE PRESIDENT BIDEN HIS MOMENT, OF COURSE THE
BIG OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHERE HE EXPLAINED HIS REASONING FOR DROPPING OUT OF THE RACE, AND
HE ALSO WANTED THIS ENDORSEMENT TO STAND ON ITS OWN AND GIVE DEMOCRATS ENOUGH TIME TO RALLY AROUND HARRIS AND NOT LOOK LIKE
HE WAS PUTTING HIS FINGER ON THE SCALE FOR HER. WE HEARD VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS
IN THAT VIDEO THAT FEATURED THIS PHONE CALL EXCHANGE BETWEEN HER AND THE OBAMA'S SAYING THAT SHE WANTS TO GET ON THE ROAD AND IS LOOKING FORWARD
TO THAT. WE ARE TOLD THAT AIDS FOR THE
BOTH OF THEM ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE LOGISTICS AND THE SCHEDULING OF WHEN THEY COULD POSSIBLY APPEAR ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TOGETHER ALTHOUGH NO FINAL DATE HAS BEEN
SET FOR THAT. THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF EYEBALLS ON WHERE AND WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN AND NO DOUBT, HOW MUCH MORE MOMENTUM HAVING THE
OBAMA'S IN HER CORNER WILL BRING TO HER CAMPAIGN VERSUS HOW MUCH MOMENTUM IT GOT TO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
ELSE AND THAT IS HER VP PICK.
HER POTENTIAL VP PICK WHICH SHE HAS TO DO, REALLY IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS OR SO. THEY ARE GOING TO THE VETTING PROCESS AND MANY OF THE NAMES
THAT ARE BEING PUT OUT THERE ARE ALREADY OUT CAMPAIGNING FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT AS
SURROGATES. >> WE KNEW THAT THIS
HISTORICALLY FAST VETTING PROCESS WAS ALREADY UNDERWAY BUT THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE FIRST TIME IS ADMITTING THIS PUBLICLY AND WE HEARD FROM THE
HARRIS CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON WHO SAID IN A STATEMENT IN PART
QUOTE, THAT THE PROCESS HAS BEGUN IN EARNEST AND WE DON'T EXPECT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL UP DATES UNTIL THE VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES WHO WILL BE SERVING
AS HER RUNNING MATE AND THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT THAT DECISION TO BE MADE BY AUGUST 7, GIVING HER
ENOUGH TIME TO BUILD OF THAT MOMENTUM BEFORE THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION BEGINS ON AUGUST 19. WE ARE TOLD FROM SOURCES
FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS THAT IS NOW UNDERWAY THAT STUDYING
MATERIALS HAVE BEEN REQUESTED FROM FIVE POSSIBLE RUNNING MATES
, MANY OF THEM DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS IN STATES THAT WOULD BE CRITICAL TO HER SUCCESS IN NOVEMBER. THESE ARE GOVERNORS LIKE GRETCHEN WHITMER FOR EXAMPLE,
NORTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR ROY COOPER, PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR
JOSH SHAPIRO TO NAME A FEW OF THEM. HARRIS OF COURSE IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO MAKE THIS VERY IMPORTANT DECISION HAVING BEEN ON THE OTHER END OF IT IN 2019.
>> WE ARE ALSO GETTING SOME BREAKING NEWS LITERALLY COMING IN RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE FOUR SOURCES CONFIRMING THAT THE FIRST STAFF LEVEL CALLS FOR POTENTIAL RUNNING
MATE CAN BEGIN ON TUESDAY. TWO SOURCES SAY THAT QUOTE
ABOUT A DOZEN NAMES ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION AND A DECISION WILL HAPPEN BY AUGUST 7. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT IT WILL BE
VERY CLOSE TO THAT TIME. ALLIE RAFFA, THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. WE WANT TO GO TO JESSE KIRSCH,
WEST PALM BEACH AT THE EVENT WERE THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL SPEAK IN JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS MEETING?
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS MEETING WITH FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WINDING DOWN FOR HIS LAST OFFICIAL VISIT. WHAT DID THEY
TALK ABOUT AND WHAT HAPPENED? HOW LONG? >> IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THIS
IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THESE TWO LEADERS CURRENT AND FORMER HAVE MET IN PERSON SINCE FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP LEFT OFFICE BACK IN 2021. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THEY WERE
LONG SEEN AS CLOSE POLITICAL ALLIES BUT A BIT OF A RIFT HAS EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS AS
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP LOST THE ELECTION AND PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ELECTION LOSS.
THIS IS IN A WAY ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEND FENCES AND
FROM THE IMAGES THAT WE'VE SEEN, CERTAINLY SMILES AND EMBRACES.
THE PRIME MINISTER'S WIFE WAS THERE AS WELL AND IT SPEAKS TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS MEETING AND THE MEETINGS AT THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY.
THE CONTRAST THAT STICKS OUT IS THAT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS EMPHASIZED NOT JUST ISRAELI PRIORITIES BUT ALSO CONCERN FOR
THE TREATMENT OF PALESTINIAN PEOPLE IN GAZA WHERE THE READER WE HAVE FROM THE TRUMP TEAM ON
THIS MEETING IN FLORIDA IS REALLY JUST EMPHASIZING SUPPORT FOR THE STATE OF ISRAEL AND I
CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT A BRIEF MEDIA SPRAY ALLOWED INTO THIS MEETING ALSO IN ADDITION TO
SPEAKING ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE US AND ISRAEL, WE ALSO HEARD FROM THE FORMER
PRESIDENT WHO SAYS HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANY JEWISH AMERICAN VOTERS WOULD BE VOTIN
-- NOTING SHE IS MARRIED TO A JEWISH AMERICAN, THE SECOND GENTLEMAN.
>> SPEAKING AT THE EVENT THAT YOU ARE AT RIGHT NOW, WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING FROM HIM THERE? >> THIS IS A FAITH CONFERENCE
INVOLVING WHAT WE ARE TOLD, AROUND 1000 PASTORS.
-- FROM TURNING POINT IS SPEAKING ON THE STAGE AND WE ARE EXPECTING THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO BE HERE LATER AS PART OF THE DAYLONG CONFERENCE
JUST OVER THE WATER FROM WHERE THE FORMER PRESIDENT LIVES.
WE WILL BE HEARING HIM SPEAK LATER TONIGHT AND OF COURSE, THIS BEING A FAITH EVENT WE WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE HOW HE
TAILORS HIS MESSAGE. COMING UP
IN THE AFTERMATH IS THE ASSENTED ITS ASSASSINATION AND THE IDEA THAT HE WAS SAVED BY GOD. HE'S ALREADY SPEAKING TO
SOME VOTERS HERE AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE HERE WHO BELIEVE IT
WAS DIVINE INTERVENTION, ESSENTIALLY, THAT SAVED THE FORMER PRESIDENT. >> I'M GOING TO EXPECT HE WILL ALSO LEAN INTO HIS SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENTS.
JESSE KIRSCH, THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. >>> WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS OUT OF OREGON WHERE THE SEARCH OF A
MISSING TANKER HAS COME TO AN END IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS. THEY ARE CONFIRMING THE PILOT
HAS DIED WHILE BATTLING WILDFIRES. WE ARE GETTING A TERRIFYING LOOK AT NEW IMAGES OUT OF CALIFORNIA. FIRES RAGING OUT OF CONTROL. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FIRE
TORNADO SPOTTED LAST NIGHT. SWIRLING HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE
THE FLAMES JUST NORTH OF CHICO, FIREFIGHTERS ARE SAYING THERE'S MORE TO COME. A RED FLAG WARNING IN EFFECT
AND THEY CAN SPREAD THE FLAMES AROUND EVEN FURTHER. MORE THAN 165,000 ACRES ALREADY BURNED. HOMES UP IN FLAMES. 5000 PEOPLE EVACUATING FROM TWO
COUNTIES. DAVID NORIEGA IS FOLLOWING THIS FOR US. >> LET'S START WITH THE LATEST OUT OF OREGON, THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD NOW INVESTIGATING THE DEATH OF THIS
PILOT. WHAT HAPPENED HERE? >> WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A
SINGLE ENGINE AIR TANKER THAT CARRY FIRE RETARDANT TYPICALLY
MANNED BY ONE PERSON. THAT WAS THE CASE HERE. WE KNOW THAT THE AIRPLANE CRASHED IN THE WOODS IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA, BOTH THE
AIRPLANE AND THE BODY OF THE PILOT HAVE BEEN RECOVERED BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS INVESTIGATING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE. THIS IS THE FIRST FATALITY THAT
OFFICIALS ARE ATTRIBUTING TO THE FIRE UP IN OREGON BURNING MORE THAN 100,000 ACRES AND AT
THIS POINT ABOUT 55% CONTAINED. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE WE ARE SEEING IN CALIFORNIA.
THESE IMAGES ARE STARTLING TO SEE, REALLY SCARY, I IMAGINE, FOR ALL THE FOLKS THAT HAVE HAD TO EVACUATE THEIR HOMES. ANY PROGRESS BEING MADE?
>> NO PROGRESS ON FIGHTING THE FIRE BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS ARE APT FOR THIS FIRE TO GROW FAST
AND CONTINUE GROWING AND TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR CREWS UP THERE TO FIGHT IT.
THIS MORNING, THE FIRE WAS LISTED AT 3% CONTAINED AND IS NOW 0% CONTAINED. ABOUT 134 STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED IN BOTH RESIDENTIAL
AND COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES. THE FIRE STARTED JUST NORTHEAST OF CHICO WITH ABOUT 100,000
PEOPLE, AND IS THANKFULLY GROWING NORTH AND EAST FROM OTHER POPULATION CENTERS IN THE
SOUTH. THERE ARE STRUCTURES IN THE
FIRE ZONE AND IN THE PATH OF THE FIRE WHICH IS WHY WE'VE SEEN EVACUATIONS. GOING NORTH FAR ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY BE
THREATENING HIGHWAY 36 AND SOME OTHER SETTLEMENTS FURTHER UP NORTH. EXPERTS AND CREWS FIGHTING THE FIRE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO
STRUGGLING FOR THE REST OF TODAY AND THE FIRE IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE GROWING. >> THANK YOU DAVID, APPRECIATE IT. >>> WE HAVE MORE BREAKING NEWS.
LEARNING EXCLUSIVELY THAT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS CALLED THE FAMILY OF AN ILLINOIS WOMAN KILLED BY POLICE, SONIA MASSEY'S
-- SONYA MASSEY 'S FATHER TELLING ME THE PHONE CALL MADE
HIM FEEL A LOT BETTER. SHE WAS SEEN ON BODY CAMERA VIDEO RELEASED THIS WEEK GETTING SHOT BY A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY AFTER SHE CALLED 911
ABOUT A SUSPECTED PROWLER. ATTORNEY BEN CRUMP REPRESENTING THE FAMILY AND SAYING HER PLEAS FOR HELP WERE IGNORED.
>> SHE WAS TRYING TO GET HELP. SHE NEEDED A HELPING HAND, NOT A BULLET TO THE FACE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT. >> SHE JUST NEEDED THOSE OFFICERS TO EXTEND HUMANITY,
NOT TO KILL HER. >> THAT BODY CAM VIDEO WAS RELEASED BY POLICE EARLIER THIS
WEEK SHOWING COUNTY DEPUTY SEAN GRAYSON OPENED FIRE AFTER
ORDERING HER TO DROP A BOILING POT OF WATER. HE HAS PLED NOT GUILTY TO FIRST- DEGREE MURDER AND OTHER CHARGES.
MAGGIE VESPA HAS BEEN COVERING THIS FOR US. WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW? GIVE US THE DETAILS OF THE AUTOPSY AND WHAT HAS COME TO
LIGHT. >> I WAS GOING TO SAY LET'S START WITH THAT BECAUSE BEN
CRUMP ZEROED IN ON THAT DRAMATICALLY. THE AUTOPSY RESULTS NOT ONLY SHOWED THAT SHE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD BUT THAT SHE WAS SHOT IN
HER LEFT I EYE. THE BULLET EXITING THE BASE OF HER NECK AND WHAT THE FAMILY
SAYS THAT MEANS VERY CLEARLY, WE APPEAR TO SEE THIS IN THE BODY CAMERA VIDEO, WAS THAT SHE WAS SHOT AT A DOWNWARD
TRAJECTORY MEANING THE DEPUTY WAS STANDING, SHE WAS CROUCHING DOWN AND WE SAW IN THE VIDEO SHE SAID, I'M SORRY AND THEN CROUCHED DOWN MOMENTS BEFORE
SHE WAS SHOT. THEY SAY THIS MAKES IT ALL THE MORE APPARENT AND CONFIRMS WHAT THEY WERE ALREADY KNEW, THAT
SHE WAS COWERING AND APOLOGIZING, SHE WAS NOT A THREAT IN THE MOMENT AND THIS WAS, IN THEIR MINDS, A CLEAR
EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE. >> SHE WAS STOOPING IN A DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY BECAUSE OF
HER TELLING THEM SHE WAS SORRY AND DUCKING.
SHE WAS DUCKING AND IT MAKES THAT WHOLE FAMILY FEEL HORRIBLE.
>> THAT WAS ONE DEVELOPMENT THAT CAME OUT OF TODAY. THE FAMILY IS ZEROING IN ON SEAN GRAYSON'S PAST.
OUR TEAM HAS BEEN UNCOVERING THAT HE HAS BEEN EMPLOYED BY SIX POLICE DEPARTMENTS SINCE 2020 AND HAD A NUMBER OF
REASONS FOR HIS RECORDS BEING PULLED IN THE MEANTIME. SOME INSTANCES WE'VE LAID OUT OF MISCONDUCT INCLUDING A
SERIOUS OFFENSE INCLUDING A
DISCHARGE FROM THE ARMY IN 2016. HE ALSO ADMITTED TO PAST ALCOHOL ABUSE INCLUDING WHEN HE WAS IN THE ARMY", A LOT IN HIS
LIFE. HE WAS ACCUSED AT ONE JOB OF TWO INSTANCES OF MISCONDUCT
INCLUDING ONE SITUATION WHERE A WOMAN SAID THAT IN HER WORDS,
SHE FELT VIOLATED BECAUSE HE WAS LOOKING AT HER WHEN SHE BASICALLY WAS NOT COVERED UP. IN ANOTHER INSTANCE HE HIT A
DEER WITH HIS SQUAD CAR IN A CHASE THAT ACCORDING TO RECORDS, VIOLATED DEPARTMENT POLICY. THE SHERIFF HAS JUST RESPONDED
TO US SAYING DESPITE THESE RECORDS, HE MEETING GRAYSON WENT TO THE PROPER PROCEDURES AND PROTOCOLS AND WAS VETTED BY TWO LOCAL AND OFFICIAL STATE
BOARDS, INTERVIEWED BY MULTIPLE PEOPLE, WENT THROUGH A PSYCHOLOGICAL BACKGROUND CHECK, DRUG TEST, ALL OF THE POSSIBLE PROCEDURES.
HE IS DEFENDING THE HIRING WHILE HIS FAMILY IS-- WHILE HER FAMILY IS SAYING GRAYSON SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAD THAT JOB IN THE FIRST PLACE.
>> A LOT COMING TO LIGHT TO SAY THE LEAST. MAGGIE VESPA, THANK YOU. >>> THE FDA SAYS IT HAS FOUND ANOTHER PRODUCT CONTAMINATED WITH LEAD.
IT IS THIS PRODUCT THAT THE FDA IS ASKING THE DISTRIBUTOR TO
RECALL. NO ONE HAS GOTTEN SICK FROM IT BUT IT COMES AFTER A BUNCH OF OTHER PRODUCTS WERE FOUND TO HAVE LED IN THEM AND OF COURSE
IT CAN BE EXTREMELY TOXIC ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG KIDS.
>> HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT OFFICIALS ARE NOW FINDING MORE
AND MORE PRODUCTS WITH LEAD IN THEM AND DOES THIS MEAN WE SHOULD STOP EATING CINNAMON?
WHAT SHOULD WE DO? >> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN FOLLOWING, THE START OF LAST YEAR WHEN A BUNCH OF PARENTS STARTED TO NOTICE THAT THEIR KIDS HAD A HIGH LEVEL OF BLOOD.
INVESTIGATIVE WORK FOUND THAT THIS HAS TRACED BACK TO APPLESAUCE THAT HAS SINCE BEEN RECALLED. THE APPLESAUCE ACTUALLY HAD
CINNAMON IN IT SO THE FDA HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN TESTING GROUND CINNAMON PRODUCTS SINCE THE OUT
BREAK IN TO FIGURE OUT HOW WIDESPREAD IS THIS? I TALKED WITH A FOOD SAFETY
EXPERT ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY. THE ISSUE IS THAT WE DON'T TEST
FOOD PRODUCTS BEFORE THEY COME TO MARKET FOR HEAVY METAL CONTAMINATION. WE WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO GET SICK AND THEN WE TEST THEM. SO FOR THE PEOPLE WORRIED, THE
SMARTEST THING TO DO IS TO JUST LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE TO CINNAMON. IF YOU HAVE CINNAMON OATMEAL,
SWITCH IT OUT AND TRY TO REDUCE CINNAMON AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. YOU DON'T NEED TO ELIMINATE IT COMPLETELY. >> IS THERE AN AMOUNT OF LEAD
IN ANYTHING THAT IS ACTUALLY SAFE THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO CONSUME?
>> NO, PARTICULARLY FOR CHILDREN YOU WANT TO WATCH OUT BECAUSE HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD OR LOW LEVELS OF LEAD CAN LEAD TO
THINGS LIKE LOW IQ AND LEARNING PROBLEMS. FOR THOSE OUT THERE WITH YOUNG KIDS IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO TAKE THIS MESSAGE SERIOUSLY. >> THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT.
>>> THE 2024 SUMMER OLYMPICS IN PARIS UNDERWAY AND THE OPENING CEREMONY WRAPPING UP WITH A STUNNING OLYMPIC FLAME WRITING BY AN OLYMPIC SPRINTER WHO HAS
THREE GOLD MEDALS, AND ANOTHER WITH THREE GOALS IN JUDO.
THE OLYMPIC CAULDRON FLOATED INTO THE AIR ON A HUGE BALLOON FOLLOWED BY A STUNNING COME
BACK PERFORMANCE FROM A STAGE
HIGH UP IN THE EIFFEL TOWER. IT'S THE FIRST LIVE PERFORMANCE SINCE SHE REVEALED SHE WAS BATTLING A PROGRESSIVE NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE BACK IN 2022. YOU TEASED FOR US IN THE LAST
HOUR AND THEN DURING A COMMERCIAL BREAK I WATCHED SOME OF CELINE DION'S PERFORMANCE.
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.
>> ABSOLUTELY STUNNING.
AS YOU CAN SEE I AM STILL HOLDING AN UMBRELLA AND IT HAS NOT STOPPED RAINING. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE NIGHT. YOU
ARE RIGHT, CELINE DION FROM THE EIFFEL TOWER BEHIND ME THERE SINGING THE END OF THE CEREMONY
WAS JUST INCREDIBLE AND IT BEGAN WITH LADY GAGA PERFORMING. KIND OF-- ENDED BY THESE TWO
EXTRAORDINARY FEMALE PERFORMERS AND THEN THE WHOLE THING WAS JUST BREATHTAKING. DESPITE THE
RAIN, PEOPLE CELEBRATING ALONG THE BANKS OF THE SEINE, THE
ENTIRE TIME AS FAR AS I COULD TELL, OF COURSE YOU WOULD BECAUSE THE PERFORMANCES WERE
JUST SO GREAT. IT MAKES OF MUSIC TO CLASSICAL
IT WAS HARD TO KEEP UP WITH HOW IT WAS MOVING AND CHANGING AND ONE OF THE ASPECTS WHICH I FOUND VERY INTERESTING BY
HAVING THE OPENING CEREMONY OUTSIDE RATHER THAN IN A STADIUM, YOU SAVE MONEY, IT WAS
MORE SUSTAINABLE AND DIFFERENT AND THAT 4 MILES MEANT THEY
WERE ON THE BOAT FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT THEY DID WAS INTERWEAVE THE PERFORMANCES WITH THE
ATHLETES PARADE. I THINK THAT MADE FOR A MUCH BETTER, MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING
OPENING CEREMONY AND FANTASTIC TO SEE LeBRON JAMES AND COCO
GAUFF WAVING THE FLAG ALONG THE
RIVER JUST HERE, JUST BELOW US. IT REALLY WAS A NIGHT TO REMEMBER. IT WAS A NIGHT FOR THE AGES. >> YOU'VE BEEN REPORTING ON
THIS, SEEING THE OPENING CEREMONY FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT. HOW ARE PEOPLE IN PARIS
FEELING? I IMAGINE THERE ARE SO MANY TOURISTS ON THE STREETS OF PARIS
FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND ALSO JUST PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE AND ARE LUCKY TO EXPERIENCE IT FIRSTHAND. >> I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE
WHO LIVES IN PARIS OR WHO IS FROM PARIS CONSIDERS THEMSELVES
LUCKY. WE WERE VERY LUCKY TO BE HERE. WE WERE HERE FOR A WATCH PARTY WITH A WOMAN FROM NEW JERSEY, A
WOMAN CALLED SUSAN. SHE WAS INCREDIBLY GENEROUS TO WELCOME US TO HER HOME.
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE APARTMENT WITH AN AMAZING VIEW. ALONG VERY APPROPRIATELY--
REALLY, RIGHT? A ROAD CALLED THE AVENUE TO NEW YORK. IT ALL SEEMED TO FIT
TOGETHER. WE WERE AT THE WATCH PARTY AROUND 13 PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM FROM THE US WERE CHEERING AS
TEAM USA CAME BY AND JUST ENJOYING THE FRENCH IN US.
AGAIN, IT WAS A NIGHT FILLED WITH CHAMPAGNE AND LAUGHTER. >> HOPEFULLY YOU ARE DRINKING SOME FRENCH WINE AND EATING SOME FRENCH CHEESE AS YOU
WATCHED THE OPENING CEREMONY. A BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT. KEIR SIMMONS, THANK YOU.
IF YOU DIDN'T CATCH THE OPENING CEREMONY WHEN IT AIRED ALIVE, YOU CAN CATCH FULL COVERAGE ON NBC AND PEACOCK 7:30 P.M. EASTERN. LATER ON IN THE SHOW ONE OF THE
WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS CARTEL LEADERS IS IN AN AMERICAN
>>> COMING UP, A BREWING ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER AFTER AN OIL TANKER SINK IN THE PHILIPPINES.
WE HAVE MORE ON THAT IN A SECOND BUT FIRST, ONE OF THE
MOST POWERFUL ALLEGED MEXICAN DRUG LORDS IS IN US CUSTODY AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS ARRESTED THEM IN TEXAS. AG GARLAND SAYING THE COFOUNDER
OF THE SINALOA CARTEL AS WELL AS WALKING GUZMAN LOPEZ, WILL FACE MULTIPLE CHARGES.
YOU ARE LOOKING AT HIS SON HERE. AUTHORITIES SAY ONE OF THE
SUSPECTS MAY HAVE TRICKED THE OTHER ONE INTO GETTING ON AN AIRPLANE.
JOINING US NOW ON ALL OF THIS, WONDERING HOW THIS ALL WENT DOWN AND HOW THEY ENDED UP IN US CUSTODY, THE POSSIBILITY THAT ONE DRUG LORD MAY HAVE
TRICKED THE OTHER ONE INTO GETTING CAPTURED. WALK US THROUGH THE DETAILS.
>> IT'S ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE. I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE STILL HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS BUT WHAT US OFFICIALS ARE TELLING US, THE BASICS IS THAT LOPEZ
WHO IS 37 YEARS OLD AND ONE OF THE SO-CALLED-- RUNNING THE SINALOA CARTEL AFTER THEIR
FATHER WENT TO US FEDERAL PRISON, SAID HE DECIDED HE WANTED TO SURRENDER. HE'S UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE AND THE US IS TRYING TO CAPTURE
HIM. HE DECIDED HE WANTED TO BRING A CONSOLATION PRIZE WITH HIM. ONE OF THE MOST WANTED DRUG LORDS IN MEXICO, L MAILLOT-- EL
MAYO WHO HAS ALWAYS CAREFUL AND HAS NEVER SEEN THE INSIDE OF A JAIL CELL.
HE GOT EL MAYO TO GET ON A PRIVATE AIRPLANE. HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEY ENDED UP IN NEW MEXICO WHERE THEY
WERE ARRESTED BY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES, FLOWN TO EL PASO, TEXAS AND NOW FACING FEDERAL CHARGES. IT IS JUST ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE
, LIKE A SCENE FROM THE MOVIE. IT'S ALSO CONSIDERED A MAJOR VICTORY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT
BECAUSE THIS CARTEL BRINGS IN THE MOST FENTANYL KILLING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS A YEAR. >> I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP. YOU HEARD FROM THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL BRINGING UP THESE TWO MEN AND THEIR CONNECTION TO THE
CRISIS WITH FENTANYL HERE. LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO THAT AND THEN WE WILL TALK. >> FENTANYL IS THE DEADLIEST
DRUG THREAT THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS EVER FACED. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT REST UNTIL EVERY SINGLE CARTEL
LEADER, MEMBER AND ASSOCIATE RESPONSIBLE FOR POISONING OUR COMMUNITIES IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE. >> I KNOW THAT IT'S HARD TO
UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS HOW THESE
CARTELS WORK AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY GET THE DRUGS ACROSS THE BORDER. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE
THESE MAJOR DRUG LORDS UNDER ARREST IN THE UNITED STATES, WHAT DOES IT DO TO THE FLOW OF FENTANYL INTO THIS COUNTRY?
>> IT MAY DISRUPT IT IN THE
SHORT TERM BECAUSE THE SINALOA CARTEL IS THE MAJOR EXPORTER IN THE UNITED STATES AND THEY ARE NOW DISRUPTED AND HAVE A LEADERSHIP VACUUM BUT IT'S NOT
THAT COMPLICATED THE WAY THE MEXICAN CARTELS WORK. IT IS FUELED BY MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY WHICH THEN FUELS
CORRUPTION AND EVEN ON THE US SIDE, THAT'S HOW IT GETS ACROSS
THE BORDER AND THE US HAS BEEN CAPTURING AND JAILING DRUGLORDS FOR DECADES NOW. YOU HAVE THE FLOW OF DRUGS ARE
STILL CONTINUING AND FENTANYL IS THE EASIEST THING TO SMUGGLE BECAUSE IT CAN BE SMUGGLED IN SMALL QUANTITIES. UNLESS SOMETHING CHANGES MASSIVELY AND UNLESS THE US CAN
STOP SHIPPING THOSE CHEMICALS TO MEXICO FROM CHINA, THEY BELIEVE
IT WILL CONTINUE AND OTHERS WILL FILL THE VACUUM CREATED BY
THE LACK OF THE SINALOA CARTEL UNLESS THERE'S A MESSAGE THAT THE US WILL COME AFTER YOU
EXTRA HARD. THAT IS ONE POSSIBILITY AND MOST EXPERTS THINK AS LONG AS THERE ARE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF
MONEY THERE WILL BE CARTELS PEDDLING DRUGS. >> THINK ABOUT NEGOTIATING WITH
CHINA. THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT. >>> AS THE ELECTION SEASON IS
HEATING UP WE HEAR FRUSTRATIONS FROM OTHER AMERICANS ABOUT THE STATE OF THIS COUNTRY AND NOW
YOU HAVE THIRD GENERATION AMERICANS WHO ARE PLANNING TO LEAVE, GIVING UP THE DREAMS OF THEIR PARENTS IN SEARCH OF
THEIR OWN DREAMS SOMEWHERE ELSE. >> I THOUGHT I WOULD FALL IN
LOVE WITH THE AMERICAN DREAM AND AMERICA LIKE PROGRESSING AND MAKING SOMETHING OF YOURSELF AND FEELING PROUD
BECAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT I ACTUALLY DID NOT WANT THIS LIFE. I AM VERY ACCEPTING OF THAT DREAM BEING DEAD AND I AM JUST
READY TO MAKE NEW DREAMS. >> SHE IS A FIRST-GENERATION
AMERICAN BORN IN THE US. HER PARENTS ARE PALESTINIAN. AFTER STRUGGLING WITH JOB SECURITY AND HER HEALTH SHE HAS DECIDED TO PACK UP HER ENTIRE
LIFE AND LEAVE THE US FOR GOOD. >> I GRADUATED IMMEDIATELY STARTED WORKING AND I HAVE LUPUS SO MY GO GO GO WAS KIND OF
FORCIBLY STOPPED. >> SHE SHARED A STORY OF LIVING WITH AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE ON TAKE TALK. >> AMERICA DOES CAUSE A LOT OF
ISSUES AND EXACERBATES IMMUNE DISEASES. >> WHAT MADE YOU REALIZE HE NEEDED TO LEAVE? >> THE PAST FIVE MONTHS, THEY
HIT 500 JOB APPLICATIONS AND GOT SO DEPRESSED. ONE DAY I WAS
SPEAKING TO MY FATHER AND HE ACTUALLY SUGGESTED, YOU'RE NOT STUCK THERE.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT? >> SO RANIA IS MOVING TO QATAR
WITH A PIT STOP IN TURKEY AND SAYS THE FINANCIAL STRETCH WAS ANOTHER BIG REASON SHE DECIDED TO LEAVE.
>> IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR FRIEND IS ASKING YOU OUT TO EAT AND YOU SAY ACTUALLY I CAN'T. IT'S GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE AND LOOKING FOR THE DEALS.
>> NO IN FREIGHT INFLATION SHOWS SIGNS OF COOLING, THEY ARE 22% HIGHER THAN THEY WERE YEARS AGO, AND RENT HAS STEADILY INCREASED SINCE THE
PANDEMIC. THE NATIONAL MEDIAN MONTHLY COST CLOCKING IN AT ALMOST $2000. >> DO YOU THINK ANYTHING YOU
WILL BE GIVING UP? >> I'M GOING TO CONSERVATIVE MONARCHY AND THAT SAID, I AM
HAPPY TO GIVE UP MY RIGHT TO VOTE AS A TRADE FOR A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER QUALITY OF
LIFE.
>> IT'S HARD TO STAY WHERE YOU ARE AT. >> MICHAEL IS CURRENTLY LIVING
IN MARYLAND. HE JOINED THE MARINE CORPS AFTER BEING RECRUITED IN HIGH SCHOOL BUT SAYS EVERYTHING CHANGED WHILE HE WAS SERVING IN SAUDI ARABIA IN 2021.
>> I HAD LEUKEMIA WHILE I WAS THERE. IT COULD BE STRESS, LACK OF
SLEEP, TOXIC EXPOSURE, DIETARY CHANGES.
>> HE SAYS AFTER STRUGGLING WITH FINDING WORK OUTSIDE OF THE MILITARY AND DEALING WITH DISCRIMINATION, AND NOT HAVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT HE
WANTED IN THE US, HE'S READY FOR A NEW START IN AUSTRIA AND PLANS TO MOVE TO SPAIN. ONE STUDY ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT
3 MILLION AMERICANS LIVE ABROAD.
RANIA AND MICHAEL SAY THEY WILL BE KEEPING THEIR AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP FOR THE FLEXIBILITY OF WORLD TRAVEL WHICH ALSO MEANS THEY WILL STILL PAY US
TAXES. THEY SAY THEY ARE EXCITED TO REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM AMERICAN POLITICS. >> DO YOU THINK YOU WILL VOTE
AT ALL IN NOVEMBER? >> PROBABLY NOT. >> EVEN IF I HAD STAYED I WOULD
NOT HAVE VOTED IN THIS ELECTION EITHER. I THINK WE ARE SEEING THAT NO MATTER WHICH PARTY IS IN POWER
IT'S AN INSANE SYSTEM. I THINK WE HAVE THE ILLUSION OF FREEDOM IN AMERICA. >> SO RANIA HAS BEEN IN TURKEY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND SAYS BOTH HER MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH HAVE IMPROVED. SHE SAYS WHILE SHE IS HOPEFUL THINGS WILL GET BETTER IN THE
US SHE DOESN'T REGRET LEAVING AT ALL. >>> WE WANT TO GET YOU OVER TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT TONIGHT.
RECALLING MORE THAN 200,000 POUNDS OF DELI MEAT OVER LISTERIA CONCERNS. HOW OFFICIALS SAY A SAMPLE OF LIVERWURST TESTED POSITIVE AND
WE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT THIS. THE CDC SAYING MORE THAN TWO DOZEN PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN SICK AND TWO PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN THIS OUTBREAK.
>>> JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE'S LAWYERS SAYING TODAY THAT THE SINGER WAS NOT DRIVING DRUNK WHEN HE GOT STOPPED LAST MONTH. HE'S TRYING TO GET DUI CHARGES
DROPPED AND SAID POLICE DOCUMENTS HAD ERRORS. THEY FILED AN AMENDED DOCUMENT
AND THE JUDGE ORDERED TIMBERLAKE TO APPEAR NEXT WEEK WITH PAPERWORK AND SAID HE CAN
SHOW UP VIRTUALLY. HE'S ON TOUR IN EUROPE RIGHT NOW. >>> A PLAN FILED TODAY CAN MAKE THOUSANDS OF FORMER COLLEGE
ATHLETES ELIGIBLE FOR PAYMENTS FOR A COUPLE OF BUCKS TO MORE THAN $1 MILLION AS PART OF THE
ANTITRUST AGREEMENT THAT WAS AGREED TO.
IT COULD ALSO LEAD TO SCHOOLS DIRECTLY COMPENSATING ATHLETES. A JUDGE STILL HAS TO APPROVE THE DEAL. NUMBER FOUR, OHIO SUPREME COURT
SAYS BONELESS CHICKEN WINGS ACTUALLY CAN HAVE BONES. BASICALLY A MAN FOUND A BONE IN
HIS BONELESS WINGS AND IT GOT STUCK IN HIS THROAT LANDING HIM
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH AN INFECTION. THE COURT RULED QUOTE THAT BONELESS WINGS IS A COOKING STYLE AND THE MAN SHOULD HAVE
WATCHED OUT FOR BONES. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
SWIMMING AROUND CHICAGO'S AQUARIUM, THE 35-YEAR-OLD WHALE
GAVE BIRTH THIS WEEK. IT IS INCREDIBLY CUTE.
>>> FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP COMING UP, HEADLINING A BIT COIN CONFERENCE. WHY HE HAS CHANGED HIS TUNE ON
CRYPTO CURRENCY. IN 19 CENTURY SHIPWRECKS FOUND NEAR SWEDEN CARRYING A
SURPRISING LUXURY ITEM. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
'S HAPPEN
>>> WELCOME BACK. NBC COVERS HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL STORIES EVERY DAY AND BECAUSE YOU CAN READ WATCH
OR LISTEN TO ALL OF THEM, TEAMS AROUND THE WORLD OF DONE IT FOR YOU. HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE
WATCHING IN A SEGMENT WE CALL THE GLOBAL.
THE PHILIPPINES NOW SCRAMBLING TO CLEAR AN OIL SPILL AFTER A SHIP CARING 370,000 GALLONS OF FUEL SINK, KILLING AT LEAST ONE
PERSON. THE TINKER WENT UNDER AFTER FACING CHOPPY SEAS AS A MAJOR
TYPHOON HITS THE REGION. FEARS NOW GROWING THAT THE CARGO SHIP COULD FIRST, SENDING THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF DANGEROUS FUEL INTO THE WATER
AND THE COAST GUARD SAYING THEY ARE PREPARING FOR THE WORST. EGYPT, A MAJOR FIRE BREAKING OUT IN DOWNTOWN CAIRO
DESTROYING SOME OF THE BUILDINGS. IT STARTED IN AN APARTMENT BEING USED AS A SHOE WAREHOUSE AND QUICKLY SPREAD TO OTHER
BUILDINGS. THANKFULLY NOBODY WAS HURT. ONE LOCAL VENDOR SAYING THE FINANCIAL LOSSES ARE
ESTIMATED AT MILLIONS OF EGYPTIAN POUNDS.
>>> OUT OF SWEDEN, LOOK AT THESE STUNNING NEW IMAGES. A PROFESSIONAL DIVER DISCOVERING A SHIPWRECK FROM
THE 19th CENTURY. THE SHIP WAS APPARENTLY FILLED WITH OVER 100 BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE, WINE, PORCELAIN, AND
MINERAL WATER. AND BY THE WAY, BACK IN THE 19 CENTURY, MINERAL WATER WAS
TREATED LIKE MEDICINE AND WAS SO VALUABLE THAT IT WAS ONLY USED BY ROYALS.
>>> TRYING TO COURT CRYPTO AND
CASH, DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO TAKE THE STAGE THERE TOMORROW.
ROBERT KENNEDY JUNIOR SPEAKING IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES
MEANING WE ARE GOING TO SEE CRYPTO AND THE TECH INDUSTRY MORE BROADLY PLAYING AN EVEN LARGER ROLE.
JUST OVER 100 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION AND WE ARE ALSO LEARNING THAT KAMALA HARRIS'S CAMPAIGN IS PUSHING TO BRING BACK TECH DONORS WHO HAVE
INCREASINGLY FAVORED DONALD TRUMP.
McKENZIE IS AT THE BIT COIN CONFERENCE IN NASHVILLE. >> GOOD TO TALK TO YOU. TALK ABOUT THE POLITICS GOING ON IF YOU WILL, AND JUST HOW
FRIENDLY CRYPTO APPEARS TO BE GETTING WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT.
>> THERE ARE REALLY TWO GROUPS HERE THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS FLIRTING WITH. THE FIRST ARE THE KIND OF
PEOPLE WALKING AROUND THIS HALL, THEY ARE YOUNG AND ENTHUSIASTIC BIT COIN SUPPORTERS WHO TEND TO LEAN TOWARD DEREGULATION.
IN ORDER TO CATER TO THEM SOURCES TELL ME THAT FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BEING ADVISED ON STAFFING CHANGES THAT HE COULD ROLL OUT TO MAKE IT MORE CRYPTO FRIENDLY IF HE IS REELECTED.
THEY WILL SEE JUST HOW FAR HE WILL GO TO MAKE ESSENTIAL POLICIES PART OF HIS SPEECH AND
THE OTHER GROUP? SILICON VALLEY AND MILLIONAIRE DONORS.
SO MANY VENTURE CAPITALISTS AND BROKERS HAVE PLEDGED MILLIONS TO THE CAMPAIGN.
OTHERS WILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO GET TRUMP ELECT DID. SEQUOIA CAPITAL
PARTNERS, AND THE LIST GOES ON. >> I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A MAJOR SILICON VALLEY EXECUTIVES
WORKING THE PHONES TRYING TO SWAY SOME MAJOR NAMES IN TECH AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP AND MORE TOWARD THE KAMALA HARRIS CAMP.
WALK US THROUGH THAT. >> NEW REPORTING FROM NBC TODAY REMINDS US THAT THEY ARE
LOOKING TO WIN OVER DEMOCRATIC DONORS NOW THAT SHE'S THE DE
FACTO NOMINEE FOR THE PARTY. MANY PEOPLE WERE WITHHOLDING SUPPORT FROM PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN BUT NOW THAT HE'S OUT OF THE RACE, THEY ARE APPARENTLY
OPEN TO BEING COACHED AND HARRIS HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. SHE'S BEEN RAISING MONEY FOR YEARS INCLUDING THOSE WORKING
AT AMAZON, MICROSOFT AND APPLE. VENTURE CAPITALISTS SAY THAT
THE PIVOT HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW DAYS AND WAS QUOTE DRAMATIC. HIS RUNNING MATE J.D. VANCE WILL HOLD A FUNDRAISER OF
HIS OWN IN PALO ALTO AND THERE DEFINITELY SEEMS TO BE A BATTLE FOR THE MONEY OF THOSE TECH
ELITES. >> APPRECIATE IT.
>>> TO TONIGHT'S ORIGINAL WITH IN-DEPTH REPORTING ON TOPICS THAT WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING.
TONIGHT IT'S THE BATTLE BREWING OVER PREVIOUS COMMENTS BY J.D. VANCE. APPEARING TO CRITICIZE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY, NOW GALVANIZING OVER
RESURFACED COMMENTS CALLING KAMALA HARRIS A QUOTE, CHILDLESS CAT LADY THAT HE HAS
NOW CHALKED UP JUST SARCASM. ALSO SUGGESTIONS THAT PARENTS
SHOULD GET MORE VOTES THEN CHILDLESS PEOPLE.
HE CALLED THOSE COMMENTS QUOTE, A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT. THE CONTROVERSY SHOWS HOW
FAVORS OF THE FAMILY HAVE BECOME CENTRAL TO CULTURE WARS BUT ALSO HIGHLIGHTING ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF VOTERS. CHILDCARE, FAMILY LEAVE,
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND ONE GROUP TRYING TO BRIDGE THE DIVIDE. >>> A JAW-DROPPING MOMENT IN A
DEBATE WITH MANY. >> WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO MAKE CHILDCARE MORE AFFORDABLE. >> THERE WAS A REAL MOVEMENT TO
HAVE A QUESTION IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE AROUND CHILDCARE AND NEITHER CANDIDATE ANSWERED.
THAT WAS HURTFUL. >> NO BUDDY.
>> HE FINALLY GOT IN A FEW WORDS ON THE TOPIC. >> WE SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY
INCREASE THE CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT. >> BUT IT DID NOT IMPRESS THE
COFOUNDER OF CHAMBER OF MOTHERS. >> THERE ARE A LOT OF REPRESENTATIVES AND CONGRESSPEOPLE WHO ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES.
WE WANT TO GIVE THE POWER BACK TO MOTHERS. >> THEY ARE WORKING TO MAKE
ISSUES AFFECTING MOTHERS FRONT AND CENTER IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION. >> ARE THE EVEN TALKING ABOUT
PAID LEAVE? ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT MATERNAL HEALTH? ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THE COST OF CHILDCARE? >> THROUGH VOTER REGISTRATION
DRIVES AND A NONPARTISAN MESSAGE, CHAMBER OF MOTHERS HOPES TO REACH MILLIONS OF
MOTHERS AND ENGAGE THEM AS A BONA FIDE VOTING BLOCK. >> IN THE PANDEMIC, MOTHERS PUT HIS COUNTRY ON THEIR BACK AND MADE IT SO THAT WE DID NOT
INCUR ECONOMIC COLLAPSE. THAT IS POWER. >> VOTING LIKE A MOTHER OR ON
ANY ISSUE SURROUNDING FAMILY OFTEN BECOMES POLITICAL IN
TODAY'S HEATED CULTURE WARS. >> I THINK IT IS YOU, THE WOMEN, WHO HAVE THE MOST DIABOLICAL LIES TOLD TO YOU. >> REMEMBER THIS CONTROVERSY?
>> HE DISRESPECTED HIS WIFE AND STAY AT HOME MOTHERS EVERYWHERE. >> HE TOOK TO TWITTER FOR
SAYING THEY LIKE BEING MOTHERS. >> THESE COMMENTS RESURFACING AFTER HE WAS NAMED TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE. >> WE ARE EFFECTIVELY RUN VIA
DEMOCRATS AND CORPORATE OLIGARCHS BY A BUNCH OF CHILDLESS CAT LADIES. >> A RECENT POLL SHOWS A MAJOR
GAP IN THE WAYS THAT VOTERS VIEW GOVERNMENT POLICY AROUND THE FAMILY WITH 59% OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS SAYING THAT SOCIETY
IS BETTER OFF MAKING MARRIAGE AND HAVING CHILDREN A PRIORITY VERSUS ONLY 19% OF BIDEN
SUPPORTERS. THE CHAMBER OF MOTHERS SAYS THAT IS ALL JUST NOISE. >> FORMULA FEEDING, BREAST
FEEDING, DO YOU WORK OUTSIDE OF THE HOME? ARE YOU A FULL-TIME MOTHER?
WE SAY THAT ALL OF THAT IS--. >> THERE IS NO FEDERALLY
PROTECTED PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND OVER HALF OF AMERICANS LIVE IN A CHILDCARE DESERT, MEANING
THERE ARE FEW OPTIONS AND OFTEN
UNAFFORDABLE. >> THAT IS JUST NOT HOW WE WANT TO RUN OUR COUNTRY. >> THIS GROUP OF MOTHERS CAME TOGETHER AFTER PAID FAMILY LEAVE WAS CUT FOR PRESIDENT
BIDEN TO BUILD BACK AT HER LEGISLATION IN 2021 AND THREE YEARS LATER REMAINING COMMITTED NOT ONLY TO THE ISSUES BUT TO
THE POWER OF BEING A MOTHER. >> WE ARE UNITED IN THAT VISION, WE ACTIVATE MOMS TO CREATE CHANGE AROUND THAT, AND
WE ARE HERE TO STAY. >> THE CHAMBER OF MOTHERS TELLS ME THEY ARE EXCITED TO SEE KAMALA HARRIS PLATFORM PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND BETTER
MATERNAL HEALTH CARE. THEY ARE ALSO SAYING THAT THEY ARE HOPING FOR UNITY, WHERE
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAN AGREE SPECIFICALLY ON THESE
ISSUES. >>> COMING UP, ALL EYES ARE ON VENEZUELA AND PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS THIS WEEKEND. WHY THE WORLD IS HOLDING ITS BREATH TO SEE IF THEY ARE FREE
AND FAIR
