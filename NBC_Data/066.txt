THERE IS A PRETTY COMPRESSED
TIMELINE.
THOSE WHO ARE SENT TO RALLY FOR
HARRIS OUTSIDE OF PHILADELPHIA.
BACK TO YOU.
>> STAYING IN POLITICS, THE
CAMPAIGNS ARE SPENDING LOTS OF
TIME IN BATTLEGROUND STATES.
THERE ARE BATTLEGROUND COUNTIES
THAT CAN BRING THE WHOLE
OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION.
THE POLLS WERE SHOWING THAT
PRESIDENT BIDEN AND FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE NECK AND
NECK.
EXPLAINING HOW THOSE POLLS
COULD CHANGE.
>> MORE THAN 3100 COUNTIES WITH
A FINAL 100 DAYS UNTIL ELECTION
DAY.
SEVEN DECIDER COUNTIES.
EACH ONE TELLS AN IMPORTANT
STORY DEMOGRAPHICALLY ABOUT
WHERE THE NATIONAL RACE MAY BE
GOING.
WITH KAMALA HARRIS SAID TO
REPLACE JOE BIDEN.
TWO COUNTIES THAT ARE AMONG
THIS GROUP OF DECIDER COUNTIES.
LET'S START IN THE STATE OF
GEORGIA.
THIS IS JUST OUTSIDE OF ATLANTA
IN THE GROWING METRO AREA.
GEORGIA, A REPUBLICAN STATE
UNTIL 2020.
AFTER GETTING IT FROM THE
NARROWEST OF MARGINS.
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN PULLING

BIDEN OVER TRUMP.
THEY ARE HOPING TO EXPAND THIS
MARGIN EVEN FURTHER.
THE BIG PICTURE HOPE FOR
DEMOCRATS YEAR, THAT THE
POLLING IN GEORGIA WHICH LOOKS
PARTICULARLY SHADY FOR THEM.
HOPEFULLY THIS WILL CHANGE A STATE LIKE GEORGIA.
STATE LIKE GEORGIA.
NOW LOOK AT PENNSYLVANIA.
PENNSYLVANIA IS EXTREMELY CRUCIAL.
CRUCIAL.
JUST BECAUSE OF THE SIZE.
THIS POTENTIALLY WILL SHUT OFF
FOR THESE CANDIDATES.
ONE OF TWO COUNTIES IN THE
ENTIRE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA
THAT FLIPS IN 2016.
BIDEN IN 2020.
PENNSYLVANIA ITSELF IS A STATE
FLIPPED IN 2016 TO BIDEN IN
2020.
ONE OF THE KEYS SWING COUNTIES
OF THESE SWINGS STAY.
THIS HAS A HUGE BLUE-COLLAR
POPULATION.
AN AREA OF GROWTH FOR
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS.
GETTING WORSE AND WORSE HERE
WITH THIS DEMOGRAPHIC.
A LARGE REPRESENTATION OF THAT GROUP OF VOTERS AND THE

QUESTION HERE FOR KAMALA
HARRIS, CAN SHE DOING IN A
