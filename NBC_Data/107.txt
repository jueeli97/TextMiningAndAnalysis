Simone Biles and Team USA win gold
♪ ♪
>>> GOOD EVENING. WE ARE LIVE TONIGHT AGAIN FROM PARIS ON A MONUMENTAL DAY FOR TEAM USA. SIMONE BILES AND THE U.S.
GYMNASTICS TEAM DELIVERING ON THEIR PROMISE OF REDEMPTION TOUR. THE TEAM RECLAIMING THEIR PLACE ON TOP CLENCHING GOLD ONCE
AGAIN. A NEARLY FLAWLESS PERFORMANCE ON ALL FOUR GYMNASTIC EVENTS. SUNI LEE LEAVING THE CROWD STUNNED DELIVERING ON THE UNEVEN BARS.
JORDAN CHILES CRUSHING HER FLOOR ROUTINE EXUDING CONFIDENCE AFTER A FALL ON THE
BEAM AND JADE CAREY RECOVERING FROM BEING SICK, LANDING HER ROUTINE ON VAULT. BUT IT WAS SIMONE BILES CLOSING
OUT THE NIGHT WITH A HIGH FLYING FLOOR ROUTINE FEATURING SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT TUMBLING AND GYMNASTICS. THEY DON'T CALL IT A COMEBACK
FOR NOTHING. BILES PROVING TO BE UNSTOPPABLE ON THE VAULT, POWERING THROUGH THE SAME EVENT THAT LED HER TO DROP OUT OF THE TOKYO EVENT THREE YEARS AGO, YOU MAY
REMEMBER. THE GYMNASTICS GREAT MADE HER DEBUT IN 2016 IN RIO.
EIGHT YEARS LATER AND SHE IS CLAIMING GOLD ONCE AGAIN. THAT METAL LANDING HER IN THE
RECORD BOOKS. SIMONE BILES PASSING SHANNON MILLER FOR THE MOST DECORATED
OLYMPIC GYMNAST. BILES MAKING HISTORY WITH EIGHT METALS. IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS WE WILL SPEAK TO MILLER WHO HELPED LEAD THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN TO GOLD
BACK IN 1996 BUT IT WASN'T JUST GYMNASTICS PUTTING THE U.S. ON THE PODIUM. THERE WERE A NUMBER THAT'S
NUMBER OF NOTABLE WINS INCLUDING IN THE POOL WHERE BOBBY FINK ADDED A SILVER TO HIS IMPRESSIVE METAL COLLECTION. REAGAN SMITH EARNING HER FIRST OLYMPIC MEDAL AND TEAM USA
MEN'S SWIMMING COMING IN SECOND IN THE RELAY. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A CENTURY THE U.S. TAKING HOME A METAL FOR RUGBY. THE U.S. TEAM CLAIMING THE BRONZE AFTER DRAMATIC PLAY, A
BREAKAWAY SCORE AT THE END OF THE MATCH. TAKING A LOOK AT THE METAL BOARD RIGHT NOW THE U.S. IN THE LEAD FOR ANOTHER DOOR -- DAY WITH 26 METALS INCLUDING FOUR
GOLD. FRANCE AND CHINA TRAILING BEHIND BUT IT WASN'T ALL CELEBRATORY.
COCO GAUFF BREAKING DOWN IN TEARS AS HER QUEST FOR A GOLD- MEDAL WAS CUT SHORT. UPSET AFTER A CALL FROM AN
UMPIRE. THE MATCH ENDED IN THE LOSS
FROM THE EMPIRE. >>> STORMS ARE CAUSING BACTERIA LEVELS IN THE ICONIC RIVER SEND TONIGHT. OFFICIALS SAY THEY COULD
FURTHER POSTPONE THE EVENT OR REMOVE THE SWIMMING PORTION. WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO ON THIS HISTORIC EVENING IN THE CITY OF LIGHT. STEPHANIE GOSK JOINS TOP STORY
RIGHT NOW. YOU WERE INSIDE THAT ARENA, I WAS INSIDE THAT ARENA. >> IT WAS ELECTRIC.
>> TEAM USA WAS PLAYING A DIFFERENT GAME TONIGHT. >> THEY ABSOLUTELY WERE. I WAS IN TOKYO. I WATCH THEM STRUGGLE IN AN EMPTY ARENA WITH NO SUPPORT. THEY CAME IN A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT TEAM, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. AND THEY PERFORMED WITH SUCH STABILITY AND STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE, THEY JUST BROUGHT
THE HOUSE DOWN. I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO THEM RIGHT AFTER THEY GOT OFF THE PODIUM. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY.
>> Reporter: YOU GUYS DUG DEEP TO GET THE SILVER IN TOKYO. HOW DOES THIS MOMENT COMPARE?
>> OH MY GOSH, THIS ONE IS SO DIFFERENT. WE HAD SO MUCH MORE FUN THIS TIME, CLEARLY AND, YEAH, WE
DID. IT WAS SO DIFFERENT. IT'S NICE TO LOOK UP AND SEE HER FAMILY IN THE STANDS. I'M SO PROUD OF EVERYONE AND WE DID OUR THING TODAY.
>> Reporter: YOU GUYS HAD AN AUDIENCE BUT DID YOU HEAR HOW MUCH LOUDER THEY WERE CHEERING FOR YOU? >> WE WERE NERVOUS WE WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO HEAR OUR
FLOOR MUSIC AND ALL OF THAT BUT WE EMBRACE THE MOMENT AND HAD FUN WITH IT. >> THEY ARE CLEARLY EXCITED THERE BUT THEY ARE ALSO
RELIEVED. THINK ABOUT THE PRESSURE BUILDING UP TO THIS MOMENT. >> AND THEY ARE NOT LYING. IT WAS LOUD IN THERE ESPECIALLY FOR SIMONE. ANYTIME SHE WALKED OUT THE
PLACE WOULD GO CRAZY AND YOU THINK ABOUT THAT PRESSURE. IT WAS ALL ABOUT SIMONE. WOULD SHE DELIVER AND SHE DID
TONIGHT.
>> ABSOLUTELY SHE DID AND SINCE SHE CAME BACK SHE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY UNTOUCHABLE AND WHEN SHE COMPLETES ALL OF HER ROUTINES AND COMPLETES THEM WITHOUT ANY MISTAKES, NO ONE
CAN COME EVEN CLOSE TO HER SO SHE'S OFTEN REALLY JUST IN COMPETITION FOR HERSELF BUT IN THAT MOMENT SHE IS ALSO A BEACON FOR THE TEAM. SHE STARTS SHOWING THAT
CONFIDENCE AND IT JUST KIND OF SPREADS TO EVERYONE AND YOU REALLY SAW THAT TONIGHT. >> YOU MENTIONED TOKYO. WE BOTH SAW SUNI LEE STEP UP IN
TOKYO. I LOVE TO WATCH HER PERFORM ON THE TEAM AS WELL BECAUSE SIMONE IS OBVIOUSLY THE BEST EVER. BUT SUNI LEE IS ALMOST LIKE THE
GLUE. YOU KNOW YOU CAN RELY ON HER.
>> IN THE WARM-UPS FOR THE UNEVEN BARS, SUNI LEE MR. BARR AND SHE FELL AND I THOUGHT, OH MY GOD.
AND SHE JUMPED RIGHT BACK UP AND SHE GOT UP THERE AND SHE NAILED THAT PERFORMANCE AND YOU CAN TELL SHE FINISHED, SHE
STUCK THE LANDING AND SHE HUGGED HER COACH AND IT WAS SO FANTASTIC TO WATCH HER DO THAT. >> IF YOU WATCHED TONIGHT YOU
ALSO NOTICED TEAM BRAZIL AND GREAT GYMNASTS ON TEAM BRAZIL.
WHAT TYPE OF COMPETITION ARE THEY GOING TO GIVE TEAM USA IN
THE INDIVIDUALS?
>> I'VE HAD PEOPLE IN THE GYMNASTICS WORLD SAY THIS. IT'S REALLY A COMPETITION FOR SILVER AND BRONZE IF SIMONE CAN STAY ON THE TRACK THAT SHE HAS BEEN ON AND THERE IS NO
INDICATION THAT SHE HAS BEEN WAVERING AT ALL. SHE LOOKS SO STRONG, STEADY AND CONFIDENT. >> STEPHANIE GOSK, WE
APPRECIATE IT. FOR MORE ON THIS HISTORIC MOMENT FOR TEAM USA I WANT TO BRING IN SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN THIS POSITION HERSELF. AMERICAN GYMNAST SHANNON MILLER. SHE HELPED LEAD THE 1996
OLYMPIC TEAM KNOWN AS THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN TO THE FIRST EVER GOLD IN ATLANTA.
FOR DECADES SHE WAS THE MOST
DECORATED GYMNAST WITH SEVEN METALS. THE TITLE SHE SHARED WITH SIMONE BILES UNTIL TEAM USA'S GOLD EARLIER TONIGHT. SHANNON MILLER JOINS TOP STORY TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
IT HAS TO BE A SPECIAL NIGHT
FOR YOU. I KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING THE COVERAGE, OBVIOUSLY ROOTING FOR TEAM USA. RECORDS ARE MEANT TO BE BROKEN, HOW ARE YOU FEELING? >> I'M SO HAPPY AND MY HEART IS
SO FULL BECAUSE I KNOW AS AN ATHLETE WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN A GOLD MEDAL AND THESE LADIES HAVE BEEN THROUGH IT ALL ON THE ROAD TO GET HERE AND I REALLY
DO FEEL LIKE EIGHT METALS NOW WHICH IS AMAZING AND SHE HAS FOUR MORE CHANCES OF MEDDLING. SHE COULD DO AMAZING AND EVEN
BETTER THAN THE METALS, SHE IS INSPIRING THE NEXT GENERATION OF ATHLETES TO GO FARTHER THAN THEY EVER IMAGINED.
>> YOUR TEAM WAS SO SPECIAL.
PEOPLE NEVER FORGET THOSE ICONIC MOMENTS OF THAT TEAM. WHEN YOU WATCH TEAM USA NOW, THEY WON THE GOAL, TALK TO ME
ABOUT THE TEAM BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE THEY WERE DOMINATING . >> ABSOLUTELY. ALMOST SIX POINTS. IT WAS A LITTLE RIDICULOUS BUT THEIR DIFFICULTY LEVEL IS SO HIGH. WHEN YOU WATCH SIMONE DO A
TRIPLE TWISTING DOUBLE BACK, MY MIND EXPLODES THINKING OF THE AIR AWARENESS INVOLVED IN THAT SO IT REALLY IS SOMETHING
SPECIAL AND I LOVE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR LEOTARDS WERE THROWBACK TO THE 1996 TEAM AND OUR 1996 LEOTARDS WERE THROWBACK TO THE 1984
TEAM. IT'S JUST HISTORY. >> GYMNASTICS HAS CHANGED SO
MUCH. HOW MUCH HAS IT CHANGED AS FAR AS THE ATHLETICISM? IS IT THE
POWER? IS IT THE RISK? >> EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED. SCORING, EQUIPMENT, BUT WHAT
HASN'T CHANGED IS ATHLETES CONTINUE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE. CAN I ADD ANOTHER FLIP? AND I ADD ANOTHER TWIST?
CAN I DO SOMETHING NO ONE HAS EVER DONE BEFORE LIKE SIMONE
HAS DONE AND THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT GYMNASTICS. IT'S ALWAYS GETTING BIGGER AND BETTER.
>> SIMONE IS INCREDIBLE. I HAPPEN TO BE IN TOKYO TO WATCH SUNI LEE WIN THE GOLD AND WHEN SHE STEPPED UP, SHE
STEPPED UP TO HEAR.
DOES TEAM USA ALSO WIN THE GOLD WITHOUT SUNI LEE? SHE STUCK EVERYTHING SHE WAS THERE FOR.
>> YES AND SHE DOES SUCH AN AMAZING JOB AND SHE HAS AN AMAZING STORY WITH HER HEALTH CHALLENGES COMING INTO THIS
EVENT. HER TOKYO OLYMPICS WAS AMAZING BUT SHE FOLLOWED IT UP WITH A GREAT COLLEGIATE CAREER AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT A TEAM, IT REALLY DOES TAKE EVERYONE.
IT TAKES EVERYONE ON THE TEAM TO REALLY MAKE IT SPECIAL AND THAT IS WHAT WE FOUND, THE MAG
SEVEN AND THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND HERE TONIGHT.
>> TALK TO ME ABOUT THE PRESSURE. YOU'RE A YOUNG WOMAN, YOU WORK
YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS MOMENT
AT THE OLYMPICS. THE ENTIRE WORLD IS WATCHING, THEY ARE WATCHING EVERY STEP YOU MAKE, YOU CAN'T MAKE ONE MISTAKE. WHAT IS THAT LIKE? >> I THINK IT'S HARDER TODAY
THAN IT WAS IN MY ERA. WE DIDN'T HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA. WE DIDN'T KNOW EVERYONE WAS WATCHING.
BUT HERE THEY DO. THEY KNOW EVERYONE IS WATCHING. BUT THEY'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. FOUR OF THE FIVE TEAMMATES HAD ALREADY BEEN TO THE OLYMPICS SO THEY HAD THAT GOING IN, THEY
WERE VETERANS AND THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO AND IF THERE WAS A MISSTEP THEY KNEW HOW TO GET BACK ON TRACK.
>> TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE OLYMPICS IN THE DAYS AHEAD.
WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS. HOW DO YOU THINK SIMONE IS GOING TO DO? SUNI EVERYONE ELSE . >> A LOT OF BIG PERFORMANCES COMING UP TOMORROW. WE'VE GOT THE WOMEN'S ALL-
AROUND WHICH SIMONE HAS EVERY CHANCE TO WIN GOLD BUT SO DOES SUNI LEE SO, YOU'VE GOT TWO
ALL-AROUND OLYMPIC CHAMPIONS GOING HEAD TO HEAD IN THIS COMPETITION. THAT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE AND THEN YOU HAVE ALL OF THE EVENT FINALS. THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR
U.S. women win first ever Rugby sevens medal
ATHLETES TO STACK UP AT MEDAL COUNT. >> SHANNON MILLER, SUCH A PLEASURE. ON BEHALF OF EVERYONE, HERE AT
HOME, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
CONTRIBUTIONS. >> FOR MORE ON THE OLYMPIC EVENTS YOU MIGHT'VE MISSED, CATHERINE TAPPAN JOINS ME NOW. LET'S START WITH WOMEN'S RUGBY.
THAT FANTASTIC BRONZE MEDAL FINISH. THE FIRST U.S. RUGBY MEDAL IN RUGBY SEVENS, THE WOMEN
BESTING AUSTRALIA AND PULLING OUT OFF IN SPECTACULAR FASHION. TELL ME ABOUT THAT MATCH. >> IT'S SO EXCITING. WE'VE BEEN WATCHING RUGBY SEVENS NOW FOR SEVEN DAYS. WE'VE BEEN HERE IN STUDIO IN
SANFORD NETIQUETTE, THE RUGBY COMPETITION GOT UNDERWAY LAST WEDNESDAY BEFORE THE OPENING CEREMONY SO WE'VE BEEN WATCHING THE MEN, WATCHING THE WOMEN, BUT THIS TEAM WAS REALLY SPECIAL, THEY HAD A CERTAIN
DRIVE ABOUT THEM, AND EVEN WHEN THEY WERE GOING FOR THAT BRONZE
MEDAL, THEY NEVER FAILED TO PERFORMANCE TILL THE END OF THE GAME. THEY WERE MIRACULOUS, THEY WENT WHITE TO THE FINISH LINE.
HUGE FOR WOMEN'S RUGBY WHICH IS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE
. IT'S GOING TO SET THE BAR HIGHER, ALL THE PLAYERS THAT ARE BECOME -- ON THIS USA
WOMEN'S ROSTER BUT ALSO TO THOSE THAT WANT TO BECOME U.S.
WOMEN'S OLYMPIANS IN RUGBY. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH AND ALSO ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE WOMEN'S DOMINANCE IN SPORTS RIGHT NOW AND THE ATTENTION ON
THEM AND THEIR ABILITY TO SUCCEED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. ON THE BIGGEST STAGE WITH SO MUCH PRESSURE AS WELL.
>> TWO WINS A BRONZE MEDAL, I THINK -- THE NEXT BIG
COMPETITION, SWIMMING COMING UP BIG, TAKING HOME A SILVER IN
THE MEN'S 800 METER FREESTYLE AND SILVER IN THE MEN'S FOUR BY
200 METER FREESTYLE. HOW DID THEY PULL ALL THIS OFF IN THE POOL AND HOW HIS TEAM USA LOOKING OVERALL IN THE POOL?
>> OVERALL LOOKING GREAT. WE EXPECTED THIS FROM TEAM USA IN SWIMMING AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET BETTER FOR THEM AS WE SEE THE EVENTS
EVOLVE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS BUT, I THINK THAT THEY ARE
VERY COMFORTABLE, CONFIDENT, THEY'VE GOT A HUGE ARRIVAL IN AUSTRALIA, WE KNOW THAT STORY BUT I THINK THAT'S ONLY FUELING THEIR DESIRE FOR THIS
COMPETITION AND AS WE DO WE SEE THEM PERFORM ON THE BIGGEST STAGE. I'M A JERSEY GIRL, I LIKE TO SEE THE JERSEY GUYS ON THE STAGE FOR SWIMMING COMING FROM
OUR HOME STATE AND IT'S GREAT BECAUSE YOU HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THESE ATHLETES NOW. YOU HEAR THEIR STORY ALL ABOUT THEM UP-AND-COMING IN THE SUCCESS THEY HAVE IN HIGH
SCHOOL THROUGH COLLEGE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY BECOME OLYMPIANS AND THEY ARE REPRESENTING THE USA. SO THEY ARE LIVING UP TO THE HYPE AND CERTAINLY WE HAVE SEEN
TREMENDOUS PERFORMANCES IN THE POOL SO FAR AND I THINK IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET BETTER AS THE INDIVIDUAL EVENTS MOVE ON.
>> LET'S TRANSITION TO SOCCER AND GET OUR VIEWERS UP TO SPEED
ON TEAM USA MEN'S SOCCER. THIS IS A TEAM WE ARE WATCHING . >> HOW EXCITING IS THAT?
BACK IN THE OLYMPICS THE FIRST
TIME IN 16 YEARS. QUARTERFINALS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 24 YEARS. THIS IS HUGE FOR U.S. MEN'S NATIONAL TEAM SOCCER. WE HAD TIM HOWARD ON SATURDAY, HALL OF FAMER, WE KNOW H FROM
HIS GOALTENDING DAYS, GOALKEEPER DAYS AND HE'S ONE OF OUR ANALYSTS HERE ON NBC AND HE PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR US
HIM OF THIS TEAM IS SOMETHING SPECIAL RIGHT NOW. THEY ASSEMBLED A GREAT GROUP OF TALENTED YOUNG MEN. THE VETERANS ON THE TEAM WERE HAND SELECTED AND CHOSEN FOR
VERY SPECIFIC REASONS AND WE ARE SEEING THAT LEADERSHIP EVOLVE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF GAMES, I MEAN, THEY ARE --
THEIR VICTORY OVER NEW ZEALAND THE OTHER DAY FOLLOWED BY THE VICTORY TODAY TO PUT THEM IN THE QUARTERFINALS WAS HUGE AND THEY ARE WRITING THIS MOMENTUM RIGHT NOW AND THESE ARE A LOT
OF THE FACES WE ARE GOING TO SEE TWO YEARS FROM NOW ON THE WORLD CUP STAGE AND IT'S GREAT THAT WERE GETTING RECOGNITION NOW. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT MATCH
AGAINST MOROCCO IN THE QUARTERFINALS. THIS IS A MOROCCO TEAM THAT HAS EVERYONE STUNNED RIGHT NOW. WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO STARTING WITH THEIR MATCH AGAINST ARGENTINA IN THE FIRST
GAME OF THE OLYMPICS AND OF
COURSE THE CONTROVERSY THAT ENSUED FROM THAT WITH THE FINAL WHISTLE AND COMING BACK TWO HOURS LATER AND HAVING TO PLAY THE GAME AND THE REST OF THE GAME.
THERE'S A LOT OF STORY LINES AROUND THIS MOROCCO TEAM AND WE WILL BE BUILDING UP TO THAT MATCH AGAINST THE USA ON FRIDAY BUT I LIKE THE USA'S CHANCES, I
LIKE THE WAY THEY ARE PLANNING RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE PLAYING AS A TEAM, THEY ARE ALL BECOMING SUPERSTAR NAMES THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING FOR THE
NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND IT'S BEEN REALLY FUN TO WATCH BECAUSE I THINK THE U.S. MEN'S
SOCCER PROGRAM IN GENERAL HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME. >> HERE IN PARIS AND EUROPE OBVIOUSLY FANS ARE LOVING IT. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU DEALERS
CHOICE ON THIS LAST QUESTION. SO MUCH EXCITING THINGS HAPPENING TOMORROW. YOU'VE GOT MEN'S BASKETBALL, WOMEN'S SOCCER, YOU'VE GOT KATIE LEDECKY BACK IN THE POOL. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING AND WHAT
YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN? >> I WISH I COULD PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I WOULD PROBABLY BE MAKING A LOT MORE MONEY BUT I WILL TELL
YOU I CAN PREDICT WE ARE GOING TO SEE SOME OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCES ON THE COURT. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE MEN'S BASKETBALL GAME. IT'S BEEN GREAT TO SEE THEM ON
THE COURT AND THIS IS A TEAM THAT CHALLENGE THEM JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO BEFORE THE OLYMPICS BEGAN SO IT WILL BE FUN TO SEE THAT TEST. WOMEN'S SOCCER HAS BEEN DRAWING
HUGE NUMBERS. EVERYONE IS GLUED IN, LEARNING THE NEW FACES, MI HAYES LEARNING THE GROUP.
PLAYERS THAT ARE LONG GONE, AND FRESH FACES WE'VE GOT NOW WE
ARE CHEERING FOR. OF COURSE, YES, KATIE LEDECKY,
HOW COULD YOU NOT WANT TO WATCH HER? I DO BELIEVE SHE WILL TAKE HOME THE GOLD MEDAL TOMORROW BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ALL THE
MATCHES. I'VE BEEN BROADCASTING ALL THE COVERAGE ON USA NETWORK AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF UNIQUE EVENTS ARE TABLE TENNIS, CANOE SLALOM, SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO WATCH SPORTS THAT WE DON'T
USUALLY GET TO WATCH ON A DAILY BASIS AND WE ARE THE -- ALL LEARNING AND GROWING FROM THIS
EXPERIENCE AND CHEERING ON ATHLETES THAT ARE COMPETING THEIR DARNDEST IN PARIS. IT'S GREAT TO SEE.
Triathlon postponed due to Seine river contamination
>> SUCH A SPECIAL TIME. THANK YOU FOR BEING ON TOP STORY TONIGHT. >> YEP. >>> IT HASN'T ALL BEEN SMOOTH SAILING IN PARIS FOR OLYMPIC GAMES. ORGANIZERS POSTPONING THE MEN'S
TRIATHLON RACING THE SEINE RIVER REMAINS UNSAFE FOR
SWIMMING. NOW MOVED TO WEDNESDAY AND SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE AFTER THE END OF THE WOMEN'S
TRIATHLON. FOR MORE ON THE SIN SAFETY, I'M
JOINED BY THE REPORTER MOST EXPERIENCED WITH THE RIVER AT LEAST IN THIS OLYMPIC GAMES. YOU'VE JUMPED INTO THE SEINE, YOU DRINK WATER FROM THE SEINE.
UPSTREAM WORDS A LITTLE CLEANER. WHAT IS HAPPENING? WILL THE TRIATHLON TAKE PLACE? >> THERE'S TENSION FOR THE CITY
OF PARIS BECAUSE THEY'VE SPENT $1.5 BILLION TRYING TO CLEAN UP THE SEINE AND NOW THEY'VE HAD TO POSTPONE THE TRIATHLON.
THE COMPETITION ITSELF EVEN WITHOUT THE COMPETITION EVEN
STARTING YET BECAUSE THEY WILL TEST THE WATER OVERNIGHT AND MAKE A DECISION IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING.
IT'S INTERESTING. YOU TALK TO TRIATHLONS AND WHAT THEY SAY IS THAT THIS COMPETITION HAS TO HAPPEN IN
OPEN WATER. PART OF IT IS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO NAVIGATE THE TIDE AREA THE CURRENTS. SO IT'S PART OF IT AND
SOMETIMES THE DELAYS ARE PART OF IT TOO. YOU NEED TO HAVE THE MENTAL STRENGTH TO BE READY WHEN THE RIVER IS READY BUT WILL IT BE READY TOMORROW?
THERE ARE STORMS OVER PARIS TONIGHT. MORE RAIN POTENTIALLY.
IT'S BEEN HOT. WILL THE BACTERIA REDUCE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GET THE COMPETITION TO HAPPEN TOMORROW BEFORE IT GOES UP AGAIN? >> THE RAIN COMES, THE RUNOFF
FROM THIS BIG CITY GOES RIGHT INTO THE RIVER AND THEN WHAT IS THE FEAR?
THAT THEY DRINK THE WATER, IT GETS INTO AN OPEN WOUND AND IT
COULD BE MUCH WORSE.
>> ANY OF THOSE THINGS AND THEY SAY THEIR MAIN PRIORITY IS TO PROTECT THE ATHLETES AND THEY CAN DECIDE IN THE END TO NOT HAVE THE SWIMMING. >> THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT.
ELIMINATING SWIM FROM THE TRIATHLON. >> IT'S THE FINAL POSSIBLE SOLUTION AND OUTCOME BUT FIRST THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF DAYS WHERE THEY CAN DO THIS SO MY SUSPICION IS THAT THEY WILL
MANAGE TO FIND THE DAY AND WINDOW WHEN IT CAN HAPPEN BUT IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE THAT THEY HAVE A TRIATHLON WITHOUT THE
SWIMMING AND THE CHALLENGE FOR THE ATHLETES OF COURSE IS THEY PREPARED FOR THAT LEG, SOME OF THEM WILL BE STRONGER IN THAT LEG. IT'S ALL PART OF THE

THOSE FEARS MANIFESTING INTO A DARK REALITY FOR LEBANESE PEOPLE WHO WORRY THIS CONFLICT COULD STILL LOOK MUCH WORSE.
EVEN NOW THERE IS SOME CONFUSION OVER WHETHER OR NOT FOUAD SHUKR IS EVEN DEAD.
TWO SECURITY SOURCES IN LEBANON SAYING HE SURVIVE THIS ATTACK BUT THE IDF DID SAY THAT THEY KILLED HIM REGARDLESS. A LOT OF ANXIETY HERE IN LEBANON TURNING TO WHETHER OR

LONG PREPARATION TO GET HERE AND WE ARE JUST REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO SEE HER ON THE BIG STAGE AND FINALLY GET TO SEE HER PERFORM AGAINST THE
BEST IN THE WORLD.
>> HOW IS JENNY DOING? I KNOW IT'S SO MUCH PRESSURE. HOW IS HER HEADSPACE RIGHT NOW? >> SHE SEEMS REALLY GOOD.

NOT A LOT OF MONEY ESPECIALLY IN A SPORT LIKE YOURS. FAMILIES STRUGGLE.
YOU GUYS STRUGGLED TO KEEP YOUR GYM OPEN. EXPLAIN TO YOUR VIEWERS HOW HARD IT IS TO EVEN GET TO THIS POINT. >> IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME, A
LOT OF HOURS. A LOT OF WORK ON OUR END AND ON THE ATHLETES AND, A LOT OF SELF-
DISCIPLINE. IT COMES FROM BOTH SIDES. >> YOU EVEN HAVE THESE
OLYMPIANS WHO ARE TRAINING SELLING WATER BOTTLES, FUNDRAISING ONLINE ON GOFUNDME.

THEM HELP US. WE'VE BEEN OVERWHELMED WITH THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT WE GOT. IT'S BEEN AMAZING. >> WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO WIN IN
BOXING IN THE OLYMPICS? >> SHE NEEDS TO STAY FOCUSED AND KEEP DOING WHAT SHE'S DOING AND STAY HUNGRY AND STAY
POSITIVE AND FOR AS LONG AS SHE DOES EVERYTHING THAT SHE'S BEEN DOING BACK AT CAMP, SHE WILL BE
READY FOR WHAT'S COMING.
>> WHO ARE SOME OF THE BOXERS FROM THE BIG COUNTRIES YOU GUYS ARE WATCHING THAT COULD GIVE JENNY A TOUGH TIME?

HERE WE ARE. IT'S JUST AMAZING TO SEE JENNY GOING UP AGAINST THIS GIRL WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET WITH.
>> MICHELLE IN OUR STORY THAT WE DID ON JENNY THERE WAS A LOT OF EMOTION BETWEEN HER AND HER MOTHER, RIGHT? IT'S TOUGH TO BE A FEMALE BOXER.
IT'S TOUGH TO BE A FEMALE BOXER IN A HISPANIC ENVIRONMENT.
SHE GOT BULLIED. SHE HAD TO TAKE A LOT OF
CHANCES. IT'S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY FOR JENNY. >> SHE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF TRAUMA, A LOT OF UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCES BUT IT HAS MADE HER STRONGER AND THAT IS WHAT HAS
MADE HER THE FEMALE POWERHOUSE THAT SHE IS NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY BUT MENTALLY 100% AREA
