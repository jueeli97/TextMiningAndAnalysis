WEEKDAYS AT 7:00.
>>> IF IT'S FRIDAY, OFF TO THE RACES AND GOING FOR GOLD. NEW POLLING SHOWS VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS NARROWING THE GAP WITH KEY VOTER GROUPS IN
THE RACE AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. SHE PICKS UP A KEY ENDORSEMENT WITH JUST OVER 100 DAYS UNTIL ELECTION DAY. >>> PLUS, REGIMEN NETANYAHU

Obama backs Harris, capping week of unity and enthusiasm for Democrats
>> WELCOME TO MEET THE PRESS NOW. I AM GARRETT HEYD IN WASHINGTON. IN A MARATHON WEEK IN A SPRINT TO ELECTION DAY, IT LOOKS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN IT DID A WEEK AGO. PRETTY MUCH ALL THE METRICS, THE OPEN CEREMONY OF THE KAMALA HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN A GOLD MEDAL SUCCESS
FOR DEMOCRATS. SHE RACKED UP THOUSANDS OF DNC DELEGATES WITHOUT ANY FORMAL
CHALLENGE OR EMERGING PEER FROM THE CLINTONS TO CLUNY, BIG-NAME DEMOCRATS ALL GOT ON BOARD, CULMINATING IN A FORMAL ENDORSEMENT FROM MOST DECORATED
PARIS TEAM IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA PACKAGED IN THIS VIDEO FROM THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN. >> I CAN'T HAVE THIS PHONE CALL
WITHOUT SAYING TO MY GIRL, LOOK, I AM PROUD OF YOU.
>> WE ARE CALLING TO SAY MICHELLE AND I COULD NOT BE PROUDER TO ENDORSE YOU, TO GET YOU THROUGH THE ELECTION. >> I WANT TO TELL YOU, THE
WORDS YOU HAVE SPOKEN AND THE FRENCH IF YOU HAVE GIVEN ALL THESE YEARS MEAN MORE THAN I CAN EXPRESS HERE THANK YOU BOTH. IT MEANS SO MUCH.
AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN WITH THIS, TOO, AREN'T WE? >> PRESIDENT BIDEN WITH HIS SPOT ON THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET,
THE DUST SETTLES FROM HIS DECISION TO DROP YOU CAN IT LOOKS EXCEEDINGLY POPULAR. A NEW YORK TIMES POLL HAD 88% OF LIKELY VOTERS APPROVING HIS
DECISION INCLUDING 93% OF DEMOCRATS.
APPLE PIE AND SUNSHINE DON'T PULL THAT WELL IN 2024. THERE IS ALSO FRESH ENTHUSIASM FOR THE HARRIS TICKET INCLUDING BIG CROWDS AT HER WISCONSIN
EVENT ON TUESDAY. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS JOINED ZOOM CALLS FROM SUPPORTING GROUPS THAT CLAIMED TO HAVE RAISED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AS THE MONEY POURS IN, HARRIS
BACKING ENTITIES ARE HITTING THE AIRWAVES WITH NEW ADS LOOKING TO DEFINE THEIR CANDIDATE. THIS ONE EDUCATES ON HER BACKGROUND FROM A MAJOR PACK THAT WAS SUPPORTING PRESIDENT
BIDEN. >> SHE IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO STOOD UP TO THE BIG BANKS TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS AND WON. THE SENATOR WHO FOUGHT TO DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE
HER OWN MEDICAL DECISIONS AS AMERICA TURNS THE PAGE. KAMALA IS READY.
>> FOR ALL THE EXCITEMENT ON THE HARRIS SIDE, IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS IS A COMPETITIVE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. SHE IS STARTING FROM BEHIND WITH NOT A LOT OF TIME LEFT ON
THE CLOCK. THE NEW YORK TIMES SIENA POLL HAD PRESIDENT BIDEN TRAILING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP BY SIX POINTS EARLIER THIS MONTH. NOW, THE RACE IS ESSENTIALLY
TIED WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS. WHILE HARRIS AND HER CAMPAIGN DEFINED TO THE PUBLIC, TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN ARE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING.
THE TOP PRO TRUMP SUPER PACK PUT THIS AD OUT EARLIER THIS WEEK CLAIMING WITHOUT PARTICULAR EVIDENCE THAT SHE IS THE MASTERMIND OF THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION.
>> KAMALA NEW JOE COULDN'T DO THE JOB HERE SHE DID IT. WHAT SHE GOT DONE, A BORDER INVASION, RUNAWAY INFLATION, THE AMERICAN DREAM, DEAD.
THEY CREATED THIS MESS. THEY KNOW KAMALA OWNS THIS
FAILED RECORD. >> I'M JOINED NOW BY THE MASTERMINDS OF OUR COVERAGE OF THIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE ONSET. MARK JOINS ME WITH POLITICAL
REPORTER JOHN ALLEN. JOHN, LOOKING BACK EVERY THING WE HAVE SEEN SINCE SUNDAY, IF I CAN USE ONE MORE OLYMPICS PUN, DOES THE HARRIS IN PAIN FEEL
LIKE THEY HAVE STUCK THE LANDING SO FAR? >> IT IS FOUR YEARS COMPRESSED INTO A WEEK. DYLAN PICKS PARALLEL IS A GOOD ONE. I DO FEEL THEY HAVE STUCK THE
LANDING. THEY HAVE, IN TERMS OF UNITING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY VERY FAST. RIGHT? THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT BIDEN, NOT JUST AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL BUT IN THE SWING STATES
AMONG DEMOCRATS. YOU KNOW? HE DIDN'T HAVE 90% OF THE PARTY BEHIND HIM. NOW, YOU ARE SEEING THAT. YOU ARE SEEING EXCITEMENT, ENERGY, ENTHUSIASM, DONATIONS
THAT HAD DRIED UP FOR BIDEN ARE NOW FLOWING FREELY TO KAMALA HARRIS. THAT PART THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WRAP UP QUICKLY. THE QUESTION IS, CAN MAKE THE
NEXT DISTANCE?
WE WENT FROM A RACE JOE BIDEN LOOKED LIKE HE WAS DESTINED TO LOSE TO ONE THAT IS COMPETITIVE IN THE WAY YOU WOULD EXPECT
AFTER THE NEXT SEVERAL ELECTION CYCLES. >> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE POPULARITY OF THE BIDEN DECISION TO WITHDRAW? IS THIS A SNAPBACK TO NORMAL?
DOES THIS TELL US SOMETHING BIGGER ABOUT THE STATE OF POLITICS FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY? >> IT JUST SHOWS HOW UNPOPULAR JOE BIDEN WAS. IT WASN'T REPUBLICANS SAYING
WE DON'T WANT HIM IN THE RACE. YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT. HAVING 90% OF DEMOCRATS SAYING, YES, WE WANT OUR PRESIDENT OUT OF THE CONTEST, AND I THINK ONE
WAY TO LOOK AT KIND OF THE EUPHORIA THAT DEMOCRATS ARE HAVING RIGHT NOW, THE UNITY IS THAT, YES, THEY ARE SUPER EXCITED. A LOT OF IT IS A REFLECTION OF
HOW BAD THE THREE WEEKS WERE AFTER THE BAD DEBATE PERFORMANCE. ARGUABLY, THE THREE WORST WEEKS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAD SINCE HILLARY CLINTON LOST TO DONALD
TRUMP IN 2016. SO, THEY ARE SUPER EXCITED. THEY ARE ALSO PROBABLY SUPER EXCITED TO NOT BE IN THE POSITION THEY WERE IN RIGHT AFTER THE DEBATE PERFORMANCE
WHICH LOOKED LIKE A DESTINED LOSS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, LOSING THE WHITE HOUSE, LOSING SENATE SEATS, LOSING MORE HOUSE SEATS. >> I THINK THERE WERE A LOT OF
DEMOCRATS WHO WERE LOOKING AT JOE BIDEN CERTAINLY AFTER THE BAIT AND BEFORE,
THEMSELVES, THEY WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY VOTING IN GOOD CONSCIOUS FOR BIDEN. THEY SAW THE THINGS WE ALL SAW. THEY COULDN'T UN-SEE. KAMALA HARRIS GETS OUT THERE,
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE QUALMS. NONE OF THEM ARE THINKING TO THEMSELVES, IS SHE CAPABLE OF DOING THIS JOB? IS SHE COMPETENT? YOU KNOW?
IS SHE ON THE BALL? THEY FEEL LIKE SHE HAS. >> DEMOCRATS ARE SO EXCITED, THEY ARE SIGNING UP ON PURPOSE FOR ZOOM CALLS ON BEAUTIFUL
SUMMER EVENINGS TO HEAR FROM CANDIDATES. TALK ABOUT THIS KIND OF MODERN CAMPAIGN WE ARE SEEING. KAMALA HARRIS HAD NO PUBLIC EVENTS, BUT THEY ARE SEEING
SUCCESS FROM MASSIVE ZOOM CALLS. >> IT IS A HYBRID, RIGHT? WHAT THEY LEARNED IN 2020 WAS THEY COULD DO A LOT MORE FUNDRAISING AND OUTREACH VIA
ZOOM OR MICROSOFT TEAMS AS WE USE AT MBC. >> OH, GOD. >> THEY COULD USE THOSE TOOLS IN ORDER TO BASICALLY SPARE THE
MOST IMPORTANT ASSET IN THE CAMPAIGN, WHICH IS THE CANDIDATES TIME, AND EVERYBODY ELSE'S TIME.
YOU WILL SEE HER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, NO DOUBT. SHE IS GOOD ON STAGE. WE SAW THAT WITH THE LAUNCH OF HER PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN THAT
WE SAW THIS WEEK. SHE IS CAPABLE OF DOING BIG EVENTS AND GETTING ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM.
THEY LEARNED IN 2020 HOW MUCH MONEY THEY COULD RAISE, HOW MUCH POLITICAL OUTREACH THEY COULD DO BY HAVING A CANDIDATE DUE BACK TO BACK ZOOM CALLS,
NOT HER, THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER. THEY ARE TRYING TO INTEGRATE ALL THE TOOLS FROM THE LAST COUPLE ELECTION CYCLES TO GET THERE. >> THE MODERN WORK FROM HOME
CAMPAIGN. YOU ARE ARBITER ON ALL THINGS POLLING. ALASKA PULL BACK THE CURTAIN IF YOU WOULD. WE HAVE SEEN NATIONAL POLLING, NOTHING FROM THE STATE LEVEL
ABOUT THE STATE OF THIS RACE. WHAT DOES THE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE TO US REALLY TELL US ABOUT WHERE THE CAMPAIGN IS RIGHT NOW?
>> BEYOND THE FACT THAT HARRIS IS IN A BETTER POSITION THAN JOE BIDEN WAS AFTER THE DEBATE PERFORMANCE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CROSS TABS PARTICULARLY THE
NEW YORK TIMES SIENA COLLEGE POLL, IT STRIKES ME THAT THE GENDER GAP IS PLAYING OUT. AND HARRIS HAVING A HUMONGOUS ADVANTAGE AMONG FEMALE VOTERS,
AND DONALD TRUMP HAVING A BIG, IF NOT EVEN BIGGER ADVANTAGE AMONG MALE VOTERS. THEN ALSO, THE GEOGRAPHICAL BREAKDOWN, TOO.
THIS WILL BE FASCINATING PARTICULARLY ONCE WE START SEEING SOME OF THE GOOD STATE DATA THAT I HOPE IS COMING IN IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD.
AT LEAST THEN, THE NEW YORK TIMES SIENA POLL, HARRIS IS DOING SUPER WELL OUT IN THE WEST. AND THE NORTHEAST.
BUT NOT AS WELL IN THE MIDWEST AND THE SOUTH.
SO, AS WE ARE KIND OF EXTRAPOLATING WITH THE CAVEAT THERE ARE SOME BIG MARGINS OF ERRORS WHEN YOU HAVE THE GEOGRAPHICAL BREAKDOWNS, BUT, YOU KNOW, DOES SHE PLAY AS WELL
IN THE WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA AS GEORGIA, NEVADA, ARIZONA? WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. JOE BIDEN'S PATH, EVEN GOING INTO THAT DEBATE BEFORE THE
DEBATE PERFORMANCE, HE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PULL THE RUST BELT TRIFECTA TO GET THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES.
DOES SHE HAVE DIFFERENT PATHS? DOES SHE HAVE A GREATER PATH AT 270 ELECTORAL VOTES? I THINK WE WILL FIND OUT THE ANSWER. >> ONE OF THE WAYS A CANDIDATE
MIGHT SHORE UP THE VOTES WOULD BE PICKING A RUNNING MATE FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE COUNTRY. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THAT SEARCH FOR KAMALA HARRIS?
>> WE KNOW THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IT MORE OPENLY AS IT'S GOING ON. EVERYBODY KIND OF KNEW THAT. I THINK, ALMOST EVERYBODY I SPOKE TO SAID SHE NEEDS TO PICK
A WHITE MAN. YOU KNOW, EVERYONE CAN DISSECT WHY THEY THINK THAT.
THAT SEEMS TO BE A BALANCE THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. OBVIOUSLY, SHE DOESN'T NEED SOMEBODY ELSE TO MAKE HISTORY. SHE HAS GOT THAT ASSET WORKING
FOR HER. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW, NUMBER ONE, SHE WILL CHOOSE WHO DOES
THE LEAST HARM. AND NUMBER TWO, WHO SHE SENDS A MESSAGE WITH WITH HER CHOICE. YOU KNOW? THERE'S ALL THIS TALK ABOUT
REGIONAL STATE BALANCE, PUTTING NORTH CAROLINA OR WHATEVER -- ACTUALLY, WHAT MATTERS MORE,
WHO IS SHE SIGNALING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS THE NEXT
PERSON SHE SHOULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HER, IF SHE SHOULD STEP ASIDE? YOU KNOW?
I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO END UP HERE YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE CANDIDATES, TIM WALZ, GOVERNOR OF MINNESOTA, MARK KELLY, THE GOVERNOR OF
NORTH CAROLINA, JOSH SHAPIRO, GRETCHEN WHITMER -- THEY ALL
HAVE THEIR OWN ATTRIBUTES. ALL OF THEM, ANY OF THEM, IF THEY GET PICKED WILL GO THROUGH WHAT WE SEE J.D. VANCE GOING THROUGH A REPUBLIC
INSIDE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS A SUPERQUICK THAT BY THE MEDIA AND OPPOSING PARTY. >> WE WILL LEARN A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE VERY QUICKLY.
I WILL GIVE YOU A QUICK LAST WORD. IF YOU ARE THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN, ARE YOU LOOKING AT POLLS THAT SHOW YOU CLOSING THE GAP THAT
STILL VERY MUCH THAT YOU ARE BEHIND WITH THE MARGIN OF ERROR? IS THE CUP HALF FULL, HALF
EMPTY? HOW SHOULD THEY LOOK AT THE DATA THEY ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW? >> THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE DATA THEY HAVE RETURNED BACK TO THE POLITICAL SITUATION
BEFORE THE DEBATE. I THINK THAT IS KIND OF WHERE -- WE ARE BACK -- 5050, 4060, 6040, THAT IS THE SITUATION
RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW? IN OUR POLARIZED TIMES, I ALWAYS THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, WE
HAVE BEEN IN THE 50-50 -- >> CORRECT.
>> WAS GOING TO END UP DECIDING THE RACE IS THE NEWS ENVIRONMENT, THE EVENTS THAT END UP HAPPENING
Netanyahu visits Trump following White House meetings
OR FOUR WEEKS AHEAD OF THE ELECTION. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS CHAOTIC LAST MONTH. I THINK WE ARE IN STORE FOR ANOTHER THREE MONTHS OF THAT.
>> WE ARE NOT EVEN HURRICANE SEASON YET. JOHN ALLEN, MARK MURRAY, THANK YOU FOR COMING. I DIDN'T GET THE MEMO ABOUT BUSINESS CASUAL. NEXT FRIDAY, I WILL BE READY.
>> LOSE THE TIE! >>> MAR-A-LAGO TODAY, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. IT'S THEIR FIRST MEETING SINCE TRUMP LEFT OFFICE. DURING BRIEF REMARKS TO THE
PRESS AFTERWARD, THE FORMER PRESIDENT TOUTED HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH NETANYAHU AND REPEATED HIS LAIM AGAIN WITHOUT ANY PROOF THAT IF YOU WERE TO RETURN TO THE WHITE
HOUSE, THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST WOULD, QUOTE, WORK OUT VERY QUICKLY. THAT COMES AFTER NETANYAHU MET SEPARATELY WITH THE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND VICE PRESIDENT
HARRIS. SPEAKING AFTER THAT MEETING, WE GOT A GLIMPSE INTO HOW HARRIS PLANS TO NAVIGATE THE ISSUES OF THE ISRAEL HAMAS WAR AS THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE, WALKING A
FINE LINE BETWEEN SUPPORTING ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF AND CALLING FOR A CEASE-FIRE IN THE END TO HUMANITARIAN SUFFERING IN GAZA. >> I SAID IT MANY TIMES, BUT IT
BEARS REPEATING. ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF. THE IMAGES OF DEAD CHILDREN AND DESPERATE, HUNGRY PEOPLE FLEEING FOR SAFETY, SOMETIMES DISPLACED FOR THE SECOND,
THIRD, OR FOURTH TIME. WE CANNOT LOOK AWAY IN THE FACE
OF THESE TRAGEDIES. WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BECOME NUMB TO THE SUFFERING. AND I WILL NOT BE SILENT. SO, TO EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN
CALLING FOR A CEASE-FIRE, AND TO EVERYONE WHO YEARNS FOR PEACE, ICU, AND I HEAR YOU. LET'S GET THE DEAL DONE SO WE CAN GET A CEASE-FIRE TO END THE
WAR. >> WITH ME ONSETHIS FOREIGN
AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT ANDREA MITCHELL. ANDREA, IT IS STRIKING WE DID NOT HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE HEARD FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT.
NO DIFFERENCE IN POLICY, BUT CERTAINLY NOTABLE DIFFERENCES IN TONE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE NUANCES? >> ABSOLUTELY, YOU GOT IT. THAT WAS THE PERFECT PART OF
HER COMMENTS LAST NIGHT. SHE WAS EMPHASIZING THE HUMANITARIAN DISASTER, THE NEED TO GET THE HOSTAGES HOME. THE NEED TO END THE WAR, WHICH
IS NOT THE FIRST EMPHASIS OF NETANYAHU. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WANTED TO PROJECT. HE CAME HERE THINKING HE WOULD HAVE THIS GREAT STAGE. INSTEAD, UNEXPECTEDLY, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS STANDING DOWN FROM THE CAMPAIGN. AND NOW, THE LIKELY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WILL BE THE VICE PRESIDENT. HE MET HER ONCE IN 2017 WHEN
SHE WAS A SENATOR. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP HE HAD WITH JOE BIDEN, WHICH WAS SUCH LONG
STANDING THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF FRICTION FROM A LOT OF DISAGREEMENTS. >> YOU DON'T KNOW ANYBODY FOR 40 YEARS AND GET ALONG THE
WHOLE TIME. >> THIS WASN'T A GOOD MARRIAGE.
THIS WAS A BAD MARRIAGE. BUT THEY MANAGED TO KEEP IT TOGETHER. IN ANY CASE, SHE PUTS THE EMPHASIS MORE ON THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. SHE HAS A LIFELONG COMMITMENT
TO ISRAEL AS A LITTLE GIRL.
SHE RAISED MONEY FOR THE STATE OF ISRAEL, REPLANTING OF TREES, SHE IS MARRIED TO A JEWISH MAN. THEY ARE OBSERVING. THEY FOLLOW THE HOLIDAYS.
DOUG HAS BEEN CAMPAIGNING AND MAKING SPEECHES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FOR THE PAST YEAR ABOUT THE ANTI-SEMITISM. >> EXACTLY.
>> AND IT IS DEEPLY FELT. SHE HAS HER STREET CREDIT ON ALL OF THAT. SHE PUTS A LOT OF EMPHASIS MORE THAN THE ADMINISTRATION DID
EARLY ON AFTER SOME DISASTROUS AIRSTRIKES IN GAZA THREE WEEKS INTO THE WAR, SHE WAS NOTING,
TRUE TO HER VALUES, THE DEVASTATION, THE FAMINE, AND THE NEED TO GET HOSTAGES HOME. AND THE PRESIDENT HAS COME AROUND TO THAT.
SHE WAS THERE BEFORE. HE KEEPS RAISING NEW OBSTACLES
ON A DEAL THAT IS ON THE TABLE. IN ADDITION TO IT, THE NIGHT HE
COMES TO THE WHITE HOUSE, HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS MEETING FOR 3 YEARS, GARRETT, HE FINALLY GETS IT, BUT HE HAS TO ATTEND THE MEETING WITH THE
AMERICAN HOSTAGE FAMILIES WHO ARE ALREADY ANGRY AT HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE INVITED TO AN INTIMATE MEETING WITH HIM ON MONDAY NIGHT AT HIS HOTEL AND
DISCOVERED HE BROUGHT A LOT OF
ISRAELIS WHO ARE SUPPORTERS OF HIS, ON HIS PLANE, AND THEY WERE DOMINATING THE MEETING. >> WE HAD SOME OF THE FAMILIES ON THE BROADCAST YESTERDAY.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE EFFORT THE PRIME MINISTER WENT THROUGH TO GET DOWN TO FLORIDA, TO MEET WITH DONALD TRUMP HE HAD NOT MET
WITH IN PERSON -- WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT HOW HE VIEWS THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL STATION IN THE UNITED STATES? WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE THEORY
HE WOULD RATHER BE WORKING ON THE ISSUE WITH DONALD TRUMP COME NEXT JANUARY THAN TRYING TO FIND THE CEASE-FIRE DEAL RIGHT NOW WITH JOE BIDEN?
>> AS YOU REPORTED, YOU KNOW, THEY HAD THEIR OWN FRICTION, THEIR OWN MOMENTS. BUT CLEARLY, HE IS MORE COMFORTABLE WITH DONALD TRUMP HERE FIRST OF ALL, HE PROLONGED
HIS TRIP. HE NEEDED TO BE BACK, WE WERE TOLD, THAT HE HAD TO BE BACK BY 8:00 TONIGHT, ISRAELI TIME.
FRIDAY NIGHT, THE SABBATH, TO OBSERVE THE SABBATH. INSTEAD, HE IS STAYING OVER UNTIL THE SABBATH IS OVER, ANOTHER 24 HOURS, BY THE
TEACHER OR -- BY THE DETOUR TO MAR-A-LAGO. HE IS ALSO PRAISING HIM IN HIS SPEECH.
AND IT IS A VERY HARD RIGHT NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, THE DAY OF THE SPEECH, ANNOUNCED HE WAS ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP. CABINET MEMBERS IN ALLIED
GOVERNMENTS DO NOT ENDORSE OPPOSITION, YOU KNOW, CANDIDATES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAMPAIGN. >> THERE'S A LOT GOING ON UNDER THE SURFACE. POLITICS IS LOCAL.
THANK YOU FOR BREAKING DOWN HOW
ALL OF THIS IS CONNECTED. WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP, CONGO AND JIM CLYBURN JOINS ME NEXT WITH HIS
VIEW ON THE DEMOCRATS SPRINT IN NOVEMBER WHEN A BLACK WOMAN AT THE TOP OF THE
One-on-one with Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC)
>> PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, AND EACH OF THERE.
>>> WELCOME BACK. ACCORDING TO THE DNC RULES, THERE IS ONE MORE DAY FOR ANY CHALLENGER TO VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS TO DECLARE THEIR INTENT TO RUN FOR THE NOMINATION.
HARRIS HAS BEEN GAINED ENDORSEMENTS NOT JUST FOR THE
CONVENTION, BUT MOST OF BIG NAMES IN HER PARTY, INCLUDING AS WE MENTIONED, THE BIGGEST NAMES BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA. JOINING ME NOW IS A LONGTIME
LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, ONE OF THOSE NAMES, JIM
CLYBURN. CONGRESSMAN, I WANT TO START ON JUST THIS WEEK THAT VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS HAS HAD. YOU OBVIOUSLY ALREADY ENDORSED HER, BUT BEFORE THE PRESIDENT
WITHDREW, YOU SAID IT WERE TO HAPPEN, THE PARTIES SHOULD NOT TRY TO WORK AGAINST HER. ARE YOU SURPRISED AT ALL THAT NO ONE IN THE PARTY HAS WORKED
AGAINST HER, AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS COALESCED SO QUICKLY AROUND HER? >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. I AM JUST SLIGHTLY SURPRISED.
BUT I THINK MOST OF THE DELEGATES ARE PRETTY MUCH IN TOUCH WITH THE HISTORY OF OUR
PARTY. MOST OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AROUND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR A LONG TIME. THEY KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.
IF YOU HAVE WIDE OPEN CONVENTION AS WE HAVE HAD BEFORE WHAT HAPPENED IN 1968, 1972, 1980, ALL OF THOSE WIDE-
OPEN CONVENTIONS RESULTED IN DRAMATIC LOSSES, RICHARD NIXON,
THAT WAS 68, AND 72. THERE WAS ONE STATE AFTER 1972.
SO, WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER QUICKLY, COALESCED BEHIND A NOMINEE. AND
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT.
THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN IN OFFICE NOW FOR 3 YEARS, 3.5 YEARS.
AND BEFORE THAT, SHE WAS IN THE SENATE. BEFORE THAT, SHE WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA. BEFORE THAT, A PROSECUTING DA.
SHE HAS A TREMENDOUS RESUME, ONE THAT LENDS ITSELF WELL TO
BEING ABLE TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS OF THIS COUNTRY FAMOUSLY.
AND SHE WILL DO THAT.
I THINK THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO ELECT HER. >> THE LAST THREE YEARS OF THE RESUME, HER TIME AS VICE PRESIDENT, DOES THAT WORK FOR
HER OR AGAINST HER? I KNOW YOU ARE PROUD OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RECORD. REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO TRY TO HANG ELEMENTS OF IT AROUND HER
NECK GOING FORWARD. >> I HOPE THEY WILL. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THE RECORD OF THE BIDEN HARRIS ADMINISTRATION
AND COMPARE THAT TO THE
PROPOSALS COMING FORTH FROM THE OTHER SIDE IN THEIR PROJECT 2025. I HAVE BEEN SAYING TO PEOPLE ALL OVER, WHATEVER YOUR INTEREST IS, SOCIAL SECURITY,
MEDICARE, EDUCATION, CIVIC SERVICE, WHATEVER IT IS, LOOK UP
PROJECT 2025, THEN GO TO THAT
SECTION OF THE 900 PAGES AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE PROPOSING FOR YOUR INTEREST. WHAT DO YOU MEAN DOING AWAY
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL SERVICE? EMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY, TURNING THAT OVER TO
ONE PERSON, SO YOU DO THEIR BIDDING, RATHER THAN THE
BIDDING OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE? SOUNDS LIKE WOODROW WILSON TO ME. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT TO
HAVE IN OUR GOVERNMENT. >> CONGRESSMAN, I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IN THE VIDEO THEY DEBUTED. YOU CAN HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF
THE CHANGE IN TONE, THE NUANCE OF LANGUAGE HERE. THE VICE PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT FREEDOM, DEFENDING PERSONAL FREEDOM. THE SHIFT FROM THE WAY THE PRESIDENT SPOKE ABOUT DEFENDING
DEMOCRACY. AS THAT IS THE CHANGE THAT MATTERS? DO YOU THINK AMERICANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DIALED INTO CONCERNS ON THEIR FREEDOMS MORE THAN THE ABSTRACT CONCEPT OF
DEFENDING DEMOCRACY? >> THAT TAKES US BACK TO THE KIND OF BASIC LANGUAGE THAT WE
STARTED USING A LONG, LONG TIME AGO, THE FREEDOM TO VOTE, THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE, THE FREEDOM TO GO UP AT YOUR BUSINESS.
THIS IS WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WORD, FREEDOM.
YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE TRYING TO DEFINE WHAT DEMOCRACY REALLY MEANS. THEY UNDERSTAND INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS.
AND THAT IS A GOOD WAY TO RELATE TO PEOPLE. >> YOU TOLD USA TODAY EARLIER THIS WEEK, QUOTE, WE THOUGHT WE
WERE READY FOR THAT, MEANING, A WOMAN TO BE PRESIDENT IN 2016, AND WE WEREN'T READY FOR THAT. I WONDER AS WE SIT HERE IN
2024, IS THE COUNTRY READY NOW? >> I CERTAINLY HOPE SO, AS A FATHER OF THREE DAUGHTERS, I WORK EVERY DAY TRYING TO MAKE
SURE I MAKE THIS A BETTER PLACE FOR THEM TO GROW UP IN. NOW, THOSE DAUGHTERS OF MINE ARE ALREADY GROWN. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF
GRANDCHILDREN, AND A GREAT GRANDCHILD. I HAVE GOT TWO GRANDDAUGHTERS AND ONE GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER. I WANT THEM TO HAVE A COUNTRY TO GROW IN MUCH, MUCH DIFFERENT
FROM THE ONE I GREW UP IN. >> I WANT TO ASK YOU, AS SOME
WOMAN WITH TWO DAUGHTERS MYSELF, I AM DIALED IN, TOO. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE
STAKES HERE. THEY ARE VETTING SOME FOLKS. YOU HAVE NAME CHECK TO THE GOVERNORS, SHAPIRO, COPPER, WALTZ, AS WELL AS SECRETARY DUE TO JUDGE. THAT'S ABOUT HALF THE LIST WE
HAVE HERE RIGHT NOW. SO, I WONDER WHAT YOU MAKE OF THE LIST, AND WHO YOU THINK COMPLEMENTS HER THE BEST. >> WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST
MENTIONED IMPORTANT DATA AS IT RELATES TO THE MIDWEST. I THINK WALTZ IS GREAT FOR THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT IT UNIVERSALLY, LOOK AT FOREIGN SERVICE.
DUE TO JUDGE IS GREAT FOR THAT. LAST TIME I CHECKED, I THINK HE SPEAKS SEVEN OR EIGHT DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE. HE IS A TREMENDOUS CABINET SECRETARY.
HE HAS DEVELOPED A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOVERNORS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. HE WOULD DO GREAT THERE. JOSH SHAPIRO, I LIKE VERY MUCH.
I KNOW HIM VERY WELL. I KNOW THAT WALTZ BRINGS A LOT
TO THE TABLE.
ANOTHER FROM THE MILITARY SIDE, BUT WALTZ WAS THE HIGHEST RANKING -- WHAT DO THEY CALL IT?
THE NATIONAL GUARDS, NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER IN THE COUNTRY. HE HAS A TREMENDOUS BACKGROUND
WHEN IT COMES TO THE MILITARY.
HE IS FROM WHAT YOU CALL THE MIDWEST. HE WOULD DO IT.
SHE HAS GOT A GREAT LINEUP FOR HER TEARS. >> YOU ARE PUTTING MORE NAMES ON THE LIST, NOT TAKING THEM OFF. WE ARE WORKING BACKWARDS HERE.
LET ME ASK THE QUESTION THIS WAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN HOW SHE MAKES THIS DECISION? >> CHEMISTRY.
CHEMISTRY. >> PERSONAL CHEMISTRY? >> ABSOLUTELY. WHO -- IS HE COMPARABLE ALONGSIDE OF? THE VIBES THAT COME FROM THAT,
THAT IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. WE ALREADY SEE THE OTHER SIDE
HAVING PROBLEMS WITH CHEMISTRY. THERE IS BAD CHEMISTRY BETWEEN
TRUMP AND J.D. VANCE. IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE. >> AS YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS RACE, AS YOU ARE PEERING ACROSS THE BORDER INTO NORTH CAROLINA,
DO YOU THINK HAVING KAMALA HARRIS AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET CHANGES THE MAP AT ALL? WE TALK ABOUT THE POLLING. YOU ARE A SOUTHERNER.
SHE POLLING BETTER THAN PRESIDENT BIDEN DID? >> IN BOTH OF THOSE, I THINK SO. SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE HE ENERGIZES THE YOUNG VOTERS IN -- MUCH MORE THAN BIDEN DID HERE
HE WAS WINNING THEM, SINGLE DIGITS. SHE NOW SEEMS TO BE WINNING THEM BY DOUBLE DIGITS.
IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO LEAD BY DOUBLE DIGITS.
>> THAT IS THE KIND OF POLITICAL WISDOM YOU ONLY GET FROM DECADES IN CONGRESS. CONGRESSMAN JIM CLYBURN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON A FRIDAY
AFTERNOON.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME. >>> UP NEXT, THE DEBATE OVER DEBATES. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS ACCUSES FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP OF BACKPEDALI
TOP STORY WITH TOM LLAMAS'S, STREAMING NBC NEWS NOW.
Panel: Trump campaign won't commit to debate until Harris is formally nominated
>>> NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW.
>> WELCOME BACK. WHAT WE SAID EARLIER, WHAT BEGAN AS A MARATHON ELECTION
SEASON BETWEEN JOB BIDEN AND DONALD TRUMP QUICKLY EVOLVED INTO AN ALL-OUT SPRINT FOR THE
NEW NOMINEE, KAMALA HARRIS WITH OVER 100 DAYS TO MAKE HER PITCH TO VOTERS. IT SEEMS DONALD TRUMP MIGHT WANT TO SLOW THINGS DOWN A
LITTLE BIT WHEN IT COMES TO HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE. IN A NEW STATEMENT HIS CAMPAIGN] GIVEN THE CONTINUED POLITICAL CHAOS SURROUNDING CROOKED JOE
BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, DEBATE DETAILS CANNOT BE FINALIZED UNTIL DEMOCRATS FORMALLY DECIDE ON THEIR NOMINEE. JOINING ME NOW TO BREAK DOWN
WHAT THAT MEANS IS OUR PANEL, SENIOR NATIONAL CUP POLITICAL REPORTER, MS. KUMAR, AND NBC
NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, AND MARC SHORT, THE CHIEF OF STAFF TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. HE IS ALSO AN NBC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR.
SAHIL, THE CAMPAIGN IS STALLING AND TROLLING. WHAT DO YOU MAKE? IS THERE A POLITICAL STRATEGY TO DRAG THINGS OUT A LITTLE BIT? OR IS THIS SOME KIND OF NOT
EXACTLY HAVING A PLAN FOR THIS NEW NOMINEE? >> THIS STRATEGY IS SIMPLE. TRUMBULL ONLY DEBATE IF HE THINKS IT WILL BE IN HIS POLITICAL INTEREST.
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT TRADITION. HE WILL DO IT BECAUSE OF PRESSURE FROM PENDANTS. EVERY TIME HE HAS DEBATED, HE HAS DONE IT BECAUSE HE BELIEVES
HE HAS SOMETHING TO GAIN FROM IT. IN THIS PRIMARIES, HE NEEDED
INTRODUCE HIMSELF. HE HAD TO DEBATE. THE 2024 PRIMARIES, HE DID NOT DEBATE BECAUSE HE WAS AHEAD OF HIS RIVALS. HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE
CRITICISM FROM 2016 AND 2020. HE DEBATED BECAUSE HE HAD TO. I THINK HE IS GOING TO FEEL THIS OUT, MAKE THE CALCULATION AS TO WHETHER THIS WILL BE
BENEFICIAL FOR HIM, WHETHER IT WILL BE HURTFUL TO HIM. HE AGREED WITH THAT EARLY DEBATE WITH JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE KEPT ELATED JOE BIDEN WAS
NOT GOING TO HANDLE IT WELL. HE WAS VERY RIGHT ABOUT THAT. NOW YOU HAVE KAMALA HARRIS, A WOMAN 19 YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIM. THE CONTRAST WILL BE VERY
DIFFERENT. >> YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN TO WRITE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW PETE BUTTIGIEG HAS BEEN TRYING TO BAIT DONALD TRUMP. LISTEN. >> TOUGH TALK IS THIS GUY IS
CALLING CARD. NOW, THERE IS THIS EXTRAORDINARY SHOW OF WEAKNESS. IT SHOWS HE IS AFRAID. IT SHOWS HE KNOWS IF THE TWO OF THEM ARE ON A STAGE TOGETHER,
IT'S NOT GOING TO END WELL FOR HIM. >> MARK, AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED FOR A CANDIDATE WHO TRIED TO GO DONALD TRUMP INTO DEBATING, HOW
EFFECTIVE DO YOU THINK THE STRATEGY IS TO GET HIM ON STAGE WITH KAMALA HARRIS? >> I DON'T THINK PETE BUTTIGIEG IS THE VOICE FOR THAT ARGUMENT.
>> IF HE DID IT ON FOX NEWS AS OPPOSED TO MSNBC? >> NO, IF HE DID HIS JOB AS PRESS SECRETARY, THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED AS OPPOSED TO
AUDITIONING FOR VICE PRESIDENT EVERY DAY, TO BE HELPFUL TO THE COUNTRY. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK DONALD TRUMP WILL END UP
DEBATING. THIS IS PART OF HIS GAME. I THINK HE WILL DEBATE THE NOMINEE. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS HERE?
DONALD TRUMP IS COMPLAINING ABOUT IT BEING ON ABC. HE WANTS TO MOVE IT TO FOX. SHOULD THE HARRIS POSITION B -- WE CAN DO IT ON NEWSMAX.
WE CAN DO IT WHENEVER, WHEREVER? SHOULD SHE BE CAREFUL AS WELL? >> WHAT WE SAW WHEN NEWSOM WENT
UP AGAINST DeSANTIS ON FOX NEWS, THEY HAVE BASICALLY -- FROM THE CONVERSATION I HAD WITH THE GOVERNOR, THEY DIDN'T PLAY BY THE RULES THEY SET IN
ADVANCE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT FOR HARRIS TO DO THAT. FOX NEWS BREAKS THE RULES. EVERYWHERE ELSE IS AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CONVERSATION. >> BUT IF YOU ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, YOU CAN'T RUN FROM SEAN HANNITY? >> IT'S A MATTER OF RECOGNIZING
THAT ONCE YOU GO ON FOX NEWS, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PLAY BY THE RULES. IF YOU ASKED ME IF SHE WILL BE READY, ABSOLUTELY.
IS SHE GOING TO GROW HER BASE ON FOX NEWS? I DON'T KNOW? I THINK SHE IS WELL SERVED GOING ON YOUTUBE AND HAVING DEBATES ON YOUTUBE WHERE SHE
CAN GROW HER BASE ON YOUNG VOTERS. YOU ARE LAUGHING. I THINK BECAUSE YOU HAVE KAMALA HARRIS RIGHT NOW, IT'S GOING TO BE EASY BAIT FOR THE FAR RIGHT.
WHAT THEY DID NOT ANTICIPATE WAS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE ALL THESE YOUNG VOTERS THAT ALL THE SUDDEN ARE COMPLETELY IN HER
FAVOR. I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
WE WERE STRUGGLING TO REGISTER VOTERS. WE ARE REGISTERING THEM RIGHT NOW AT CLOSE TO 7000 PEOPLE A DAY, THE FASTEST CLIP WE HAVE SEEN.
WE DON'T EXPECT THOSE CLIPS UNTIL AFTER LABOR DAY. THEY ARE LIKING THE PRODUCT
THAT NOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE SELLING. >> YOU ARE CHAMPING AT THE BIT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT ARGUMENT? ALSO, THE IDEA TO -- THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN WAS NOT TRYING TO WIN YOUNG VOTES AS MUCH AS THEY WERE TRYING TO SUPPRESS THEIR INTERESTS IN THE RACE. HOW DO YOU THINK THE HARRIS
PICK CHANGES THE GAME? >> I THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF
AMERICA DID NOT LIKE TRUMP VERSUS BIDEN. THEY WERE TIRED OF BOTH OF THEM. I THINK SHE IS A FRESH FACE. SHE IS SOMEBODY WHO WEARS THIN
OVERTIME. THAT'S WHY WHEN SHE RAN FOR PRESIDENT, SHE STARTED OUT FRONT AND ASCENDED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. SHE ONLY HAS 100 DAYS. THEY COULD GET AN ADVANTAGE ON
HER TREMENDOUSLY. AMERICA WAS LOOKING FOR A FRESH FACE. I WAS LAUGHING AT FOX, AS IF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA ISN'T BIASED. HE GOT EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED
OUT OF THAT ON THE SEAN HANNITY SHOW.
MARK McALLEN, I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. >> IT IS IN THE DATA. YOUNG AND HISPANIC VOTERS ARE MORE EXCITED ABOUT THE HARRIS
CANDIDACY. THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS TELLING ANYONE WHO WILL LISTEN THIS DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE AHEAD. DO NOT MISTAKE ENTHUSIASM FOR A DEAD HEAT.
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT DECISION OF HER
RACE, YOU AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS ON CAPITOL HILL COLLEAGUES. WE ARE JUST THIS CLOSE TO PEOPLE OPENLY CAMPAIGNING FOR
THE JOB
THE MARK KELLY'S OF THE WORLD? OTHER FOLKS WERE TRYING TO PUT THEIR CARDS ON THE TABLE? THEY WANT THIS GIG. >> THEY ARE OPENLY CAMPAIGNING.
THEY ARE DOING IT INTELLIGENTLY WHILE DOING IT. ON CAPITOL HILL, MARKET KELLY IS A PERSON WE KNOW IS BEING VETTED. HE COMES WITH ADVANTAGES.
THERE ARE NUMBER OF GOVERNORS WHO COME WITH THEIR OWN ADVANTAGES. SHE WILL HAVE TO EVALUATE THIS ON THREE DIMENSIONS. ONE IS THE POLITICAL PATH, WHO
HELPS HER GET TO 270 VOTES? SHE IS FROM CALIFORNIA. IT MIGHT HELP TO HAVE SOMEONE FROM THE MIDWEST. THAT IS AN ARGUMENT BEING MADE,
SOMEONE WHO HAS THE SKILL SET WHO CAN COMPLEMENT HER OWN? AND THE THIRD IS WHAT YOU WERE TALKING TO JAMES CLYBURN ABOUT, CHEMISTRY, WHO DOES SHE LIKE,
WHO DOES SHE TRUST? YOU HAD SOMEONE LIKE BARACK OBAMA WITH JOE BIDEN, YOU CAN PICK TWO OF THOSE THINGS. >> WHO DOES THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
LEAST WANT TO SEE ON THAT TICKET? WHO MAKES THEM THE MOST NERVOUS? >> I WOULD PROBABLY SAY SCHAPIRO. I THINK SHE NEEDS TO HAVE
SOMEBODY WHO IS MODERATE. I THINK IT BALANCES HER PROGRESSIVE TENDENCIES. EVEN MORE LIBERAL THAN BERNIE SANDERS IN THE SENATE. ALSO, PENNSYLVANIA IS BENEFICIAL TO THEM.
THERE IS A CONCERN FOR SOME ABOUT THE ANTI-SEMITISM IN HER PARTY. HAVING JOSH SHAPIRO WOULD BE ROUNDING OUT FOR KAMALA HARRIS. >> IT CERTAINLY MAKES THAT
ARGUMENT. DO YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS? HOW DO YOU SEE THE DECISION COMING TOGETHER? >> ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO
BE ABLE TO SEE FOR HER IS NOT TO WALK INTO THE SAME MISTAKE THAT HILLARY CLINTON DID, WHERE SHE PICKED TIM KAINE WHO WAS
REALLY APPEALING ON PAPER TO MODERATE, INDEPENDENT VOTERS. THAT DIDN'T BRING HER ANYBODY. IT'S A CALCULATION OF, WHO IS
ACTUALLY GOING TO COMPLEMENT, LIKE TO BRING OTHER VOTERS IN AND NEUTRALIZE OTHERS? >> THIS IS THE TRAP OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT -- >> IT'S SO MUCH FUN, THOUGH.
>> ON THE QUESTION OF VICE PRESIDENTS, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT HAS BEEN OUT THERE? I HAVE BEEN A SKEPTIC. -- ABOUT
BUYERS REMORSE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, OR TRUMP WORLD OF J.D. VANCE AS THE NOMINEE ON THAT SIDE? >> I WOULD PROBABLY BE A SKEPTIC ON THAT, TOO.
I THINK HE FITS WHERE TRUMP IS, SORT OF IN THE POPULIST APPEAL RIGHT NOW WITHIN THE PARTY. DONALD TRUMP IS KNOWN FOR SECOND-GUESSING DECISIONS.
THAT IS PART OF THE DYNAMIC AROUND HIM. I CAN'T TELL YOU THERE ISN'T SOME OF THAT. BUT I THINK THERE IS BEING TOO MUCH MADE OF THAT.
>>
DEMOCRATS ON THE HILL, NATIONALLY, THE ACTIVIST GROUPS YOU TALKED TO, WE HEARD IT FROM JIM CLYBURN JUST A MOMENT AGO. THE VIBE SHIFT AMONG DEMOCRATS
SEEMS TO BE DIFFERENT. THEY DON'T HAVE TO SUSTAIN IT FOREVER, BUT THEY HAVE TO SUSTAIN IT FOR HUNDRED DAYS. HOW DO YOU VIEW THE LANDSCAPE
RIGHT NOW? >> GENERALLY, THE MOOD AMONG DEMOCRATS HAS GONE FROM DREAD TO HOPE. IT WAS REALLY BAD IN THE LAST FEW YEARS OF THE BIDEN
CAMPAIGN. IT FELT LIKE THE WHEELS ARE COMING OFF. THEY HAD A CANDIDATE WHO COULD NOT COMMUNICATE OR DRIVE A MESSAGE. THEY STAYED SAFE WITH TRUMP
LOOKING LIKE WHAT WE SAW. DOWN THE BALLOT THERE IS A FEAR DEMOCRATS HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE. THE THINKING IS, IF THEY WILL CONTINUE RUNNING THE RACE AS
THEY WERE, THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP IT LOCAL, CANDIDATES ON THE SENATE, THEY HAVE TO IN RED STATES, AND CANDIDATES IN THE HOUSE ARE OVERPERFORMING BIDEN.
THE REPUBLICAN PLAYBOOK CHANGES ENTIRELY. THEY WERE TYING EVERY DEMOCRAT TO BIDEN. NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO TIE THEM FROMMOLLY HARRIS.
THEY WILL PULL FROM HER CAMPAIGN HEAVILY. ALL THE POSITIONS SHE TOOK, THEY WILL TRY TO PAINT HER OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM. >> I DON'T HAVE TIME TO ASK
THIS, BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO. THE POLLING DATA SHOWS OPTIMISM THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT. A 24 POINT ADVANTAGE WITH LIKELY HISPANIC VOTERS OVER
DONALD TRUMP. IT WAS JUST A ONE POINT ADVANTAGE FOR JOE BIDEN. CAN SHE LOCK THAT IN? CAN SHE GROW THAT? HAS AN EVENT WILL THE ADVANTAGE
BE? >> I WILL TELL YOU WE HOSTED AN EVENT AT THE PRESIDENTS HOUSE YESTERDAY. ENTHUSIASM OF FOLKS WHO HAVE DROPPED THEIR BAGS ON 24 HOURS
TO COME AND HELP ORGANIZE, THEY ARE THE TOP OF THE CROP IN THE LOCAL AREAS. AND THEY CAME OUT. IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE EXCITED.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE DONALD TRUMP IS AND WHERE THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN IS NOT, DEMOCRATS ARE ENERGIZED TO GO OUT. WE WERE NOT SURE IF INDEPENDENT
AND FOLKS ON THE FENCE WOULD COME OUT FOR KAMALA HARRIS. THEY ARE GOING FROM SAYING, I WILL VOTE NOT ONLY FOR KAMALA HARRIS, BUT I AM NOT
CONSIDERING A THIRD-PARTY. IT IS HUGE. >> WE ARE HAVING POLITICAL EVENTS AT THE VICE PRESIDENT'S RESIDENCE? >> I'M GREAT. I AM FINE.
>> THANK YOU ALL FOR C ANY OTHE ORGANIZATION. >> WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE?
Opening ceremony held along the Seine
â™ª
>>> WELCOME BACK. THE PARIS OLYMPICS ARE OFFICIALLY UNDERWAY. THE OPENING CEREMONY IS TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW. IT IS THE FIRST TIME EVER THE CEREMONY IS NOT TAKING PLACE
INSIDE A STADIUM, BUT RATHER ALONG THE STAND WITH ATHLETES
CHEERED BY SPECTATORS LINING THE RIVER'S BANKS. SECURITY FOR THE OLYMPIC GAMES IS EXTREMELY TIGHT WITH MORE THAN 45,000 POLICE OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS PATROLLING PARIS.
JUST HOURS BEFORE TODAY'S OPENING CEREMONY, PARTS OF FRANCE'S HIGH-SPEED RAIL NETWORK
WERE PARALYZED BY A MASSIVE ATTACK. IT DAMAGED SEVERAL FACILITIES.
I'M JOINED BY STEPHANIE GOSS IN PARIS AND FOR MORE ON THE ATTACK ON FRANCE'S RAIL NETWORK, I AM JOINED BY INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT TOM
WINTER WHO IS NOT IN PARIS. STEPHANIE, TALK TO ME ABOUT THE SECURITY SITUATION ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW.
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, GARRETT, I HAVE BEEN TO A LOT OF PLACES
FOR HIGHLY SECURED EVENTS, WHETHER IT BE THE POPE IN NEW YORK, WHEREVER IT MIGHT BE. I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN OPERATION QUITE LIKE THIS.
IN THE CENTER OF THIS CITY, IT IS THE HEART OF PARIS. THEY HAVE COMPLETELY SHUT IT DOWN. ALL OF THE MAJOR STREETS, THERE'S AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF
LAW ENFORCEMENT, MILITARY PRESENCE, WHERE WE ARE RIGHT HERE IS BY THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE. THERE IS A TEAM SET UP WITH
RIFLES AND VARIOUS CAMERAS. THEY HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE STREET AS WELL. IT REALLY IS REMARKABLE. THEY HAVE SHUT THE CITY DOWN.
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN TODAY IS THE OPENING CEREMONY WITHOUT ANY INCIDENT SO FAR. >> TOM, THE AUTHORITIES I
UNDERSTAND ARE JUST WRITING THIS AS AN ARSON ATTACK. DO WE HAVE ANY NDICATION OF WHO IS BEHIND IT? >> GARRETT, NOT ONLY ARSON, BUT
THE SIGNAL SYSTEM, THE CONTROL SYSTEM FOR FRANCE -- [ INAUDIBLE ]
>> TOM, I'M GOING TO PAUSE YOU FOR A SECOND BECAUSE WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH OUR MICROPHONE. STEPHANIE, YOU GET TO DO THE FUN STUFF HERE.
TELL ME ABOUT THE OPENING CEREMONY, WHAT WE SAW, WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE THIS WEEKEND.
>> YEAH, SURE. YOU KNOW, GARRETT, IT WAS AN AMBITIOUS IDEA RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE. TO HOLD AN OPENING CEREMONY OUTSIDE THE STADIUM AND ON THE
SENATE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT A STADIUM, IT HOLDS 79 OR 80,000 PEOPLE. THE IDEA IS TO GET AS MANY EYEBALLS LIVE ON THE GROUND TO
WATCH THIS AS POSSIBLE. WE HAVE UPWARDS OF 300,000 SPECTATORS ALONG THIS END. THE OTHER GREAT THING ABOUT IT IS THE ARTISTIC DIRECTOR HAS BEEN ABLE TO INVOLVE THESE
ICONIC PLACES ALONG THIS END THAT THE FLOATING PARADE HAS GONE BY AS PART OF THE SHOW. THERE WAS ONE MOMENT THERE WAS A SCENE THAT PLAYED OUT IN A
BUILDING CALLED THE CONCIERGE TREE, WHICH WAS WHERE MARIE ANTOINETTE WAS HELD IN THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. IT WAS A WILD SCENE WITH PYROTECHNICS AND A HEAVY METAL
BAND. IT WAS GREAT THE WAY THEY
INCORPORATED THE CITY INTO THE OPENING CEREMONY. IT'S ALSO BUT THEY HAVE DONE WITH THESE GAMES. A LOT OF THE VENUES ARE IN PLACES PEOPLE WOULD RECOGNIZE
IF THEY VISITED THE CITY. >> I'M EXCITED TO WATCH IT TONIGHT. DO WE HAVE TOM BACK NOW? ALL RIGHT. WE WILL GET TOM BACK IN JUST A
SECOND. TELL ME MORE ABOUT WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN BEHIND THIS ATTACK TODAY, AND WHAT STEPS WE WILL SEE TAKEN TO MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN THE GAMES?
ALL RIGHT. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE STILL GOING TO BE WITHOUT TOM FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SEGMENT. WE WILL TAKE A BREAK.
STEPHANIE, TOM, THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING OR ATTEMPTED REPORTING, TOM. REMEMBER, NBC NIGHTLY NEWS WITH LESTER HOLT WILL BE LIVE FROM PARIS TONIGHT IN ALL THROUGHOUT
THE GAMES. YOU CAN STREAM EVERY MORNING WITH THE OLYMPICS ON PEACOCK. ALL OF THIS STARTS WITH THE PRIME TIME
SUPPLY. >> WE HAVE NEWS ABOUT YOUR MONEY. >> MENTAL HEALTH. >> WHY IS IT SO TOUGH RIGHT NOW? >> NEWS FOR THE GENERATION OF
Lawmakers grapple with partisan gridlock in Congress
NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW. â™ª >>> WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN? â™ª
>>> WELCOME BACK. WITH APOLOGIES TO THE FOLKS ON CAPITOL HILL WHO I COVER WHEN I AM WEARING ONE OF MY OTHER HATS ON NBC, IT IS SILLY SEASON IN
CONGRESS. HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME, TIMES
SPENT ON SHOW VOTES LIKE WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY WITH LAWMAKERS PASSING A RESOLUTION CONDEMNING VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS FOR FAILING TO SECURE THE SOUTHERN BORDER.
AS FOLKS ON THE HILL HEAD BACK
FOR THE SUMMER RECESS, AND WE WISH THEM WELL, ALBEIT WITH LITTLE TO SHOW FOR THEIR WORK, A GROUP OF YOUNG STATE LEGISLATURES ARE COMPETING IN
WASHINGTON FOR AN ANNUAL SUMMIT AIMED AT DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS BACK HOME. JOINING ME NOW ARE TWO OF THE LAWMAKERS, STATE REPRESENTATIVE JASMINE CLARK OF GEORGIA, AND
REPUBLICAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL SMITH OF DELAWARE. REPRESENTED SMITH, WE SEE A LOT OF PARTISANSHIP IN MY DAY JOB ON CAPITOL HILL. HOW MUCH DO YOU SEE THE SAME
KIND OF SUMMONS IN THE STATE HOUSE IN DELAWARE? >> I THINK YOU CAN SEE IT A LOT. A LOT OF THE POLITICS IS STARTING TO PENETRATE, LOCALLY.
THAT'S WHERE I THINK EACH OF US HAS OUR ROLE TO DO TO CHANGE THAT. I APPRECIATE FUTURE CAUCUS ALWAYS TRYING TO CONVENE US TO
LEVEL SET THAT AND PUT SOME BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS INTO EACH STATE HOUSE. >> PART OF THE REASON YOU ARE HERE, YOU HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BROKEN
THROUGH AND ACHIEVED THINGS IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. YOU FOUND NEW TECHNIQUES, NEW SOLUTIONS. WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING AT THE STATEHOUSE LEVEL THAT WORKS THERE?
AND PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK CAN BE APPLIED HERE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. >> AT THE STATE LEVEL, THERE ARE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO
COLLABORATE. ACTUALLY,WE ACTUALLY WANT TO
WORK TOGETHER. I KNOW THAT PROBABLY SOUNDS SURPRISING TO SOME PEOPLE. BUT THE TRUTH, ESPECIALLY IN GEORGIA AND OUR STATEHOUSE, WE ARE SO CLOSE TO A 50-50 HOUSE
THAT COLLABORATION IS A MOST REQUIRED TO GET THINGS DONE. >> I WAS GOING TO ASK ABOUT THAT. I'M CURIOUS OF WHAT YOU MAKE OF
IT IN DELAWARE. I HAVE COVERED SUPER MAJORITY STATES, SUPER MAJORITY DEMOCRAT OR SUPER TO MAJORITY REPUBLICAN, THOSE ARE MORE DYSFUNCTIONAL
THAN THE EVENLY DIVIDED STATEHOUSES. WHAT'S YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE IN DELAWARE? >> I WOULD SAY YOU ARE CORRECT IN THAT REGARD. WE ARE TWO SEATS AWAY FROM A
SUPER MAJORITY IN DELAWARE. I THINK I WAS USED TO THE 80-20 RULE IN THE MINORITY. AND I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD GOVERN FROM A PLACE OF MINORITY
AT SOME POINT IN THEIR CAREER IF THEY WANT TO BE A GOOD LEGISLATOR. YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO GET UP AND GIVE UP 80 TO GET YOUR
PRIORITIES DONE IN THE 20%. GOVERNING IS DIFFERENT FROM CAMPAIGNING. PEOPLE HAVE TO LEAVE THAT AT THE DOOR. >> WHEN YOU SAY 80-20 IN WASHINGTON, THEY THINK YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT THE AGE OF LEGISLATORS. WE HAVE ALL THE SENATE AND HOUSE
. THE AVERAGE AGE IN THE SENATE IS 64, THE HOUSE IS 58. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO GET YOUNGER VOICES IN STATE LEGISLATIVE BODIES LIKE THE
ONES YOU REPRESENT BUT ALSO IN CONGRESS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE? I WILL START WITH YOU. >> I THINK IT IS VITAL. ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE SEEING
RIGHT NOW IS THIS HUNGER OF YOUNGER GENERATIONS SAYING, WE WANT TO SEE OURSELVES REPRESENTED IN GOVERNMENT AT
ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. SO, SOME STATEHOUSES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY ARE A LOT YOUNGER THAN WHAT WE SEE IN CONGRESS. BUT I ALSO THINK THERE IS AN
URGE TO HAVE A YOUNGER CONGRESS AS WELL. AND AS WE HAVE SEEN THIS WEEK, THERE'S ALSO AN URGE TO HAVE A
YOUNGER EXECUTIVE BRANCH. >> IT LOOKS THAT WAY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF THE AISLE. I GO, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT QUESTION? HOW DO YOU ENCOURAGE BRIGHT,
CAPABLE, YOUNGER PEOPLE TO WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS AT A LEVEL WHERE YOU ARE NOT GETTING RICH OR FAMOUS? >> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
SHARE TO PEOPLE ON THE
LEADERSHIP SIDE OF THINGS. WE ARE CALLED TO DO MORE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS IS A WAY YOU CAN STEP UP TO DO THAT. YEAH, WE DEFINITELY NEED MORE
YOUNG VOICES IN OUR STATE GOVERNMENT, DEFINITELY IN OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THAT IS A HARD VALUE PROPOSITION FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED TO PAY BILLS OR TAKE CARE OF
LOVED ONES, WHATEVER IT MAY BE. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE GREATER GOOD. WHAT CAN YOU BRING TO THE TABLE? THERE'S A CONSTANT CLASH
WHETHER IT IS CORPORATE AMERICA
OR IN GOVERNMENT, WHEN IS IT TIME TO GO AND LET THE NEXT GENERATION TAKE OVER, OR LET THEM HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE?
>> YOU REPRESENT A BATTLEGROUND STATE. SO, YOU GET THE BONUS QUESTION. ON A NATIONAL POLITICAL LEVEL, I AM CURIOUS WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN RESPONSE TO THE
CHANGE OF THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET IN GEORGIA. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD MY INTERVIEW WITH REPRESENTATIVE CLYBURN, HE THINKS GEORGIA IS COMPETITIVE AND MORE LIKELY TO
BE IN PLAY FOR DEMOCRATS WITH THE NEW TICKET COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS TICKET. >> I WILL SAY THERE IS DEFINITELY A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM.
I DO FEEL LIKE WE GOT A JOLT OF ENERGY, MAYBE A LITTLE CAFFEINATED AND GOING ON ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. BUT EITHER WAY, I DO THINK THAT
THE RECENT NEWS ABOUT JOE BIDEN ENDORSING VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS,
I DO THINK THAT HAS DEFINITELY CHANGED THINGS. THERE IS A NEW ENERGY IN THE AIR IN GEORGIA. >> WE LEAVE IT THERE FOR NOW.
JASMINE CLARK AND MIKE SMITH FROM GEORGIA AND DELAWARE, THINK YOU FOR COMING IN. AND AFTER SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, TOM TOOK THE
MICROPHONE OUT, BLEW ON IT AND PUT IT BACK IN. HE IS BACK WITH THE LATEST ON THE ARSON ATTACK IN PARIS.
TOM, LET'S PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS ATTACK? >> I'M UNDERSTANDING BASED ON U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS
AND FRENCH OFFICIALS, THEY THINK THIS COULD BE EITHER AN ANARCHIST OR EXTREMIST LEFT
GROUP THAT COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. YOU CAN SEE THE DAMAGE IT DID TO THEIR NETWORK AS FAR AS THE HIGH-SPEED NETWORK THAT WENT
DOWN AS A RESULT OF THESE ARSON ATTACKS, CUTTING OF FIBER-OPTIC CABLES, SIGNAL ISSUES THAT
OCCURRED ACROSS THAT COUNTRY. AND BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE, IT IS MAKING IT DIFFICULT. IT IS A LARGE CRIME SCENE.
THEY HAVE TO GO PIECE BY PIECE.
THERE ARE CLAIMS ABOUT FOREIGN COUNTRY INVOLVEMENT IN THIS. WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING TO COOPERATE THAT AT THIS POINT. I WANT TO STRESS EVERYTHING I
HAVE SAID. IT IS STILL EARLY IN THIS INVESTIGATION. THINK OF ALL THE DIFFERENT SIGNALS THAT WERE IMPACTED WHEN FIRES OCCURRED OR LINES WERE CUT, CAMERAS THAT NEED TO BE
LOOKED AT, EVIDENCE GATHERED FROM THE SCENES. IT WOULD BE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE. WE SAW EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING WITH STEPHANIE, THE
PHYSICAL PRESENCE THAT THE POLICE HAVE. THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR CONFIRMED CREDIBLE PLOTS THAT HAVE BEEN INTERRUPTED JUST IN THE PAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS INCLUDING
TWO OF THEM THIS WEEK ACCORDING TO THE FRENCH INTERIOR MR. MINISTER. THAT UNDERSCORES ISSUES IN FRANCE AND HOW SERIOUS THEY ARE
TAKING IT. EVERYTHING FROM KIND OF -- ISIS
TO INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH RUSSIA THEY HAVE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. THEY ARE DEFINITELY ON GUARD FOR THIS. THEY HAD AN ISSUE TODAY. OBVIOUSLY, WE WILL TRACK IT
CLOSELY. >> IT'S THE BIGGEST EVENT IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF FOLKS COMING AND GOING. MY UNDERSTANDING IS, A LOT OF THE NETWORK OF HIGH-SPEED RAIL
WILL NOT BE BACK UP UNTIL
MONDAY. >> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THEY THINK IT WILL TAKE THE ENTIRE WEEKEND TO PIECE THINGS BACK TOGETHER AND GET THE TRAINS MOVING AGAIN. SO, THAT WILL BE A CHALLENGE.
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, MOST OF THE VENUES ARE IN PARIS OR THE GENERAL AREA AROUND PARIS. THERE ARE SOCCER STADIUMS LOCATED IN OTHER PARTS OF
FRANCE. AS FAR AS PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO
GET TO THOSE VENUES, THAT WILL BE A CHALLENGE, PERHAPS NOT SO MUCH THE ATHLETES BUT THE SPECTATORS. THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE. WE ARE REALLY ONLY TALKING
ABOUT THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF TWO- WEEK PLUS EVENTS. HOPEFULLY, THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH OF AN IMPACT HERE, GARRETT. IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO WATCH. OBVIOUSLY, IT CONTINUES TO DRAIN FRENCH LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES. THEY ARE FOCUSED
