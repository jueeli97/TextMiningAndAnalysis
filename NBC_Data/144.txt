Donald Trump spoke at the annual meeting
of the National Association of black
journalists and it was the same old
show the
divisiveness and the
disrespect and let me just
say the American people deserve better
the American people deserve
better the American people deserve serve
a leader who tells the
truth a leader who does not respond with
hostility and anger when confronted with
the
facts we deserve a leader who
understands that our differences do not
divide
us they are an essential source of our
strength so I say to Sigma gamma R
sority Incorporated
ours is a fight for the
future and it is a fight for Freedom
