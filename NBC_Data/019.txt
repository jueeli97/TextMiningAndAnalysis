THE NEWS CONTINUES WITH YASMIN IN FOR HALLIE JACKSON RIGHT NOW.
>>> TONIGHT, WE COME ON THE AIR WITH A SHOWDOWN AT THE WHITE HOUSE SO TO SPEAK WITH THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER RIGHT
NOW TAKING MEETINGS WITH THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS. WE'LL BREAK DOWN THE HIGH STAKES ON BOTH THE GLOBAL AND
THE POLITICAL STAGES AS WELL. PLUS NBC'S NEW FOCUS GROUP SITS DOWN ITH NIKKI HALEY'S ONE
TIME SUPPORTERS. WHERE THOSE VOTERS NOW STAND IN THE LIKELY TRUMP HARRIS MATCHUP. >>> THEN OUT WEST, THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE FLEEING FROM OUT OF CONTROL WILD FIRES. THE DANGEROUS SITUATION IN FIVE
STATES AS FIREFIGHTERS STRUGGLE TO PUT IT ALL OUT. >>> THEN WE GO DOWN TO THE BAHAMAS. THE GROWING MYSTERY AROUND THE
WOMAN WHO VANISHED FROM A YOGA
RETREAT. >>> AND AN EERIELY SIMILAR
Harris meets with Netanyahu at the White House
DISAPPEARANCE MORE THAN A DECADE AGO.
>>> HEY EVERYBODY, I'M YASMIN IN FOR HALLIE. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS
MEETING WITH ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BB NETANYAHU. WE EXPECT THEM TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE ANY MOMENT IN THE
ROOM YOU SEE HERE. WE WILL BRING IT TO YOU LIVE AS SOON AS THEY DO. THE PRESIDENT SPOKE WITH BB
NETANYAHU EARLIER AS RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
ISRAEL FROSTY WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION LOOKING TO LOCK
IN A CEASE FIRE DEAL. WHEN YOU LOOK AT HIS LEGACY AND OUTLINE WHAT HIS ADMINISTRATION
REALLY WANTS TO DO NEXT, WITH SO MUCH OF THE ATTENTION NOW ON
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. KAMALA HARRIS HITTING HER RIVALS HARD. SPEAKING TO A MAJOR TEACHER'S
UNION IN TEXAS. AND ALSO SAYING SHE IS READY TO DEBATE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHETHER HE WANTS TO OR
NOT. >> READY TO DEBATE DONALD TRUMP. I HAVE AGREED TO THE PREVIOUSLY AGREED UPON SEPTEMBER 10th
DEBATE. HE AGREED TO THAT PREVIOUSLY. NOW IT APPEARS HE IS BACK
PEDALING BUT I'M READY. THE VOTERS DESERVE TO SEE THIS DEBATE ON A DEBATE STAGE SO I'M
READY, LET'S GO. >> HARRIS NOW HAS LESS THAN TWO WEEKS TO PICK HER RUNNING MATE AND WE ARE JUST HEARING FROM
REPUBLICAN ALLIES OF DONALD TRUMP WHO SAY PENNSYLVANIA'S JOSH SHAPIRO AS A STRONG
CONTENDER. HARRIS' TEAM SENDING OUT AN EMAIL DESCRIBING DONALD TRUMP AS I'M QUOTING HERE OLD AND
QUITE WEIRD. TRUMP REFERRING TO HER AS IN HIS WORDS LUNATIC AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY AS THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE
TWO RIVALS ONLY GETS MORE AND
MORE AND MORE BRUTAL. MARK MURRAY IS HERE WITH NEW POLLING DATA. I WANT TO START WITH KELLY O.
AT THE WHITE HOUSE. I'M TALKING THROUGH ALL THINGS
HAPPENING. BB NETANYAHU HAS MET WITH THE PRESIDENT SO FAR. WE ARE AWAITING THEM TO MEET
TOGETHER AS WELL. WHAT DO WE KNOW? >> Reporter: WELL, THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DAY. BECAUSE THE U.S. RELATIONSHIP
WITH ISRAEL IS ALWAYS AN IMPERATIVE AND OVER THESE LAST MANY MONTHS, IT HAS BEEN FRONT
AND CENTER. AND THERE HAVE BEEN TENSIONS, THAT IS OBVIOUS. THERE WAS A CORDIAL SPIRIT IN
THE OVAL OFFICE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. IN THE WORDS THEY SHARED
PUBLICLY BEFORE REPORTERS, THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T REALLY PREVIEW THE MEETING. THERE WAS A LOT OF IMPORTANT STUFF TO TALK ABOUT.
AND NETANYAHU USED THE MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PRESIDENT'S LONG PUBLIC SERVICE.
AND TO PAY HIS RESPECTS IF YOU WILL. AND THAT IS PROBABLY IMPORTANT IN THIS MOMENT NOT ONLY BECAUSE
OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT WITH THE PRESIDENT CHOOSING TO BE A ONE TERM PRESIDENT AND
PASSING THE TORCH, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVITY THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS.
WHATS THE PRIME MINISTER IS TRYING TO HEDGE ALL OF HIS OPTIONS. DEALING WITH THE CURRENT
SITTING PRESIDENT. SPEAKING WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT WHO IS NOW THE CANDIDATE FOR DEMOCRATS AND HE WILL BE GOING OFF TO MAR-A-LAGO
TO SPEAK WITH DONALD TRUMP. TRYING TO COVER ALL THE POTENTIAL LEADERSHIP SPOTS HE
HAS TO TOUCH. ISRAEL NEEDS TO GET IT DONE IN TERMS OF AGREEING TO A CEASE FIRE TO TRY TO GET THE SECURE
RELEASE OF THOSE HOSTAGES THAT
ARE ALIVE TRYING TO GET TO A POINT OF SOME STABILITY IN THE
AREA. THAT IS PART OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING. THE VICE PRESIDENT'S MEETING IS
SEPARATE. IT REFLECTS HER SCHEDULE BEING IN TEXAS EARLIER. BUT IT TAKES ON EXTRA PROPORTION AS SHE IS STEPPING
FORWARD AS THE LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR DEMOCRATS AND NOW A CANDIDATE IN THE WAY SHE IS HANDLING ALL OF THIS.
SO THE ATTENTION ON THIS MEETING HAS CERTAINLY RAMPED
UP. >> I WANT YOU TO TALK ABOUT THE LEGACY OF PRESIDENT BIDEN HERE AND NEGOTIATING AND TRYING TO STRIKE A DEAL BETWEEN HAMAS AND
PRIME MINISTER BB NETANYAHU IN ISRAEL SO TO SPEAK.
AND ALSO, THE POINT OF WHICH PRESIDENT BIDEN IS NEGOTIATING FROM. HE IS NOT RUNNING FOR
REELECTION. BUT HE IS NEGOTIATING FROM A LAME DUCK POSITION. DOES THAT PUT HIM AT A
DISADVANTAGE? >> CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO PUSH OFF THE TERM LAME
DUCK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THE REALITY IS HE IS IN OFFICE THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS AND THAT GIVES HIM THE POWER TO
USE. AND HE HAS BEEN PROVIDING ISRAEL WILL A LOT OF MUNITIONS
AND AND SUPPORT. HE STILL HAS CREDIBILITY AND STILL HAS CERTAINLY THE LEVERAGE OF POWER HE CAN USE. AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS
IMPORTANT FOR THE PRESIDENT TO WANT TO SEE THIS WOUND DOWN AND A RESOLUTION DURING HIS TIME IN
OFFICE TO FOCUS ON HIS FOREIGN
POLICY EXPERIENCE. SOMETHING HE HAS REFLECTED ON MANY TIMES. WE HAVE SEEN HOW IT HAS COST HIM POLITICALLY OVER THE MONTHS
WHEN HE WAS STILL THE ACTIVE
CANDIDATE. >> THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. >>> WANT TO GO TO THE LATEST WITH THE HARRIS CAMP. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS
MEETING WE ARE WAITING TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THE VICE PRESIDENT AND PRIME MINISTER
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS CONSIDERING SHE
IS TAKING THE POTENTIAL NOMINEE POSITION SHE IS TAKING. I SAT DOWN WITH MANY ARAB
VOTERS OUT OF MICHIGAN. THE MAJOR REASON WAS BECAUSE OF
HIS STANCE. THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN MORE HARD LINE ON HER POSITIONING WHEN IT COMES TO ISRAEL AND GAZA AND MORE
OUTSPOKEN WHEN CALLING FOR A CEASE FIRE FOR INSTANCE. HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS MEETING
THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE HAVING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER HERE AND WHAT DOES HER CAMP EXPECT
TO TAKE FROM IT? >> Reporter: WELL IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND HARRIS ALLIES HOPE SHE IS APPEAL TO SOME
VOTERS WHO WERE UNCOMMITTED TO BIDEN BECAUSE OF HIS STANCE THOUGH SHE IS VERY MUCH A PART OF THE CURRENT MIDDLE EAST
POLICIES AND THE BIDEN HARRIS EMPHASIS ON THE HARRIS
ADMINISTRATION. HARRIS HAS BEEN SEEN AS MORE SYMPATHETIC TO THE CIVILIAN DEATH TOLL, SPEAKING IN SELMA,
ALABAMA IN MARCH. AT THE TIME SHE SAID WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN GAZA WAS CLEARLY A
HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE AND AND IMMEDIATE SIX-WEEK CEASE FIRE WAS NEEDED SO THAT GOT A
LOT OF ATTENTION. HER SPEECH HAD TO BE WATERED DOWN BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GO FURTHER AND THE WHITE HOUSE PULLED THAT BACK. THIS WILL REALLY BE I THINK AN
ISSUE WHERE SHE WILL MAYBE TRY TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DAYLIGHT FROM THE PRESIDENT
JUST TALKING TO PEOPLE AROUND HER BUT NOT HER ACTUAL CAMPAIGN. HER CAMPAIGN IS SAYING SHE WAS
ON BOARD WITH WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS DOING. THEY WERE A TEAM TOGETHER. >> NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
CAMPAIGN. SHE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY BUSY ON
THAT. PUTTING A LETTER TOGETHER. ENDORSING THE CE PRESIDENT. WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US? >> MY COLLEAGUE RYAN RILEY AND
I OBTAINED THIS LETTER. MORE THAN 40 FORMER JUSTICE APARTMENT OFFICIALS WHO SERVED
UNDER REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ENDORSED VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS. THEY WRITE THE QUOTE FABRIC OF
THE NATION, THE RULE OF LAW AND DEMOCRACY ARE AT STAKE.
THEY CALL FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP A GRAVE RISK TO OUR COUNTRY. >> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
GEORGIA. AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT STATE. IT WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN 2020. I KNOW THE VICE PRESIDENT IS
TRAVELING THERE NEXT WEEK. HOW WILL THEY FOCUS IN ON GEORGIA VOTERS? >> THIS PLANE IS SORT OF BEING
BUILT IN MIDAIR. YEAH. >> YOU MAY STANDBY FOR A SECOND. WE ARE SEEING THE VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS SHAKING HANDS
WITH PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. LET'S OPEN UP THE MICS AND TAKE
A LISTEN.
>> SO, I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO KIND OF PUT CONTEXT TO WHAT
WE ARE SEEING HERE. AND GIVE FOLKS A VIEW OF WHERE THEY ARE. THIS IS THE CEREMONIAL OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT WHERE SHE
IS MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. AS WE SPOKE A LITTLERRIER, I WAS COVERING THE DAY IN WHICH
SHE SPOKE IN SELMA, ALABAMA. AND SHE MADE THAT SOMEWHAT
FIERY SPEECH AND IT WOULD SEEM LIKE THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CALLED FOR SOMEONE AS YOU SAID
CEASE FIRE FOR SIX WEEKS OR SO. IT WAS THE REAL MOMENT FOR THE
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. SEEMED LIKE A BIT OF A POLICY CHANGE. WHAT IS THE VICE PRESIDENT
GOING TO COVER HERE? WITH THE PRIME MINISTER TO GET HER POINT ACROSS?
CONSIDERING THAT SHE IS NOW RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND SHE COULD BE
TAKING ON COME NOVEMBER? >> AT THE TIME SHE WAS CALLING FOR THE SIX WEEK IMMEDIATE
CEASE FIRE, HER OFFICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE WERE SAYING SAY ARE BOTH
SAYING THE SAME THING. YOU CAN SEE HERE WHERE SHE HAS A SORT OF OPPORTUNITY TO MAYBE
CHART HER OWN COURSE. NOW THAT SHE WILL BE THE LIKELY DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HERE.
IN SOME WAYS YOU CAN SEE HER OFFICE TRYING TO TAKE THAT ROLE. SHE WAS GOING TO SAY SHE WANTED TO SEE AN ND TO THE WAR.
AND SHE UNDERSTOOD THAT ISRAEL SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF. THAT CIVILIANS AND PALESTINE ALSO NEEDED TO STOP BEING
KILLED AND ALSO THAT AT THE END OF THIS, AT THE END OF THIS WAR, PALESTINE SHOULD HAVE ITS
RIGHT, ITS DIGNITY. SO THAT IS THE WORDING AND MESSAGING COMING OUT OF HER OFFICE TODAY. SHE IS TRYING TO BE AHEAD OF
STATE. SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT. >> WE CANNOT OVERSTATE THIS. WE WILL TALK TO MARK MURRAY IN
A MOMENT. HOW CONSEQUENTIAL FOR KAMALA HARRIS THIS IS VERSUS HOW IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A WEEK AGO.
KNOWING ALL THE EYES THAT ARE ON HER BECAUSE GAZA, THE WAR
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND GAZA WAS SO, IT WILL BE AN UPHILL BATTLE.
>> IT IS INTERESTING AS SOON AS THIS NEWS BROKE THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS STEPPING DOWN AND SHE WAS GOING TO BE ENDORSED BY
HIM. I STARTED GETTING EMAILS. BECAUSE I HAD BEEN DOING REPORTING. ONE OF THE EMAILS I GOT WAS THE
HEAD OF THE UNCOMMITTED MOVEMENT. THE MOVEMENT OF MUSLIM AND ARAB
VOTERS SAYING THEY SHOULD BE VOTING UNCOMMITED IN THE PRIMARIES AND REALLY BE UNDECIDED RIGHT NOW IN THE
ELECTION. NOW OF COURSE, HARRIS IS STEPPING INTO THE ROLE. THE FIRST THING THEY ARE SAYING
IS HARRIS CAN EARN OUR VOTE IF SHE TAKES CERTAIN POLICY POSITIONS, CALLING FOR THE END OF CIVILIAN DEATHS IN GAZA.
SO THEY ARE HOPING SHE CAN CHANGE AND GET THEIR SUPPORT IN A WAY IT IS REALLY INTERESTING.
THE INTERESTING THING HERE, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP ISN'T BETTER ON THIS POLICY THAN SHE
WAS. SO THERE IS THIS CATCH 22 WHERE SHE IS GOING TO TRY TO APPEAL TO THESE VOTERS BUT THEY HAVE A
HARD CHOICE TO MAKE. >> THAT IS SUCH A GOOD POINT. DO THEY STAY HOME, DO THEY NOT VOTE AT ALL, OR DO THEY PULL
THE LEVER FOR KAMALA HARRIS? WHEN IT SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE LEANING ON THE DIRECTION OF SITTING IT OUT NO MATTER WHAT
AND THAT WILL COME INTO QUESTION THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. WHERE ARE WE ON VEEP STAKES? >> WELL, WHERE WE ARE IS THAT
PEOPLE ARE SORT OF GOING AND HAVING INTERVIEWS. THERE IS A LIST STILL COMING
TOGETHER. I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE GOING TO PLAY THE SOUND OF SOME OF THE THE CANDIDATES IF YOU WANT TO
TAKE A LISTEN. >> I'M HONORED TO BE CONSIDERED AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT COMES
NEXT, I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VICE
PRESIDENT BECOMES OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. >> SHE IS GOING TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE, I JUST WANT HER TO CHOOSE THE PERSON THAT GIVES
HER THE BEST CHANCE TO WIN. >> SO I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO A NUMBER OF SOURCES WHO WERE
FAMILIAR WITH THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN POINTING OUT THAT GOVERNOR ROY COOPER OF NORTH
CAROLINA, GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO OF PENNSYLVANIA AND SENATOR MARK KELLY OF ARIZONA ARE
CONTENDERS. BUT THE LIST IS LONG. THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE
DECISION QUICKLY. THEY CAN ASSURE HARRIS MAKES IT ON THE BALLOT IN ALL 50 STATES.
New poll shows Harris narrowing gap against Trump
>> TWO WEEKS OR SO. WOW. THANK YOU. APPRECIATE IT. >>> WE BETTER TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THE POLLING. MARK MURRAY WILL WALK US THROUGH THE POLLS COMING OUT.
YOUNG VOTERS ESPECIALLY. I KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE NEW POLLING WE ARE SEEING FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES. ALL THIS IN A MARGIN OF ERROR.
WALK US THROUGH THE NUMBERS WE ARE SEEING WITH A TRUMP V
HARRIS ELECTION. >> YEAH. THE NEW YORK TIMES CAME OUT WITH BRAND NEW NATIONAL POLL TODAY AFTER JOE BIDEN'S EXIT
FROM THE RACE. AND IT SHOWS A REALLY
COMPETITIVE CONTEST WITH LIKELY VOTERS. DONALD TRUMP WITH A ONE-POINT LEAD OVER HARRIS.
WELL WITHIN THE MARGIN OF
ERROR. SIGNIFICANTLY, THIS IS A MUCH SMALLER LEAD FOR BIDEN THAN
EXISTED RIGHT AFTER THAT DISASTROUS DEBATE PERFORMANCE. TRUMP HAD A MUCH LARGER LEAD
THAN HE HAS RIGHT NOW. AND WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT IS AT LEAST IN THIS POLL, THIS RACE IS KIND OF GONE BACK TO WHERE
THE RACE WAS BACK IN APRIL. WITH TRUMP WITH THE ONE TO TWO
POINT LEAD. I EMPHASIZE THIS IS A VERY COMPETITIVE RACE. POLLS CAN KIND OF JUMP ALL THE
WAY AROUND. BUT RIGHT NOW IN THE TOTALITY OF ALL THE POLLS WE HAVE SEEN SINCE BIDEN'S EXIT, THIS IS A
VERY CLOSE CONTEST. >> HOW MUCH DO YOU CHALK THIS UP TO NEW EXCITEMENT OVER
KAMALA HARRIS VERSUS LASTING SUPPORT? >> AT LEAST IN THIS ONE POLL THERE IS EXCITEMENT AND UNITY AROUND HARRIS. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS COME
BACK IN THE FOLD. THERE HAD BEEN SOME PREVIOUS DEMOCRATIC HOLD-OUTS WHEN BIDEN
WAS STILL IN THE RACE. THAT DOESN'T EXIST NOW. AND THE YOUNG VOTERS.
YOUNG VOTERS HAVE SNAPPED BACK TO SUPPORTING HARRIS. THAT WASN'T ALL THAT MUCH
SUPPORT WHEN IT CAME TO JOE BIDEN. DONALD TRUMP NOW HAS A LITTLE
MORE WITH SENIORS. FOR EVERY ACTION THERE IS A REACTION. >> WHERE ARE WE LANDING WITH PREVIOUS NIKKI HALEY VOTERS?
>> THIS IS FASCINATING. WE HAD A FOCUS GROUP OF 14
FOCUS GROUP MEMBERS WHO VOTED FOR NIKKI HALEY IN THE PRIMARY SEASON. THREE ARE VOTING FOR KAMALA
HARRIS THEY ENDED UP SAYING. BUT THEY WERE CLEAR BIDEN
VOTERS BEFORE THIS AND THE REST OF THEM, HALF ARE VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP. HALF ARE VOTING FOR THIRD PARTY
OR NOT VOTING AT ALL. WHAT IS FASCINATING, MOST OF THEM HAD SOME NICE THING TO SAY
ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS. BUT THEY ALSO SAID THEY WANT TO HEAR A LOT MORE ABOUT HER.
AND THAT IS THE BATTLE FOR HER TO DEFINE HERSELF IS ONE OF THE
Wildfires across the West force thousands to evacuate
BIG OCTAVES. >> MARK MURRAY, THANK YOU. >>> THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE FORCED TO EVACUATE THEIR HOMES AS WILD
FIRES BURN OUT OF CONTROL OUT WEST. HUNDREDS OF BLAZES IN WASHINGTON, OREGON, IDAHO,
CALIFORNIA. THE SITUATION THERE BECOMING
MORE AND MORE DANGEROUS. THAT EXPLOSION CAUGHT ON CAMERA
IN UTE COUNTY. IT HAS DESTROYED HOMES, MORE BUILDINGS ARE AT RISK. A MAN IS ARRESTED WHO IS
SUSPECTED OF STARTING THAT FIRE. IN OREGON, THE GOVERNOR CALLING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD FOR HELP
AS FIRES THERE REACH MEGAFIRE STATUS. AT LEAST 100,000 ACRES EACH.
THE JERSEY FIRE ALONE BURNING 270,000 ACRES CAUSING CLOSURES OF THE I-84 CORRIDOR.
NOW LIGHTNING STORMS ARE MAKING IT EVEN TOUGHER FOR FIREFIGHTER
TO DO THEIR JOBS. DAVID, START FOR US IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT
FIREFIGHTERS ARE UP AGAINST THERE. >> THE PARK FIRE IS UP NEAR
CHUCO. THE OUTER EDGE OF THE FIRE IS ONLY ABOUT A MILE AWAY FROM THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE CITY. THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE FIRE
STARTED IN A PARK. AND BIG URBAN WILDERNESS PARK THAT IS JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY.
YOU MENTIONED THE BUTTE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAYS THEY HAVE A 42-YEAR-OLD MAN AS YET
UNNAMED IN CUSTODY WHO WAS ALLEGEDLY WITNESSED PUSHING A CAR ON FIRE INTO A GULLEY IN
THAT PARK. THAT IS WHAT IS SUSPECTED TO HAVE STARTED THAT FIRE. IT WAS AN INSTANCE OF ALLEGED
ARSON THAT THIS FIRE IS SO CLOSE TO MAJOR POPULATION CENTERS. ABOUT 4,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
ORDERED EVACUATED. AS THE AUTHORITIES UP THERE IN BUTTE TOWNTY SAY THEY ARE THROWING EVERYTHING THEY HAVE AT THIS FIRE AND IT IS STILL
NOT ENOUGH. THEY ARE DRAWING IN RESOURCES FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WATCHING
THIS FIRE. >> AND UP NORTH, YOU HAVE THE MEGAFIRES IN OREGON, WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE?
>> Reporter: YEAH. SO THE FIRE YOU MENTIONED, THE
ACREAGE IS ABOUT 400 SQUARE MILES. THE ENTIRE CITY OF NEW YORK IS ABOUT 300 SQUARE MILES. SO FIREFIGHTERS UP THERE ARE
REALLY STRUGGLING TO CONTAIN THAT. TALKING ABOUT CONTAINING THE FIRE, PHYSICALLY CONTAINING THE PERIMETER OF THE FIRE BY DOING
SUCH THINGS AS DIGGING DITCHES WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH A MEGAFIRE OF THAT SHEER SIZE,
THAT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO DO WHEN THE WEATHER IS WORKING
AGAINST YOU. THUNDERSTORMS. THERE WAS RAIN OVERNIGHT AND INTO TODAY. BUT NOT ENOUGH TO PUT THAT FIRE
OUT OR REALLY MAKE ANY MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN CONTAINING IT. >> DAVID, THANK YOU.
Former Uvalde school officer pleads not guilty to charges
>>> TO UVALDE, TEXAS NOW WHERE A FORMER POLICE OFFICER IS PLEADING NOT GUILTY TO CHARGES
HE FAILED TO PROTECT 19 CHILDREN AND TWO TEACHERS
KILLED IN THE SHOOTING. SOME OF THE VICTIMS AND LOVED ONES ANGRILY CONFRONTING THE
OFFICER AS HE LEFT COURT. >> LOOK AT US.
SAY SOMETHING. SAY SOMETHING TO US. SAY SOMETHING. YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY SORRY TO US.
>> THAT MAN'S NAME, ADRIAN GONZALEZ FACING 29 COUNTS OF CHILD ENDANGERMENT. ONE OF THE FIRST OFFICERS ON THE SCENE THAT DAY.
THE INDICTMENT SAYS HE QUOTE FAILED TO ENGAGE, DISTRACT, OR
DELAY THE SHOOTER. NEARLY 400 OFFICERS RESPONDED TO THAT SHOOTING INCLUDING THE POLICE CHIEF WHO ALSO FACES
CHARGES BUT THEY WAITED MORE THAN 70 MINUTES TO GO INTO A CLASSROOM UNTIL THE ATTACKER WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER, 21
PEOPLE, MOSTLY NINE AND TEN- YEAR-OLDS ALONG WITH TWO TEACHERS, THEY WERE ALL DEAD. YOU CAN SEE THEIR NAMES AND
THEIR FACES HERE. GUAD VENEGAS IS OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE FOR US IN UVALDE TO
TALK MORE ABOUT THIS. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS MOMENT. I WAS DOWN IN UVALDE WHEN THIS
MASS SHOOTING HAPPENED. THE FAMILY, THAT TOWN, THE STATE, TORN APART OVER THIS. ESPECIALLY OVER THE 70 MINUTES
IN WHICH OFFICERS WAITED OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOMS AND DID NOT GO IN AND ENGAGE THAT
SHOOTER. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS MOMENT
FOR THOSE FAMILIES? >> Reporter: ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WAS THE LACK OF INFORMATION WHEN THIS HAPPENED. AUTHORITIES WERE NOT
COMMUNICATING EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. SO OVER TIME, IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT PROCESS FOR FAMILY
MEMBERS. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED AND WHO WAS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DELAYED RESPONSE. YOU HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WAITING FOR A LONG TIME FOR INVESTIGATIONS TO TAKE PLACE.
AND FOR CHARGES TO COME UP. WE HAVE TWO OFFICERS. THE OFFICERS PART OF THAT
SCHOOL DISTRICT POLICE, THE POLICE AGENCY TO RESPOND NOW
FACING CHARGES. FORMER POLICE CHIEF PETE ARREDONDO. AND ADRIAN GONZALEZ ARRIVING IN COURT. HALF OF THE PEOPLE IN COURT
TODAY WERE FAMILY MEMBERS THERE TO REPRESENT THE VICTIMS.
LET'S HEAR FROM THE FATHER OF
ONE OF THE VICTIMS. >> THERE IS A LOT OF ANGER. IF YOU TAKE OFF THE WRONG,.
>> DIDN'T STOP HIM AT ALL.
>> HE WAS SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT TWO OFFICERS HAVE BEEN
INDICTED. ADRIAN GONZALEZ PLEADED NOT
GUILTY >> CAN YOU TALK QUICKLY IN
THERE WAS DPS. WE SAW THE VIDEO. WE SAW THE TAPE THE CHILDREN
WERE COWERING INSIDE WITH THAT SCHOOL SHOOTER. WHAT LEGAL FALL-OUT COULD WE SEE AND HOW QUICKLY COULD WE
SEE IT? >> SO WE KNOW THE GRAND JURY BROUGHT THESE INDICTMENTS
AGAINST THESE TWO OFFICERS. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD A REPORT INDICATING THERE WERE
MULTIPLE FAILURES OF THE AGENCIES THAT RESPONDED THAT DAY. WE HAVE SEEN THESE CHARGES AGAINST THE TWO OFFICERS BUT THERE HAS BEEN LEGAL ACTION
TAKEN BY THE FAMILIES HERE IN UVALDE. DIFFERENT ONES. THERE WAS A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURED THE
RIFLE THAT WAS USED BY THE SHOOTER THAT DAY.
AND THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER LAWSUIT AGAINST META THAT OWNS
INSTAGRAM AND THE COMPANY THAT MADE CALL OF DUTY, ACT VISION BLIZZARD. THEY ACCUSED BOTH COMPANIES OF
BEING USED BY THE GUN MANUFACTURER TO PROMOTE THE GUN AND THAT IS HOW THE YOUNG MAN
THAT BOUGHT THE GUN AND USED THE GUN AT THE SHOOTING WAS ABLE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE
WEAPON. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY THERE, ALSO SUING SOME OF THOSE STATE TROOPERS. SO THAT IS LEGAL ACTION THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE FAMILIES.
AND WE ARE WAITING TO SEE IF MORE CHARGES WILL BE BROUGHT AGAINST ANY OTHER POLICE AGENCY THAT INVOLVED THE OFFICERS
RESPONDING THAT DAY. >> GUAD VENEGAS, THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE.
NASA gives update on strainer capsule’s return
I APPRECIATE IT. >>> NASA SAYS TWO OF ITS ASTRONAUTS IN SPACE 50 DAYS AND COUNTING WILL HAVE TO WAIT A
LITTLE LONGER BEFORE THEY CAN COME HOME SAYING NO OFFICIAL DATE TO BRING THEM BACK. THE SPACE AGENCY SAYING THEY
STILL NEED TO FINISH DOING SOME TESTS ON THE GROUND BEFORE THEY
GIVE THEIR ASTRONAUTS TO GO I A
HEAD TO COME HOME. NASA SAYS IT IS BECAUSE OF ISSUES WITH THE THRUSTERS ON THE CAPSULE.
IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THEY HAVE BACKUP PLANS, TWO PEOPLE
YOU ARE SEEING HERE HOME. THEY WERE HOPING TO BRING THE ASTRONAUTS BACK AND FORTH FROM THE SPACE STATION FOR YEARS TO
COME. I WANT TO BRING IN JESSE KIRSCH WHO HAS BEEN FOLLOWING ALL OF
THIS FOR US. WHAT IS HOLDING NASA BACK HERE?
>> Reporter: OFFICIALS TELL US THEY HAVE COMPLETED GROUND TESTING BUT WANT TO DO MORE
TESTING IN SPACE. WE ARE EXPECTING THAT THIS WEEKEND. NASA WANTS TO CONDUCT AN AGENCY
REVIEW THAT COULD HAPPEN AS SOON AS LATE NEXT WEEK.
WE TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS HAPPENING BEFORE THE CREW IS
READY TO BE SENT BACK. WE ARE LOOKING AT ANOTHER WEEK. OFFICIALS HAVE STRESSED THAT
THEY BELIEVE THE CRAFT IS SAFE FOR THE CREW TO GET IN AND COME HOME. AND RIGHT NOW, IF THERE WERE AN
EMERGENCY. SO THIS IS ABOUT THEM CHECKING ALL THEIR BOXES AND GOING THROUGH ALL OF THE RESEARCH THEY WANT TO DO ON THIS WHILE
IT IS STILL UP THERE. >> ALL THIS SAID, THEY SAID THEY HAD A BACK UP PLAN. IF IN FACT THEY CAN'T COME BACK
ON THE STAR LINER. IS THERE A LIMIT SO WHICH THESE ASTRONAUTS CAN REMAIN AT THE
SPACE STATION? >> YEAH. SO, OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THEY HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN BUT WOULDN'T GO INTO MUCH DETAIL
ABOUT WHAT THAT IS. THEY SAID THE PLAN IS STILL TO GET THEM HOME ON STAR LINER. THEY WEREN'T CONCERNED ABOUT
ANY CLOTHING OR FOOD SHORTAGES BUT WE KNOW THE ASTRONAUTS HAVE BEEN BORROWING CLOTHING FROM OTHER CREW MEMBERS ON THE ISS
BECAUSE THEY LEFT THEIR LUGGAGE AT HOME TO MAKE ROOM FOR TOILET EQUIPMENT BEFORE TAKEOFF.
YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP. HERE IS WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT
THE OP GOING SITUATION. >> RIGHT NOW, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TEAR DOWN OF THE
THRUSTER SO WE HAVE, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FUEL ON THE FUEL
VALVE. WE ARE FOLLOWING THE DATA AND WILL SCHEDULE THAT REVIEW WHEN WE NEED TO. AND THEN AFTER THAT, WE WILL
SET THE TIME. >> Reporter: SO THAT IS WHAT OFFICIALS ARE WORKING THROUGH NOW. AND WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE LIME TINE,
OFFICIALS SAID THEY HAVE EXPANDED THE TIME LINE OF THE BATTERIES FOR THE SPACECRAFT TO 90 DAYS FROM 45 DAYS SO THEY
HAVE MORE WIGGLE ROOM. >> I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME ANXIOUS FAMILY MEMBERS WANTING
TO SEE THE ASTRONAUTS TOUCH DOWN ON EARTH. JESSE KIRSCH, THANK YOU. >>> COMING UP, WE HAVE BIG
CHANGES AT SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. WHY IT IS GETTING RID OF SOMETHING THAT IS VERY FAMOUS FOR AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR
TRAVEL EVERIES LIKE YOU. PLUS AN ARREST AFTER A HOUSE WENT UP IN FLAMES IN
CONNECTICUT. WHY FIREFIGHTERS INTENTIONALLY BURNED IT DOWN.
GO TO COLLEGE. >> MORNING NEWS NOW.
Southwest Airlines ends open seating policy
>>> SOUTHWEST AIRLINES ANNOUNCING SOME MAJOR CHANGES TODAY. THE CARRIER SAYING THEY ARE ABANDONING THEIR FAMOUS OPEN
SEATING APPROACH. IN CASE YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT, THAT IS WHEN PASSENGERS RACE TO GET THE BEST
SEATS. AFTER 53 YEARS OF THIS, SOUTHWEST SAYS THEY WILL OFFER
PRESEATING AS SOON AS NEXT YEAR. I WANT TO BRING IN EMILIE
IKEDA. THIS IS WHAT SOUTHWEST HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. IT'S A HUGE CHANGE.
>> THE RUSH, THE MAD DASH. AND I THINK THIS SHIFT, LISTEN, PEOPLE ARE REALLY BIG FANS OF
SOUTHWEST, THEY ARE GOING TO POINT OUT, THE ACCESSIBILITY.
AFFORDABILITY. THE QUICK BOARDING PROCESS. AND THEIR FEAR IS BY MOVING AWAY FROM THAT, WILL ALWAYS MOVE AWAY FROM THOSE THINGS. WHEN WE LOSE THE OPEN SEATING
AND MOVE INTO THE ASSIGNED SEATING BUT THE CEO POINTS TO RESEARCH. THEY COLLECTED SOME 80% OF
THEIR CUSTOMERS SAY THEY PREFER AN ASSIGNED SEAT AND THEY SAY THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE NOT CHOOSING SOUTHWEST IS THE LACK OF
ASSIGNED SEATS. SO WE ARE HEARING A LITTLE BIT OF BACK AND FORTH FROM
CUSTOMERS, TAKE A LISTEN HERE. >> IT IS MORE CONVENIENT. SIT WHERE YOU WANT TO SIT. >> TYPICALLY, WHEN YOU HAVE
PEOPLE RUSHING THE SECTION ONE, TWO, YOU HAVE PEOPLE RUNNING IN FRONT OF YOU. IT IS NICE TO KNOW THAT YOUR
SEAT IS SECURE. >> THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PRESSURE ON SOUTHWEST. YOU LOOK AT THE Q2 NUMBERS.
THE PROFIT IS DOWN SOME 46% COMPARED TO LAST YEAR, SO THEY ARE FACING A LOT OF PRESSURE.
ESPECIALLY FROM INVESTORS. ALSO THEY ARE GOING TO BE
INTRODUCING PREMIER SEATING. DELTA, AMERICAN, THE DIFFERENCE IS A LOT OF THESE AIRLINES RIGHT NOW, ACROSS THE INDUSTRY,
THEY ARE EXPERIENCING OVER CAPACITY. DESPITE THE RECORD SUMMER
TRAVEL, THEY HAVE EXTOO SEATS RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE SO MANY EXTRA SEATS BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE
SOUTHWEST DOESN'T HAVE THE PREMIER SEATS, THEY ARE NOT SEEING THE LIST IN THEIR REVENUE. SO THEY ARE HOPING THIS WILL HELP DIG THEM OUT OF THAT
SCENARIO. >> I GET IT. BECAUSE I LIKE AN ASSIGNED SEAT. AND I WOULD HAVE SOME ANXIETY
ABOUT WHERE I WAS GOING TO END UP IF I GOT THERE TOO LATE.
>> IT IS A MAD DASH, A
SCRAMBLE. >> THERE IS DEFINITELY A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO LOVED IT AND WILL MISS IT. >>> ALL RIGHT, WANT TO GET YOU
TO THE FIVE THINGS OUR TEAM THINKS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. THE MISSOURI SUPREME COURT REPORT BLOCKING THE RELEASE OF
A MAN WHOSE CONVICTION WAS OVERTURNED AFTER THE AG'S
REQUEST FOR A STAY. CHRISTOPHER DUNN HAS BEEN INCARCERATED MORE THAN 30 YEARS FOR A MURDER HE SAYS HE DID NOT
COMMIT. HE WAS SET TO BE FREED LAST NIGHT AFTER A JUDGE ORDERED HIS RELEASE. HIS TEAM IS WORKING TO RESPOND
TO THE AG'S MOTION. U.S. AND CANADIAN FIGHTER JETS INTERCEPTS BOMBERS FLYING IN
INTERNATIONAL AIR SPACE NEAR ALASKA. ACCORDING TO THE NORTH AMERICAN AEROSPACE COMMAND, NORAD SAYS
THE BOMBERS DID NOT ENTER AMERICAN AIR SPACE AND WERE NOT SEEN AS A THREAT. DEFENSE OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL
CONTINUE MONITORING THE AREA.
NUMBER THREE, DISNEY PLUS, HULU ARE LAUNCHING STREAMING BUNDLES. AN AD FREE VERSION FOR ABOUT
$30 A MONTH. THE COMPANY SAYS IT WILL SAVE SUBSCRIBERS UP TO 38%.
>>> NUMBER FOUR, PRINCE HARRY SAYS HIS ONGOING FIGHT WITH
BRITISH ARE A MAJOR REASON FOR HIS RIFT. HE HAS FILED MULTIPLE LAWSUITS
AGAINST THE U.K. AND A JUDGE RULED HIS PHONE WAS
HACKED BY JOURNALISTS LOOKING. HI >>> AND BILLY JOEL, HIS CONCERT
WILL BE HIS 150th PERFORMANCE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN WRAPPING UP A RECORD BREAKING TEN YEAR RESIDENCY.
I SAW A SHOW THERE. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY AND IT WAS
INCREDIBLE. HIS SHOW. WHEN WE COME BACK, THE
DISAPPEARANCE OF ANOTHER AMERICAN AT A YOGA RETREAT IN THE BAHAMAS. >>> AND WHAT COULD BE THE MOST
AMBITIOUS OPENING CEREMONYOULDNE
Texas man disappeared from Bahamas resort a decade ago
THE CASE AS SERIOUSLY. WHERE THAT CASE STAND TODAY, POLICE FOUND TAYLOR'S PHONE IN THE OCEAN SEVERAL WEEKS AGO. THEY TOLD US THEY WERE NOT ABLE
TO RECOVER ANY SORT OF INFORMATION ON THAT PHONE. BUT WITH THIS NEW INFORMATION?
SOMEONE WENT MISSING, WE HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN WE DO ANSWERS.
>> THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. >>> NBC COVERED HUNDREDS OF
STORIES EACH DAY. AND BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH OR LISTEN TO ALL OF THEM, WE HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU.
THIS IS GOING DOWN IN A SEGMENT WE CALL THE LOCAL. FROM OUR NORTHEAST BUREAU, NEW YORK CITY OFFICIALS ARE GOING
TO START TESTING GUN DETECTERS IN SUBWAY STATIONS THIS WEEK. IT'S THE LATEST FIRST TO ADDRESS PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS.
OFFICIALS SAID THE DETECTION SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THE ONES YOU SEE IN AIRPORTS AND WILL BE
INSTALLED IN VARIOUS STATIONS AT ONE MONTH. ALSO FROM OUR NORTHEAST BUREAU, POLICE IN CONNECTICUT ARRESTING
A MAN AFTER FINDING FIREWORKS GOING OFF DURING A HOUSE FIRE, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TRIED TO PUT OUT THE FLAMES AND DECIDED
THE SAFEST THING TO DO WOULD BE TO INTENTIONALLY BURN THE HOME. SAFELY ELIMINATING THE RISK
FROM THE FIREWORKS. POLICE SAY THEY EVACUATED THE HOME IN THE AREA BEFORE THIS HAPPENED AND NO ONE WAS HURT. THE MAN IS FACING A FEW CHARGES
INCLUDING RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT. THEN FROM OUR WESTERN BUREAU, THE COAST GUARD ARRESTING A MAN FROM AN EMERGENCY RAFT OFF THE
COAST OF WASHINGTON. HE TRIED TO SIGNAL FOR HELP AFTER HIS BOAT STARTED TO TAKE ON WATER. EVENTUALLY HE WAS ABLE TO GET
ON A LIFE RAFT. HE APPARENTLY REFUSED MEDICAL TREATMENT. >>> COMING UP, IT STARTED AS A
GOSSIP PAGE. BUT NOW
The Shade Room could shape 2024 election
>>> IN TONIGHT'S ORIGINAL, A TOPIC WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON FOR A WHILE NOW. A MEDIA OUTLET WITH A HUGE
BLACK AUDIENCE THAT COULD BE HUGELY INFLUENTIAL.
IT STARTED AS A TMZ STYLE GOSSIP PAGE. BUT THE SHADE ROOM HAS BECOME
MASSIVELY POPULAR. BUT THE METEORIC GROWTH HAS NOT
BEEN WITHOUT CONTROVERSY. >> Reporter: THE SHADE ROOM. >> THINGS HAVE BEEN PRETTY QUIET LATELY.
>> Reporter: WHAT STARTED AS A CELEBRITY GOSSIP INSTAGRAM PAGE ROOTED IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY,
ONCE EVEN CALLED INSTAGRAM TMZ IS RAPIDLY TRANSFORMING INTO A
FULL-FLEDGED MEDIA COMPANY PUSHING INTO ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING. >> IT STARTED ON ACCIDENT I. WAS A DARE FROM ONE OF MY

IT IS IMPORTANT TO US. ALL OF OUR WRITERS HAVE TO HAVE
GENERALLISM DEGREES. WE ALSO HIRED A POLITICAL CONSULTING FIRM. ALL OF OUR POLITICAL POSTS ARE FILTERED THROUGH THAT.
>> Reporter: AS IT CONTINUES TO GROW AND WITH A HISTORIC ELECTION COMING UP IN NOVEMBER, THE SHADE ROOM OFFERS A UNIQUE
CONDUIT TO MANY BLACK VOTERS. ITS FOLLOWERS AND AUDIENCE CALLED ROOMIES HELP MAKE UP A
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT PROVED CRUCIAL TO BIDEN'S ELECTION IN 2020. ONE THAT NOW BOTH KAMALA HARRIS
AND DONALD TRUMP ARE AGGRESSIVELY COURTING. SUPPORT FOR BOTH BIDEN AND HARRIS HAD TRADITIONALLY BEEN
STRONG AMONG BLACK VOTERS BUT NBC'S LATEST POLLING SHOWING 32% OF THOSE VOTERS CURRENTLY
DISAPPROVING OF PRESIDENT BIDEN. THE SPOTLIGHT WILL TURN TO PLATFORMS LIKE THE SHADE ROOM
AND ITS MASSIVE AUDIENCE. >> EVEN JUST THE FACT WE ARE
PART OF THE PRESS POOL, IT SHOWS YOU THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF THE BLACK VOTE.
>> AND WE ASKED THE SHADE ROOM ABOUT HOW THEY WILL BE COVERING KAMALA HARRIS' CAMPAIGN NOW
THAT SHE HAS DECLARED. >> SWITCHING GEARS NOW.
>>> NO BARBENHEIMER THIS SUMMER. IT HAS BEEN A SLOW SEASON FOR
BLOCK BUSTERS SO FAR. BUT TONIGHT, PEOPLE ARE OUT FOR
THE NEW SUPERHERO MOVIE. DEADPOOL AND WOLVERINE COULD BE THE BIGGEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR, IT COULD MAKE OVER A BILLION
DOLLARS AT THE BOX OFFICE IN THE LONG RUN WITH AN EXPECTED
OPENING WEEKEND TALLY OVER $160 MILLION WOULD BE A RECORD FOR
AN R-RATED MOVIE. I GOT TO TELL YOU, AS I SCRAWL THROUGH MY INSTAGRAM FEED, OR ANY SOCIAL MEDIA THAT I HAVE ON
MY PHONE, ALL I SEE IS INTERVIEWERS WITH ESSENTIALLY
THE STARS OF THESE FILMS.
WHY ALL THE HYPE? >> THERE IS SO MUCH HYPE. FANS ARE CATCHING THE EARLY SCREENINGS AND I HAVE BEEN
TALKING TO ALL OF THEM AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE AN EDUCATION ON WOLVERINE AND DEADPOOL.
THE REASON THERE IS SO MUCH
HYPE, WE DID SEE THEM BEFORE TOGETHER IN 2009.
IN THE X-MEN FRANCHISE. THAT WAS UNDER 20th CENTURY STUDIOS. IF YOU REMEMBER A FEW YEARS
AGO, DISNEY ACQUIRED THAT BRINGING THESE CHARACTERS INTO THE MARVEL FOLD. CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE BANTER
BETWEEN RYAN REYNOLDS AND HUGH JACKMAN? THEY ARE FANS IN REAL LIFE. PEOPLE LOVE THEIR BANTER ON
SOCIAL MEDIA. TAYLOR SWIFT WEIGHING INTO THE CONVERSATION SAYING HOW MUCH RYAN REYNOLDS HAS POURs HIS HEART AND SOUL INTO THIS MOVIE
AND TO RUN, NOT WALK TO GO SEE THIS. IT IS ALSO, YASMIN, THE FIRST R-
RATED MOVIE FOR A MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE. SO THAT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. AND THE BOX OFFICE REALLY NEEDS
IT. THINGS GOT OFF TO A VERY SLOW START WITH FURIOSA. YOU SAW AN UP TICK WITH MOVIES
LIKE DESPICABLE ME 4. TWISTERS. OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT MOVIE. AND INSIDE OUT 2. BUT THIS
REALLY COULD MAKE IT A BARBENHEIMER SUMMER. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR IT
FOR SO LONG. >> THE BANTER. I HAVE SO SAY THAT THE TWO OF THEM ARE INCREDIBLY HANDSOME STANDING NEXT TO EACH OTHER AS
WELL. JUST GOT TO STATE THE OBVIOUS THERE. YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO FANS OUTSIDE THE MOVIE THEATER GETTING AN EDUCATION ON THIS.
WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU? >> WELL I ACTUALLY HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE. HIS NAME IS ANDREW. ANDREW COME ON OVER.
>> HELLO THERE. >> WOW. >> FIRST OF ALL, TAKE A LOOK AT THE DEDICATION.
ANDREW, TELL EVERYONE YOU JUST
SAW THE MOVIE THIS AFTERNOON. >> IT LIVES UP TO THE HYPE.
MY FAVORITE LINES ABOUT IT.
>> IT IS RATED R. WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT. WITHOUT SPOILING IT, DOES IT
REALLY NEED AN R RATING? >> IT DOES NEED AN R RATING. THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING.
FROM RYAN AND HUGH HAVE BEEN DOING COLLABORATING. THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR. >> SO YOU ARE SAYING IT LIVES UP TO THE HYPE?
>> IT DOES. AND IT OVEREXCEEDS THE HYPE. >> I LOVE IT. WELL LISTEN. ANDREW, WE HAVE BEEN HANGING OUT WITH HIM ALL AFTERNOON.
HE IS ONE OF THE MANY FANS WHO HAVE BEEN LINING UP TO SEE THIS MOVIE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING YOU WILL
BE HEARING ABOUT. NOT JUST IN THE DAYS TO COME. BUT POTENTIALLY THE REST OF THE SUMMER AND EVEN INTO EARLY
FALL. >> YOU GOT TO LOVE ANDREW'S
COMMITMENT THERE. IN 90-DEGREE WEATHER. THAT IS A REAL COMMITMENT.
>> I WORE MY WOLVERINE YELLOW FOR Y'ALL. OKAY? THAT'S AS FAR AS I CAN GO
WITHOUT CHOOSING A SIDE. >> CLOSE ENOUGH.
THANK YOU CHLOE. APPRECIATE IT. >>> STILL TO COME, A LOOK AT THE FINAL OLYMPIC CEREMONY PREPS FROM PARIS COMING UP NEXT.
Paris Olympics opening ceremony in less than 24 hours
>>> OH MAN, IT'S TIME EVERYBODY. EXCITEMENT REACHING ITS FEVER PITCH IN PARIS AND ACROSS THE
WORLD. LESS THAN 24 HOURS OUTS BEFORE
THE OLYMPICS CEREMONY. THE OPENING CEREMONY WILL BE SET WITH ALL PARTICIPATING
COUNTRYING FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER. THOUSANDS OF ATHLETES ARE REPORTING INTO THE OLYMPIC
VILLAGE. THE VILLAGE'S CATERS SAYING THEY WILL INCREASE VOLUME LEVEL
TO SATISFY ATHLETES. CHIEF CORRESPONDENT THERE FOR US. KEIR SIMMONS, I'M TRYING TO
PLAY ALONG HERE. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE FOOD? THEY NEED THEIR PROTEIN.
THEY NEED THEIR EGGS. >> Reporter: YEAH.
YEAH, THEY SURE DO. AND YOU MENTIONED, IT IS ALWAYS THE THING IN THE OLYMPICS YOU DON'T EXPECT.
WE TALK ABOUT THE THINGS WE WORRY ABOUT. YOU WORRY ABOUT THE SEINE.
WILL IT BE CLEAN ENOUGH OR TOO ROUGH? NOW WE GET THIS OTHER ISSUE WHICH FRANKLY WE DIDN'T EXPECT.
A FOOD SHORTAGE. OUR COLLEAGUES AT SKY NEWS SPOKE TO TEAM GREAT BRITAIN. THEY WERE TOLD THAT THERE IS AN
ISSUE BY TEAM GB. SO THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE SOMETHING OF A FOOD SHORTAGE AT THE ATHLETE VILLAGE.
EGGS ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT. ONE OF THE ASPECTS HERE IS THIS WHOLE TRYING TO DO THINGS SUSTAINABLY. TRYING TO GET THE FOOD IN
LOCALLY. ALL THAT KIND OF THING, IT'S NOT EASY RIGHT? WE ALREADY SAW ON SOCIAL MEDIA
WITH ATHLETES ABOUT THE CARDBOARD BEDS. AND PEOPLE WERE KIND OF
LAUGHING ABOUT THEM. THAT WAS AN IDEA FOR SUSTAINABILITY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAVE THE
PLANET BUT THAT MEAN IT ISN'T WORTH IT. >> CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THE CASUAL DROP IN ON PRESIDENT
MACRON >> IT WASN'T A CASUAL DROP-IN. IT WAS ME AND A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE. ALL OF THEM MORE IMPORTANT THAN
I AM. BUT IT WAS THE SUSTAINABILITY
SUMMIT. THE HEAD OF THE PARIS 2024 OLYMPICS WAS THERE. AND I MANAGED TO GRAB HIM AND
HAD A QUICK WORD. HE SAID I FEEL GREAT.
THAT'S THE ATMOSPHERE YOU GET
HERE. YOU CAN'T SAY IT TOO MUCH. FRANKLY, IT WILL BE AMAZING.
DESPITE ALL THAT, THE ATMOSPHERE IS BUZZING.
THEY SEEMED RELAXED. PRESIDENT MACRON GAVE A SPEECH. CHATTED THE PEOPLE. SO THINGS APPEAR TO BE GOING WELL. CROSS YOUR FINGERS.
>> I KNOW THE LAST TIME YOU AND I SPOKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
THE MAYOR. DID YOU EVER DO IT? AND I CHALLENGE YOU TO DO, GO
IN THE SEINE? >> I HAVEN'T IT YET. NO, THANK YOU THOUGH. I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO BE HEALTHY FOR THE NEXT FEW
WEEKS. I GOT SOME WORK TO DO. I'M NOT SAYING I'M MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ATHLETES.
I WANT TO BE CLEAR. IT IS IMPORTANT THEY CAN SWIM SAFELY. AND THEY SAY IT WILL BE SAFE.
BUT I HAVEN'T TAKEN THE PLUNGE YET. >> MAYBE WHEN THE OLYMPIC IS ALL SAID AND DONE. YOU CAN JUMP IN THE RIVER
THERE. >> IT'S A DEAL. IT'S A DEAL. >> OKAY THEN. YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST. >> IT'S A DEAL. WHEN I SAY IT'S A DEAL, I MEAN
IT.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. DON'T FORGET YOUMONIES TOMORROWT 7:00 P.M. EASTERN. THAT IS A WRAP FOR THIS HOUR. COVERAGE PICKS UP RIGHT NOW.
>>> TONIGHT WE COME ON THE AIR WITH A SHOWDOWN AT THE RIGHT HOUSE. THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER TAKING MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND NETANYAHU KAMALA HARRIS. WE ARE GOING TO BREAK DOWN THE HIGH STAKES. PLUS THE SIT DOWN WITH NIKKI
HALEY ONE TIME SUPPORTERS. WERE VOTERS LIKELY STAND.
AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SEEING WILDFIRES. A DANGEROUS SITUATION IN AT
LEAST FIVE STATES AND FIREFIGHTERS STRUGGLING TO PUT IT OUT. NASA ATHLETES WAITING FOR A RIDE BACK TO WORK -- EARTH WILL
HAVE TO WAIT EVEN LONGER. WHILE THE SPACE AGENCY SAYS THEY ARE STILL NOT COMING HOME
AFTER SPENDING A WEEK MORE IN SPACE THAN INTENDED. >>> A MAJOR CHANGE COMING TO A SOUTHWEST FLIGHT NEAR YOU.
>>> WE START WITH A CRITICAL MEETING GOING DOWN AT THE WHITE
HOUSE. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS MEETING WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO.
THE PRESIDENT SPOKE TO HIM EARLIER AS RELATIONS APPEAR FROSTY WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION RACING TO LOCK
IN A CEASE-FIRE DEAL IN THE MIDDLE EAST. LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN GAVE THAT
HISTORIC SPEECH WHERE HE LOOKED TO SUBMIT HIS LEGACY AND OUTLINE WHAT HIS ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO DO NEXT.
WITH SO MUCH OF THE ATTENTION ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. KAMALA HARRIS HITTING HARD,
SPEAKING TO A MAJOR TEACHERS UNION OVER IN TEXAS EARLIER TODAY. ALSO SAYING SHE IS READY TO
DEBATE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WHETHER HE WANTS TO OR NOT.
>> I AM READY TO DEBATE DONALD TRUMP. I AGREED TO THE GRIEVOUSLY
AGREED UPON SEPTEMBER 10 ABATE. NOW IT APPEARS HE IS BACKPEDALING. I AM READY. I THINK THE VOTERS DESERVES TO
SEE THE SPLIT SCREEN THAT EXIST. I AM READY.
LET'S GO. >> BUT EXACTLY WHEN THE TWO OF
THEM TO TAKE THE STAGE IS STILL TO BE DETERMINED. HARRIS HAS LESS THAN TWO WEEKS TO PICK A RUNNING MATE. WE ARE JUST HEARING FROM REPUBLICAN ALLIES AND THE
FORMER PRESIDENT WHO SAY THEY SEE JOSH SHAPIRO IS A PRETTY STRONG CONTENDER. ALL OF THAT AS THEY SHARPEN
ATTACKS. HARRIS'S TEAM SENDING OUT AN EMAIL DESCRIBING DONALD TRUMP AS OLD AND QUITE WEIRD. TRUMP REFERRING TO HER AS IN
HIS WORDS, LUNATIC AND A
CAMPAIGN RALLY AS THE BATTLE BETWEEN THESE TWO ONLY GETS MORE MORE BRUTAL. WITH.TEAM COVERAGE. MARK MARIE IS HERE WITH ME
PULLING DATA. WE HAVE KELLY O'DONNELL AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR US. KELLY, WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE MEETINGS AT THE
WHITE HOUSE? PRESIDENT BIDEN AND VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS MEETING WITH BEBE
NETANYAHU. >> WE KNOW OF THE TWO MEETINGS AND A THIRD WITH THE HOSTAGE
FAMILIES. THAT IS SIGNIFICANT. IT REFLECTS THE STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE U.S. AND ISRAEL AND THE CRITICAL
ISSUES BEFORE THESE LEADERS. CERTAINLY THE U.S. POSITION IS STEADFAST SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL.
AT THE SAME TIME WANTING TO SEE THE CONFLICT WITH HAMAS IN GAZA WINDING DOWN TOWARD CEASE-FIRE.
RESOLUTION OF THE HOSTAGE SITUATION, AND TRYING TO GET TO A MORE STABLE SITUATION, ESPECIALLY WITH THE DEGREE OF
HUMANITARIAN PROBLEMS THAT EXISTED WITH HUNGER AND MEDICAL NEED IN GAZA FOR THOUSANDS.
THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT AND THE TIMING IS
CERTAINLY INTERESTING WITH THE PRESIDENT LEAVING THE CAMPAIGN
STAGE WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WHO WOULD TYPICALLY MEET
WORLD LEADERS. NOW IT TAKES ON THE ADDED SPECTER OF COULD SHE BE THE
EVENTUAL PRESIDENT? IS THAT WHAT IS COMING DOWN THE PIKE? WE KNOW BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS
ALSO GOING TO GO SEE HIS LONGTIME FRIEND DONALD TRUMP. HE IS COVERING ALL THE BASES OF
POTENTIAL LEADERSHIP. WE EXPECT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE MEETING. THESE ARE HEAVY ISSUES WITH A
LOT ON THE LINE, ESPECIALLY FOR THE HOSTAGE FAMILIES, AND FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HIS LEGACY, A
DESIRE TO SEE A WINDING DOWN WITH U.S. SUPPORT TO BRING ABOUT A MORE TABLE RESOLUTION. >> HE TALKS ABOUT IN HIS
ADDRESS IN THE OVAL LAST NIGHT WHAT HE HOPES TO ACCOMPLISH IN
THE REMAINING SIX OR SO MONTHS WHILE HE IS IN OFFICE. HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS
CONVERSATION TODAY WITH THE PRIME MINISTER AS PART OF THAT? >> FORM POLICY HAS BEEN A HUGE PART OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S
POLITICAL IDENTITY. IT IS AN AREA WHERE HE FEELS COMFORTABLE AND HE FEELS AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS UNIQUE IN THE WORLD. THAT GOES FOR THE RUSSIA
UKRAINE WAR THAT HE HAS CERTAINLY BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN WITH TRYING TO KEEP THE
ALLIANCES STRONG TO EXPAND NATO AND TO GET EUROPE TO BE AS
SUPPORTIVE ECONOMICALLY. OBVIOUSLY IF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. AT THE SAME TIME DEALING WITH THE ISSUES WITH ISRAEL WHERE HE
HAS PROVIDED LOTS OF MILITARY SUPPORT, INTELLIGENCE AND COORDINATED SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND ISRAEL WHEN
IRAN WAS SENDING IN ITS AIR MUNITIONS AND THE U.S. WAS ABLE TO HELP STOP THAT ATTACK ON
ISRAEL. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN DEEPLY INVESTED IN FORM POLICY AND TRYING TO BRING TO A STABLE PLACE AND TO SHOW AMERICAN
LEADERSHIP AGAINST HOSTILITY, TERRORIST, AND AUTOCRATIC LEADERS.
HE WANTS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT
AND HAVE THE CHANCE TO WRITE THE LAST CHAPTER OF HIS PRESIDENCY WITH SOME OF THAT IN MIND. HE HAS DOMESTIC ISSUES TOO. BUT CERTAINLY FOREIGN POLICY IS WHERE A PRESIDENT CAN ACT AS A SINGULAR FIGURE.
WHEREAS WITH DOMESTIC POLICY USED FOR MANY CONGRESS AND THAT MAY BE HARDER TO DO IN AN ELECTION YEAR.
>> THANK YOU. I WANT TO BRING IN MARK MURRAY TO TALK ABOUT POLLING AND LOOKING AT THE MATCHUP BETWEEN VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS AND DONALD TRUMP. I KNOW THERE IS NEW POLLING OUT
FROM THE CHICAGO TIMES. ALSO LOOKING AT YOUNG PEOPLE AS WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS
CONVERSATION BEING HAD RIGHT NOW BETWEEN BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ALONG WITH VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS. WALK US THROUGH SOME OF THE
THINGS THAT STOOD OUT TO YOU. >> OVERALL THIS IS A CLOSE AND COMPETITIVE RACE AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN'S EXIT FROM THE
2024 PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST. THE POLE OVERALL HAS DONALD TRUMP A HEAD BY ONE PERCENTAGE
POINT AMONG LIKELY VOTERS. THAT IS WELL WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR. NOTABLY IT IS A MUCH CLOSER CONTEST THEN IT WAS RIGHT AFTER
THAT POOR DEBATE PERFORMANCE BY JOE BIDEN WHEN DONALD TRUMP HAD A SIX-POINT LEAD AMONG LIKELY
VOTERS. YOU ASKED ABOUT YOUNG VOTERS IN THIS. IN THIS CURRENT MATCHUP HARRIS
HAS ABOUT A 20 POINT LEAD AMONG YOUNG VOTERS OVER DONALD TRUMP. THAT IS A MUCH WIDER LEAD THEN
WE HAVE SEEN IN PAST POLLING.
THAT IS NOT THE ONLY POLL THAT SHOWS HARRIS DOING BETTER AMONG
YOUNG VOTERS.
DONALD TRUMP IS ACTUALLY DOING A LITTLE BETTER WITH SENIORS THAN HE WAS DOING WHEN JOE BIDEN WAS HIS OPPONENT. AND LITTLE YIN AND YANG WHEN WE
LOOK AT THE YOUTH VOTE VERSUS FINGERS. >> I ALSO THINK IT IS INTERESTING. AS THIS NEW POLL IS COMING OUT WE ARE SEEING HARRIS HIT BACK AT THESE RESURFACED COMMENTS
FROM J. D. VANCE WHERE HE SAID THE COUNTRY IS BEING LED BY A
BUNCH OF CHALICE CAT LADIES. WALK US THROUGH THAT. >> OF COURSE THAT IS OLDER FOOTAGE FROM J. D. VANCE AND
REALLY GOING TO THE POINT THAT KAMALA HARRIS DOES NOT HAVE CHILDREN OF HER OWN.
ALSO HER STEPCHILDREN ARE POINTING OUT KAMALA HARRIS HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE MOTHER HELPING TO RAISE THEM.
THIS IS ACTUALLY BEING LITIGATED. WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE POLLING IT IS WORTH NOTING THE
HUMONGOUS GENDER GAP THAT WE WERE SEEING BETWEEN MAN AND FEMALE RESPONDENTS WHERE DONALD
TRUMP HAS A VERY LARGE LEAD AMONG MEN. HARRIS HAS A REALLY BIG LEAD AMONG WOMEN.
WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF SOCIAL MEDIA RESPONSES COMING FROM WOMEN WHO DID NOT LIKE THAT
PRIOR AND PREVIOUS J. D. VANCE RESPONSE. >> THANK YOU, MARK.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WILDFIRES. THOUSANDS FORCED TO EVACUATE THEIR HOMES AS THESE
FIREFIGHTERS ARE BURNING OUT OF CONTROL. FIREFIGHTERS ARE BATTLING DOZENS OF BLAZES.
THE SITUATION IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE DANGEROUS. TAKE A LOOK.
IMAGINE STANDING THERE AND THAT EXPLOSION CAUGHT ON CAMERA.
THE PARK FIRE HAS EXTENDED TO ROUGHLY 45,000 ACRES IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS. TODAY OFFICIALS ARRESTED A MAN
WHO IS SUSPECTED OF STARTING THE FIRE. IN OREGON THE GOVERNOR CALLING
IN THE NATIONAL GUARD AFTER FIRES THERE REACHED MEGA FIRE STATUS. THAT MEANS AT LEAST 100,000
ACRES EACH. THE JERSEY FIRE ALARM BURNING AROUND 270,000 ACRES, CAUSING
ON-AND-OFF CLOSURES OF I-84. LIGHTNING STORMS ARE NOW MAKING IT EVEN TOUGHER FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO DO THE JOB.
STARTED IN CALIFORNIA FOR US. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THESE WILDFIRES AND THE SUSPECT WHO
IN FACT WAS ARRESTED. >> THE BUTTE COUNTY DISTRICT
ATTORNEY HAS A 42-YEAR-OLD UNNAMED MAN IN CUSTODY THAT THEY SAY IS SUSPECTED OF STARTING THE FIRE THREATENING
THE CITY OF CHICO. THEY SAID THAT HE WAS ALLEGEDLY
WITNESSED PUSHING A FLAMING CAR INTO A GULLY IN AN URBAN WILDERNESS PARK. THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THIS FIRE IS SO DANGEROUS.
IT IS EXTREMELY CLOSE TO THE CITY OF CHICO. THAT OUTER PERIMETER OF THE FIRE ONLY ABOUT ONE MILE AWAY FROM THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE CITY IF YOU LOOK AT A MAP. AUTHORITIES HAVE SAID THEY ARE
THE RIGHT EVERYTHING THEY HAVE AT THIS FIRE AND IT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH. THEY HAVE BEEN BRINGING IN
REINFORCEMENTS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE. ALL DAY CAL FIRE HAS BEEN
STRUGGLING TO GET THAT ONE UNDER CONTROL. ABOUT 4000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
ORDERED EVACUATED. >> TALK ABOUT OREGON. YOU HAVE THESE MEGA-FIRES IN OREGON. >> YES.
YOU MENTIONED THE DURKEE FIRE IS ABOUT 270,000 ACRES. TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT THAT IS
MORE THAN 400 SQUARE MILES. JUST BY COMPARISON THE WHOLE CITY OF NEW YORK IS ABOUT 300
SQUARE MILES. WE ARE DEALING WITH A ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE FAILURE. IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS SOME OF THE EVACUATION ORDERS
WERE LISTED. THAT IS GOOD NEWS FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE AREA. IT IS JUST BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE FIRE IS MOVING.
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO SAID THERE HAVE BEEN SOME RAIN WHICH ONE SHERIFF DESCRIBED AS I GOT
THEM. IT IS NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO MEANINGFULLY REDUCE THE FIRE. THAT RAIN ALSO COMES WITH
LIGHTNING AND VERY FAST WIND, SOMETIMES UP TO 70-75 MILES PER HOUR WHICH MAKES THE TASK OF
CONTAINING THAT ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE FIRE THAT MUCH HARDER. >> THANK YOU, DAVID. I WANT TO GO TO TEXAS NOW WHERE
A FORMER SCHOOL POLICE OFFICER IS PLEADING NOT GUILTY TO CHARGES HE FAILED TO PROTECT 19
CHILDREN AND 2 TEACHERS KILLED IN THE MAY '22 SHOOTING.
SOME OF THE VICTIMS LOVED ONES ANGRILY CONFRONTING THE FORMER OFFICER AS HE LEFT COURT.
>> SAY SOMETHING TO US! LOOK AT US!
>> SAY YOU ARE SORRY. YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY SORRY TO US.
>> ADRIAN GONZALEZ FACES 29 COUNTS OF CHILD ENDANGERMENT. HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OFFICERS ON THE SCENE. THE INDICTMENT THAT HE FAILED
TO DISTRACT, ENGAGE OR DELAY THE SHOOTER.
NEARLY 400 OFFICERS RESPONDED INCLUDING THE SCHOOL POLICE CHIEF WHO ALSO FACES CHARGES THAT THEY WAITED MORE THAN 70
MINUTES TO GO INTO A CLASSROOM AND KILL THE ATTACKER. WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER 21 PEOPLE MOSTLY 9 AND 10-YEAR-OLDS ALONG WITH TWO TEACHERS WERE DEAD.
THE NAMES AND FACES YOU CAN SEE
HERE. WE TALK ABOUT 400 OFFICERS RESPONDING THAT DAY, ALL
WAITING FOR 70 MINUTES OUTSIDE OF THAT SCHOOL, OUTSIDE THOSE CLASSROOMS WITHOUT ENGAGING THE SHOOTER. DO WE KNOW WHY THESE TWO MEN
WERE SINGLED OUT NOW AND WHAT MORE IS TO COME?
>> Reporter: WHAT WE KNOW IS BOTH OF THESE TWO FORMER OFFICERS WERE PART OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT POLICE DEPARTMENT. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST APARTMENT THAT RESPONDED.
IT HAS BEEN A LONG PROCESS. IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN TWO YEARS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS FEELING FRUSTRATED MOST OF THE TIME. IT WAS HARD FOR THEM TO GET
INFORMATION AS TO WHERE THE INVESTIGATION WAS GOING. TWO ONE HALF YEARS AGO I DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW HOW LONG THE OFFICERS HAD ORIGINALLY WAITED. EVENTUALLY ALL OF THIS INFORMATION WAS RELEASED. NOW WE KNOW FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE VICTIM HAVE BEEN -- VICTIMS
HAVE BEEN VERY UPSET. NOW WE HAVE THESE TWO OFFICERS
THAT HAVE BEEN INDICTED. ADRIAN GONZALEZ APPEARED IN COURT TODAY AND PLED NOT GUILTY. THE JUDGE INFORMING HIM IF FOUND GUILTY HE COULD FACE UP TO TWO YEARS IN PRISON.
AGAIN, IT IS THE BEGINNING OF A LEGAL PROCESS. WE STILL DO NOT KNOW IF MORE OFFICES WILL BE CHARGED.
WE ALSO HAD A LOT OF COUNTY POLICE OFFICERS RESPONDED AND STATE POLICE OFFICERS AS WELL AS OFFICERS. LET'S HEAR FROM GONZALES'S
ATTORNEY WHO SPOKE TODAY AFTER THE HEARING. >> ALL HE DID WAS SHOW UP AND
TRY TO HELP.
OUR POSITION IS GOOD THAT ANGER BE DIRECTED TO MR. GONZALES.
THERE WERE OVER 370 OFFICERS THERE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN OR HEARD OF A THEORY ABOUT WHY MR. GONZALES
IS BEING ANGLED OUT.
>> AFTER THE ATTORNEY SPOKE I SPOKE TO THE FATHER OF ONE OF THOSE VICTIMS. HE TOLD ME THAT HE PARTIALLY AGREES WITH WHAT THE ATTORNEY SAID, SAYING OTHER OFFICERS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. MOST OF THE PARENTS THAT WERE
HERE TODAY SAY MR. GONZALES IS RESPONSIBLE ACCORDING TO THE WAY THEY SEE THIS AND THEY
AGREE WITH THE CHARGES THAT HE IS NOW FACING. >> I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS
THAT HAVE BEEN THERE. WE SAW SOME FOOTAGE OF SOME FAMILY MEMBERS YELLING AT
GONZALES AS HE ENTERED THE
COURTROOM. WHAT DO THEY WANT TO SEE HAPPEN? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN
BRING THEM ANY CLOSER TO THIS HORRIFIC SITUATION THAT THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH AND CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH TODAY?
>> JAZMIN, I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING THAT IS GOING TO BRING COMPLETE CLOSURE.
YOU LOOK AT THE BUILDING BEHIND ME, THE CORE BUILDING IS ACROSS THE STREET FROM TOWNSQUARE WHERE THE MEMORIAL WAS SET UP
FOR THE VICTIMS. IN FACT, IF YOU SEE THE VIDEO WHERE GUN VIOLENCE WAS WALKING
AFTER THE HEARING TODAY AND FAMILY MEMBERS WERE YELLING AT HIM, AT THE FAR AND YOU CAN SEE THE PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN SET
UP IN MEMORY OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS GOING TO BE VERY
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET CLOSURE. THEY FEEL LIKE SOMEONE IS BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF JUSTICE
COULD BE TAKING PLACE. THEY DO SAY THEY WANT TO SEE MORE PEOPLE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED.
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LAWSUITS THE FAMILIES HAVE FILED AGAINST
THE MANUFACTURER OF THE WEAPON, AGAINST THE STATE POLICE AND OTHER LAWSUITS. FOR NOW IT IS A STEP IN THE DIRECTION THEY WANTED TO SEE. WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT
HAPPENS AND IF ANY OTHER OFFICERS WILL BE INDICTED IN THE FUTURE. >>> TONIGHT NASA SAYING TWO OF ITS ASTRONAUTS NOW IN SPACE FOR
50 DAYS AND COUNTING WILL HAVE TO WAIT EVEN LONGER BEFORE THEY CAN COME HOME FROM THE
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. THE SPACE AGENCY SAYING THEY STILL NEED TO FINISH GETTING SOME TESTING ON THE GROUND
BEFORE THEY GIVE THEIR ASTRONAUTS THE GO-AHEAD TO GO BACK HOME. BOEING'S FIRST TEST FLIGHT WENT
UP TO SPACE IN EARLY JUNE AND IT HAS BEEN THERE EVERY SENSE. THAT IS A LOT LONGER THAN THE
EIGHT DAYS ORIGINALLY PLANNED. NASA SAID IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF ISSUES WITH THE THRUSTERS ON THE CAPSULE AND THAT IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THEY HAVE
BACKUPS FOR GETTING THE TWO PEOPLE YOU ARE SEEING HERE HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
THEY ARE STILL HOPING THAT THE STAR LINER IS GOING TO WORK AND BE ABLE TO BRING ASTRONAUTS BACK AND FORTH FROM THE SPACE STATION FOR YEARS TO COME.
NASA HAS ALREADY SCRUBBED TWO TENTATIVE RETURN DATES AS THEY TRIED TO FIX THESE ISSUES.
ARE WE ANY CLOSER TO GETTING THESE ASTRONAUTS HOME? >> NASA SAYS THEY ARE CLOSE,
BUT THEY STILL HAVE MORE WORK TO BE DONE. MAINLY THERE ARE TWO ITEMS ON
THE CHECKLIST THAT WE KNOW OF SPECIFICALLY FROM OFFICIALS. THEY SAY THEY WANT TO DO FIRE TESTING OF THE THRUSTERS IN
SPACE WHILE THE SPACECRAFT IS DOCKED TO THE INTERNATIONAL
SPACE STATION. THEY ALSO SAY THEY WANT TO DO AN AGENCY REVIEW THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN UNTIL EARLIEST LATE NEXT
WEEK. HERE'S WHAT WE HEARD FROM OFFICIALS. >> RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE TEARDOWN OF THE THRUSTERS.
WE HAVE IT DISASSEMBLED. WE ARE LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY AT THE FUEL ON THE FUEL VALVE
AND -- >> WE HAVE TO GO. VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IS SPEAKING NOW AFTER THE MEETING WITH PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU. >> FROM WHEN I WAS A YOUNG GIRL
COLLECTING TREES TO PLANT TREES FOR ISRAEL, TO MY TIME AT THE
UNITED STATES SENATE AND NOW AT THE WHITE HOUSE I HAVE HAD AN
UNWAVERING COMMITMENT TO THE EXISTENCE OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL, TO ITS SECURITY AND THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL. I HAVE SAID IT MANY TIMES. IT BEARS REPEATING.
ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF AND HOW IT DOES SO MATTERS. HAMAS IS A BRUTAL TERRORIST
ORGANIZATION. ON OCTOBER 7 HAMAS TRIGGERED THIS WAR WHEN IT MASSACRED 1200
IT -- INNOCENT PEOPLE, INCLUDING 44 AMERICANS. HAMAS HAS COMMITTED HORRIFIC ACTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND
TOOK 250 HOSTAGES. THERE ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO REMAIN CAPTIVE IN GAZA.
I HAVE MET WITH THE FAMILIES OF THESE AMERICAN HOSTAGES
MULTIPLE TIMES. AS I'VE TOLD THEM EACH TIME THEY ARE NOT ALONE. I STAND WITH THEM.
PRESIDENT BIDEN AND I ARE WORKING EVERY DAY TO BRING THEM
HOME. I ALSO EXPRESSED WITH THE PRIME MINISTER MY SERIOUS CONCERN
ABOUT THE SCALE OF HUMAN SUFFERING IN GAZA, INCLUDING THE DEPTHS OF FAR TOO MANY
INNOCENT CIVILIANS. I MADE CLEAR MY SERIOUS CONCERN
ABOUT THE DIRE HUMANITARIAN SITUATIONS THERE. WITH OVER 2 MILLION PEOPLE FACING HIGH LEVELS OF FOOD
INSECURITY. HALF 1 MILLION PEOPLE FACING CATASTROPHIC LEVELS OF ACUTE
FOOD INSECURITY. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN GAZA OVER THE PAST NINE MONTHS IS DEVASTATING. THE IMAGES OF DEAD CHILDREN AND
DESPERATE, HUNGRY PEOPLE FLEEING TO SAFETY, SOMETIMES
DISPLACED FOR THE SECOND, THIRD
OR FOURTH TIME. WE CANNOT LOOK AWAY IN THE FACE OF THESE TRAGEDIES. WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BECOME NUMB TO THE SUFFERING.
I WILL NOT BE SILENT. THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN THERE IS A
DEAL ON THE TABLE FOR A CEASE- FIRE AND A HOSTAGE DEAL.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE RECALL WHAT THE DEAL INVOLVES. THE FIRST PHASE WILL BRING ABOUT A FULL CEASE-FIRE,
INCLUDING A WITHDRAWAL OF THE ISRAELI MILITARY FROM POPULATION CENTERS IN GAZA.
IN THE SECOND PHASE THE ISRAELI MILITARY WOULD WITHDRAW FROM
GAZA ENTIRELY. IT WOULD LEAD TO A PERMANENT END TO THE HOSTILITY.
IT IS TIME FOR THIS WAR TO END AND END IN A WAY WHERE ISRAEL
IS SECURE, ALL THE HOSTAGES ARE RELEASED. THE SUFFERING OF PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ENDS AND THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE CAN EXERCISE
THEIR RIGHT TO FREEDOM, DIGNITY, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.
THERE HAS BEEN HOPEFUL MOVEMENT IN THE TALKS TO SECURE AN AGREEMENT ON THIS DEAL.
AS I JUST TOLD PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU, IT IS TIME TO GET THIS DEAL DONE. TO EVERYONE WHO HAS BEEN CALLING FOR AN CEASE-FIRE AND
TO EVERYONE WHO YEARNS FOR PEACE, I SEE YOU. I HEAR YOU.
LET'S GET THE DEAL DONE SO THAT WE CAN GET A CEASE-FIRE TO END THE WAR. LET'S BRING THE HOSTAGES HOME.
LET'S PROVIDE MUCH-NEEDED RELIEF TO THE PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE. ULTIMATELY, I REMAIN COMMITTED TO A PATH FORWARD THAT CAN LEAD TO A TWO STATE SOLUTION.
I KNOW RIGHT NOW IT IS HARD TO CONCEIVE OF THAT PROSPECT, BUT A TWO STATE SOLUTION IS THE ONLY PATH THAT ENSURES ISRAEL
REMAINS A SECURE, JEWISH AND
DEMOCRATIC STATE, AND ONE THAT ENSURES PALESTINIANS CAN FINALLY REALIZE THE FREEDOMS, SECURITY AND PROSPERITY THAT THEY RIGHTLY DESERVE.
I WILL CLOSE WITH THIS, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THE WAR IN GAZA IS NOT A BINARY ISSUE.
HOWEVER, TOO OFTEN THE CONVERSATION IS BINARY, WHEN
THE REALITY IS ANYTHING BUT. I ASK MY FELLOW AMERICANS TO HELP ENCOURAGE EFFORTS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMPLEXITY, THE
NUANCE, AND THE HISTORY OF THE REGION. LET US ALL CONDEMN TERRORISM
AND VIOLENCE. LET US ALL DO WHAT WE CAN TO PREVENT THE SUFFERING OF
INNOCENT CIVILIANS. LET US CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM,
ISLAMOPHOBIA AND HATE OF ANY KIND. LET US WORK TO UNITE OUR
COUNTRY. I THINK YOU. >> A MAJOR MOMENT FOR VICE
PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS SPEAKING TO CAMERAS AFTER MEETING WITH ISRAEL PRIME
MINISTER BEBE NETANYAHU AND LIKELY THE NOMINEE FOR THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. BEFORE WE GET INTO THIS I DO
WANT TO SUM UP WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT AFTER THIS MEETING IN WHICH SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW ISRAEL HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF. SHE HAS REITERATED THIS MANY
TIMES OVER. SHE CALLED HAMAS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. SHE NAMED THE AMERICAN HOSTAGES STILL BEING HELD IN GAZA, EVERY SINGLE ONE ALONG WITH THE REMAINS OF THE TWO MANNING
HOSTAGES INSIDE GAZA. SHE WENT ON TO IDENTIFY THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS, TALKING ABOUT THE IMAGES OF THE DEAD CHILDREN AND SAYING WE CANNOT BE NUMB TO THESE IMAGES.
I WILL NOT, SHE SAID, AND I QUOTE HERE, BE SILENT. SHE THEN TALKED ABOUT THE CEASE- FIRE DEAL THAT WAS ON THE TABLE AND IT -- AND A FULL ALL CEASE
FIRE. THE SECOND PHASE WOULD BE A WITHDRAWAL OF THE ISRAELI MILITARY. SHE THEN ADDRESSES VOTERS IN
THE NATION AND THE FOLKS THAT HAPPEN WORRIED ABOUT THE POLICIES GOING FORWARD. NOT ONLY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, BUT WHAT PRIME
MINISTER BEBE NETANYAHU IS DOING. SHE SAID I SEE YOU, I HEAR YOU AND ADVOCATE FOR PEACE. WAS SENT OUT TO YOU HERE?
>> THIS IS REALLY A MAJOR MOMENT. SHE WAS REALLY COMING HERE AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE SHE WAS
BEING CLEAR ABOUT HER GOALS. WHAT SHE TALKED ABOUT WHAT BEBE NETANYAHU, BUT ALSO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HER ADMINISTRATION MIGHT DO WHEN IT COMES TO THE MIDDLE EAST. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
ESPECIALLY THE BASE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT IS REALLY LOOKING FOR MORE ANSWERS AND
MORE PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT THE SUFFERING GOING ON IN GAZA. THERE IS THAT VOTE IN PLACES
LIKE MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA WHERE A LARGE MUSLIM POPULATION IS SAYING THAT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS. THEY WERE VERY ANGERED AT THE
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE POLICIES THEY THINK LEAD TO CIVILIAN
DEATHS IN GAZA. USING THEY SAY AMERICAN MONEY BECAUSE OF A THAT GOES TO
ISRAEL. WHEN I LOOK BACK I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT SHE STARTED OFF WITH THIS MOMENT WHERE SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE
FACT THAT SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL COLLECTING FUNDS TO PLANT TREES IN ISRAEL. SHE IS TRYING TO DEFINE HERSELF AS A CANDIDATE AND BRING PEOPLE
IN TO WHO SHE IS AND WHAT HAS GONE INTO THIS MOMENT WHERE SHE IS NOW AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET
AND LIKELY TO BE AT THE TOP. SHE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT
THERE WAS A DIRE SITUATION IN GAZA. I THOUGHT ABOUT THE FACT SHE
WAS READING AND TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE DEAD CHILDREN AND DESPERATE PEOPLE. REALLY GOING TO THE HEART OF
WHAT THIS ARGUMENT IS AND WHAT THIS CONVERSATION IS ALL ABOUT. WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY TIMES
IMAGES, HORRIFYING IMAGES COMING OUT OF THE REGION. I THINK SHE'S TALKING DIRECTLY TO PEOPLE MOVED BY THOSE
IMAGES. I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT SHE SAID IT WAS TIME TO GET THE DEAL DONE. THAT WAS THE MESSAGE TO BEBE NETANYAHU, BEING VERY CLEAR THAT THIS WAR NEEDS TO COME TO
AN END. I PICKED UP ON WHAT YOU SAID. I SEE YOU AND I HEAR YOU. THAT IS THE KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT MOST PEOPLE.
HARRIS AIDES HAVE TOLD ME THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ELECTION NOT
JUST ABOUT POLICY, BUT HOW YOU MAKE PEOPLE FEEL. IN THIS MOMENT SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SEEN AND HEARD. I THINK IN SOME WAYS PEOPLE
WOULD SAY MAYBE SHE CAME OVERLY GENUINE. SHE WENT BACK AND STARTED WITH HER LONG TIES TO ISRAEL AS A
LITTLE GIRL. >> A MAJOR MOMENT FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT AND LIKELY NOMINEE. THANK YOU FOR STICKING WITH US. MARK, I'M GOING TO GO TO YOU.
WE KNEW OBVIOUSLY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION STRUGGLING IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN WHEN IT CAME TO VOTERS AND SHE
ADDRESSED VOTERS HAD ON AT THE VERY END OF HER SPEECH IN WHICH SHE SAID I SEE YOU. I HEAR YOU.
WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT? >> WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO ME IS THERE WAS NO DAYLIGHT
BETWEEN PRESIDENT BIDEN POLICY AND WHAT HARRIS ENDED UP SAYING
TODAY. I THINK A LOT OF US WERE LOOKING TO SEE IF SHE WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE DAYLIGHT.
DISAGREE WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN ON THE MARGINS. I SAW ABSOLUTELY NO DAYLIGHT AT
ALL. ALSO, WHAT ALSO CAME OUT WITH HER TALK ABOUT THAT THIS IS NOT A BINARY ISSUE.
YOU ARE EITHER WITH THE ISRAELIS OR WITH THE PALESTINIANS. SHE REALLY DID CARVE OUT A MIDDLE GROUND TALKING ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE CEASE-FIRE.
TALKING ABOUT A PERMANENT TWO STATE SOLUTION. ALSO CONDEMNING THE VIOLENCE THAT HAMAS ENDED UP COMMITTING. ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE TRAGEDY FOR GAZA AS WELL.
REALLY TRYING TO THREAT THAT NEEDLE. >> MARK MURRAY, I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO AS WELL.
THANK YOU. KELLY O'DONNELL I WANT TO WRAP THINGS UP WITH YOU. I THINK MARK WAS RIGHT. SHE WAS VERY MUCH IN LOCKSTEP
WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN, REITERATING HER STANCE IS THE SAME STANCE IN WHICH PRESIDENT BIDEN HAVE HAD. AT THE VERY END, AND I THINK
THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT IN WHICH SHE ADDRESSED AMERICANS ARE LISTENING TO HER IN THIS
FIRST BIG FOREIGN POLICY MOMENT, SAYING I SEE YOU. I HEAR YOU.
>> FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT SHE DOES NOT WANT DAYLIGHT BETWEEN
HER POSITION AND THE PRESIDENTS. PART OF WHAT MAKES HER SUCCESSFUL IN THIS NEXT PHASE IS TO BE UNITED WITH JOE BIDEN.
HE HAS ENDORSED HER. THEY HAVE BEEN GOVERNING
PARTNERS.
WHAT YOU DO GET IS THAT SHE SAYS IT IN HER OWN VOICE. SHE BRINGS HER LIFE EXPERIENCE TO AN ISSUE OF THIS MAGNITUDE, JUST AS HE BRINGS HIS HALF CENTURY OF EXPERIENCE AND FREQUENTLY LEAVES ON HIS PAST RELATIONSHIPS WITH PRIME MINISTERS GOING BACK.
WHAT THIS TRULY IS A BOUT A NEW MESSENGER CARRYING THE SAME MISSION. SHE IS ABLE TO DO IT IN WAYS
JOE BIDEN COULD NOT. YOU COULD ARGUE HE COULD DO THINGS THAT SHE COULD NOT.
RIGHT NOW THE FOCUS IS ON WHERE WILL SHE TAKE THIS FORWARD? IT SOUNDS FRESH TO MANY PEOPLE'S EARS. IT SPEAKS TO SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT HAPPEN REFLECTED IN THE NATIONAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CONCERN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CIVILIANS SO GRIEVOUSLY HARMED BY THIS CONFLICT. SHE WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE
IMPORTANCE OF STANDING WITH ISRAEL AND STANDING AGAINST ANTI-SEMITISM AND GETTING THE HOSTAGES HOME. SHE HAD ALL OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES. SHE DID IT IN A WAY THAT PRESENTED HER POINT OF YOU ON
WHAT IS A BIDEN-HARRIS FOREIGN POLICY. THIS IS A MOMENT FOR HER TO BEGIN TO STEP FORWARD.
WE WILL SEE A LOT OF THAT WITH A FUSION OF HER OFFICIAL ROLE
AND HER CANDIDATE ROLE IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE NOT REALLY SEEN BEFORE. THAT MAKES IT ALL THE MORE
MAGNIFIED IN THIS CRITICAL MOMENT. >> A VERY BIG MOMENT F
>> SOUTHWEST AIRLINES
ANNOUNCING SOME CHANGES TODAY SAYING THEY ARE ABANDONING THEIR FAMOUS OPEN SEATING APPROACH. THAT IS WHEN PASSENGERS
LITERALLY -- SOUTHWEST SAYS THEY ARE OFFERING PREMIUM SEATING AS SOON AS NEXT YEAR.
IT COMES AFTER LACKLUSTER EARNINGS. >> THIS IS WHAT SOUTHWEST HAS
BEEN KNOWN FOR FOR A VERY LONG TIME WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.
>> I THINK THIS SHIFT, LISTEN, PEOPLE ARE SUPER FANS OF SOUTHWEST. THEY ARE GOING TO POINT OUT
ACCESSIBILITY, AFFORDABILITY. THEIR FEAR IS MOVING AWAY FROM THAT WILL ALSO MOVE AWAY FROM THOSE THINGS WHEN WE LOSE THE OPEN SEATING.
THE CEO POINTS TO RESEARCH THEY COLLECTED.
SOME 80% OF THEIR CUSTOMERS SAY THEY PREFER AN ASSIGNED SEAT. THEY SAY THE NUMBER ONE REASON PEOPLE ARE NOT CHOOSING
SOUTHWEST IS THE LACK OF ASSIGNED SEATS. WE ARE HEARING A LITTLE BACK AND-FORTH. TAKE A LISTEN.
>> IT WAS MORE CONVENIENT TO SIT WHERE YOU WANT TO SIT. >> TYPICALLY WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE RUSHING THE SECTION TO
BOARD, YOU HAVE PEOPLE RUNNING IN FRONT OF YOU. I THINK IT'S NICE TO KNOW YOUR
SEAT IS SECURE. >> THERE IS STILL A LOT OF PRESSURE ON SOUTHWEST. YOU LOOK AT HIS Q2 NUMBERS.
THE PROFITS ARE DOWN. THEY ARE FACING A LOT OF PRESSURE. THEY ARE HOPING BY ROLLING OUT ASSIGNED SEATS THAT WILL APPEAR
TO APPEAL TO MORE PEOPLE.
THESE OTHER MAJOR AIRLINES, THE DIFFERENCES A LOT OF THESE AIRLINES ARE EXPERIENCING
OVERCAPACITY. DESPITE THE RECORD SUMMER TRAVEL. WHAT I MEAN IS THEY HAVE SO
MANY EXTRA SEATS. BECAUSE SOUTHWEST DOES NOT HAVE THESE PREMIER SEATS, THESE
EXTRA COSTLY SEATS THEY ARE NOT SEEING THE LIFT IN REVENUE. THEY'RE HOPING THIS WILL HELP TO DIG THEM OUT OF THAT
SCENARIO. >> I LIKE AN ASSIGNED SEAT AND
WHENEVER I FLY WITH SOUTHWEST I HAD ANXIETY IF I GOT THERE TOO
LATE. >> THIS IS A SCRAMBLE FOR A LOT HER BID FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. SHE WILL JOIN SOME OF THE STARS OF THE SHOW ENCOURAGING
AMERICANS TO REGISTER TO VOTE. >>> NEW QUESTIONS AROUND A YOGA
RETREAT WHERE A CHICAGO WOMAN WENT MISSING. WHAT WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE
DISAPPEARING OF A SECOND AMERICAN MORE THAN A DECADE AGO. PLUS GERMANY'S BIGGEST AIRPORT CANCELING MORE THAN 100 FLIGHTS. WE ARE GOING TO TELL YOU WHY
COMINGYOGA RETREAT
WE HAVE MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. >> CERTAINLY.
THANK YOU. >>> NBC COVERS HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL STORIES EVERY DAY. BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH TO LISTEN TO
ALL OF THEM OUR TEAMS AROUND THE GLOBE HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. HERE IS A LOOK AT WHAT THEY
HAVE FOUND. AUTHORITIES DETAINED SEVERAL PEOPLE OVER SUSPECTED TERRORIST ACTIVITIES. THIS ALL HAPPENED ONE DAY BEFORE THE OLYMPIC OPEN.
>>> IN TAIWAN SEVERE FLOODS AFTER A TYPO SWEPT ACROSS THE
ISLAND. YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO SAVE SOME OF THEIR STUFF.
OFFICIALS SAYING THIS IS THE STRONGEST TYPHOON TO HIT TAIWAN IN YEARS WITH WIND UP TO 100 MILES PER HOUR. >>> THE BUSIEST AIRPORT IN
GERMANY CANCELING HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS AFTER CLIMATE ACTIVISTS REACHED SECURITY.
SOME APPARENTLY ATTACHING THEMSELVES TO THE TARMAC TRYING TO DISRUPT THIS SUPER BUSY OVER
-- SUPER BUSY TRAVEL WEEK. COMING UP, IT STARTED AS A
GOSPEL PAGE AND NOW HAS SERIOUS POLITICAL COVERAGE. BOTH PARTIES WANT A PIECE OF THE SHADE
>>> IN-DEPTH REPORTING ON A TOPIC WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING. A MEDIA OUTLET WITH A HUGE BLACK AUDIENCE THAT COULD END
UP BEING HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL IN THIS ELECTION. THIS A BROOM STARTED A TMZ
STYLE GOSPEL PAGE, BUT HAS BECOME A MASSIVE PLATFORM WITH MILLIONS OF VIEWERS AND A DEMOGRAPHIC BOTH CANDIDATES
WANT TO TRY TO WIN OVER. IT HAS NOT BEEN WITHOUT
CONTROVERSY. WE SPOKE TO THE FOUNDER ABOUT THE RISE AND THE RESPONSIBILITY. THE SHADE ROOM, WHAT STARTED AS
A CELEBRITY GOSSIP INSTAGRAM PAGE ROOTED IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY, ONCE EVEN CALLED
INSTAGRAM'S TMZ IS RAPIDLY TRANSFORMING INTO A FULL FLEDGED MEDIA COMPANY.
PUSHING INTO SERIOUS POLITICAL COVERAGE. >> THE SHADE ROOM STARTED ON
ACCIDENT. IT WAS A DARE FROM ONE OF MY FRIENDS TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE. >> SHE SAID SHE FOUND AT THE
SHADE ROOM BROKEN DOWN ON HER LUCK. >> IT BLEW UP WITH OVER $10,000 IN THE FIRST WEEK AND A HALF. SIX MONTHS 500,000 FROM THERE
IT HAS CONSTANTLY GROWN.
>> NOW THE SHADE ROOM HAS 40 MILLION FOLLOWERS ACROSS THEIR PLATFORM. THE SITE STILL LOOKS MORE LIKE
TMZ AND POST OFTEN USE INFORMATION FROM OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS. THE SHADE ROOM REPORTEDLY BRINGS IN MILLIONS PER YEAR. THE COMPANY WOULD NOT CONFIRM
REVENUE NUMBERS WITH NBC NEWS. IT HAS EVEN JOINED THE WHITE
HOUSE PRESS POOL TRAVELING WITH VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS ON
AIR FORCE II. A MORE SERIOUS TONE SOMETIMES
CLASHING WITH THE SOCIAL MEDIA ROOTS. THE PAGE RUNNING SPONSOR CONTENT LIKE THIS ALONGSIDE
MORE NEWSY POSTS.
FACING CRITICISM AFTER A POST IN 2023 ABOUT MALLEY WHILE FIRE VICTIMS.
THE POST ACCUSED OF UNDERPLAYING PRESIDENT BIDEN'S WILDFIRE RESPONSE AND NOT CLEARLY SHARING THE ENTIRETY OF
FEDERAL SUPPORT. >> HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SAFETY MEASURES IN PLACE SO THAT THERE IS NO MISINFORMATION PUT OUT?
>> IF YOU GO ONLINE PEOPLE WILL SAY IF IT IS NOT ON THE SHADE ROOM WE DON'T BELIEVE IT. BEING REPARABLE IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US.
ALL OF OUR WRITERS HAVE TO HAVE JOURNALISM DEGREES. WE ALSO HIRED A POLITICAL CONSULTANCY FIRM. ALL OF OUR POLITICAL POST ARE
FILTERED THROUGH THAT. >> AS IT CONTINUES TO GROW AND WITH A HISTORIC ELECTION COMING UP IN NOVEMBER THE SHADE ROOM OFFERS A UNIQUE CONDUIT TO MANY
BLACK VOTERS. IT'S AUDIENCE AND FOLLOWERS HELP TO MAKE UP A DEMOGRAPHIC THEY PROVE CRUCIAL IN 2020. ONE THAT NOW BOTH KAMALA HARRIS
AND DONALD TRUMP ARE
AGGRESSIVELY COURTING. THE LATEST POLLING SHOWING 32% OF THOSE VOTERS CURRENTLY DISAPPROVING OF PRESIDENT
BIDEN. AS KAMALA HARRIS TRIES TO RE ENERGIZE THE CAMPAIGN THE SPOTLIGHT WILL TURN TO PLATFORMS LIKE THE SHADE ROOM
AND ITS MASSIVE AUDIENCE. >> EVEN JUST THE FACT THAT WE ARE A PART OF THE PRESS CORPS.
THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE OPENED
THE DOORS TO THE SHADE ROOM AND
PLATFORMS LIKE IT SHOWS YOU THEY UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF THE BLACK VOTE. >> WE ASK THE SAME ROOM ABOUT HOW THEY WILL COVER KAMALA HARRIS'S CAMPAIGN NOW THAT SHE HAS DECLARED? IN A STATEMENT THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO COVER HER SPEAKING
ENGAGEMENTS, AUDIENCE AND CELEBRITY OPINIONS THAT -- IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE WILL DO
FOR THE OPPOSING CANDIDATE. COMING UP WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW,
WE TAKE YOU TO PARIS HOURS BEFORE IT KICKS OFF NEXT.
>>> EXCITEMENT REACHING A FEVER PITCH IN PARIS AND ACROSS THE WORLD LESS THAN 24 HOURS FROM
THE OLYMPIC OPENING CEREMONIES. FINAL PREPS WITH
REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES. MEANWHILE, AS THOUSANDS OF ATHLETES KEEP SETTLING INTO THE
VILLAGE SOME ARE REPORTING A SHORTAGE OF CERTAIN FOODS LIKE EGGS.
THE VILLAGE CATERERS SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO INCREASE VOLUME LEVELS TO SATISFY
ATHLETES.
ANYWAY, OUR CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT IS THERE FOR US.>> Reporter: WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE FOOD?
THEY NEED THEIR PROTEIN, THESE ATHLETES. THEY NEED THEIR EGGS. >> THEY SURE DO.
YOU MENTIONED THEY ARE NOT GETTING THEM. LISTEN, IT'S ALWAYS THE THING WITH THE OLYMPICS YOU DON'T EXPECT. WE TALK ABOUT WILL IT BE CLEAN
ENOUGH AND NOW WE GET THIS OTHER ISSUE, WHICH IS A FOOD SHORTAGE. AS YOU SAY OUR COLLEAGUES THAT
SKY NEWS SPOKE TO TAME GREAT BRITAIN. THEY WERE TOLD THERE IS AN
ISSUE. THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE SOMETHING OF A FOOD SHORTAGE AT THE ATHLETES VILLAGE.
CLEARLY IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EVERYTHING. I THINK ONE OF THE ASPECTS HERE IS THIS WHOLE TRYING TO DO
THINGS SUSTAINABLY AND TRYING TO GET THE FOOD IN LOCALLY IS NOT EASY. WE ALREADY SAW THE VIBE OF
SOCIAL MEDIA WITH ATHLETES ABOUT THOSE CARDBOARD BEDS. PEOPLE ARE KIND OF LAUGHING
ABOUT THEM. THAT WAS AN IDEA FOR SUSTAINABILITY. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAVE THE
PLANET. THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT ISN'T WORTH IT. >> CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS CASUAL DROP IN YOU HAVE A
FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON AND EVERYONE ELSE INVOLVED WITH THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND HOW THEY ARE FEELING AHEAD OF THE OPENING CEREMONY?
>> IT WITH ME AND A FEW HUNDRED OTHER PEOPLE. ALL OF THE MORE IMPORTANT THAN I AM.
IT WAS A SUSTAINABILITY SUMMIT TONIGHT TO PUT THE EMPHASIS
ONCE AGAIN ON THOSE ISSUES FOR
THE OLYMPICS. THE HEAD OF THE PARIS 2024 OLYMPICS WAS THERE. I MANAGED TO HAVE A QUICK WORD. I SIMPLY SAID HOW ARE YOU
FEELING? HE SAID I FEEL GREAT. THAT IS THE ATMOSPHERE YOU GET HERE DESPITE WHAT THEY ARE
TRYING TO PULL OFF TOMORROW, WHICH IS HISTORY MAKING. THE FIRST TIME OUTSIDE OF THE
STADIUM AS WE SAID AGAIN AND AGAIN. FRANKLY IT IS GOING TO BE AMAZING. DESPITE ALL OF THAT THE
ATMOSPHERE IS BUZZING AND PEOPLE SEEM RELAXED. AT THIS CONFERENCE THEY SEEMED RELAXED. THE PRESIDENT CAME AND GAVE A
SPEECH, CHATTED WITH PEOPLE. THINGS APPEAR TO BE GOING WELL.
>> I KNOW THE LAST TIME YOU AND I SPOKE WERE TALKING ABOUT IF THE MAYOR WAS GOING TO SWIM.
DID YOU EVER DO IT AS I CHALLENGED YOU TDO? >> I HAVEN'T DONE IT YET.
THANK YOU THOUGH. I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO BE HEALTHY FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.
I'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO. I AM NOT SAYING I AM MORE IMPORTANT IN THE ATHLETES
OBVIOUSLY. CLEARLY IT IS IMPORTANT THEY CAN SWIM SAFELY.
EVERYONE IS WONDERING IF IT'S GOING TO BE SAFE. >> MAYBE WHEN THE OLYMPICS IS ALL SAID AND DONE WE CAN SEE A
JUMP IN THE RIVER AS A CELEBRATORY END TO THE OLYMPICS. >> IT IS A DEAL.
>> OKAY. YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THAT IS A WRAP FOR THIS HOUR. COVERAGE PICKS UP RIGHT NOW.
