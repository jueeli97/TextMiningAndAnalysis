>>> NEW OPTIONS TO DIAGNOSE
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WILL COMING
TO DOCTORS OFFICES.
BLOOD TESTS ALLOW PRIMARY CARE
DOCTORS TO DETECT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MOST
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MOST
COMMON FORMS OF DEMENTIA.
GOOD MORNING, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE
ALZHEIMER'S.
A LOT ADVISER ON THIS.
WALK US THROUGH THE LATEST
RESEARCH.
HOW IS IS OUTPERFORMING CURRENT
TESTING OPTIONS?
>> EMILY, GOOD MORNING.
SOME BACKGROUND FOR PEOPLE.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S
DISEASE, WE TALK ABOUT THE
BUILDUP OF ABNORMAL PROTEINS.
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR
A WHILE NOW, HOW CAN WE PICK UP
ON THEM EARLIER THAN WE HAVE.
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN INTERVENE
EARLIER.
WHAT THESE TESTS ARE LOOKING
FOR ARE THE PROTEINS IN THE
BRAIN ASSOCIATED WITH
ALZHEIMER'S.
CAN WE FIND THEM IN THE BLOOD?
TO BE SEEN IN THE BRAIN, IT IS
AN EXTENSIVE TEST.
THIS IS NOW SHOWING 90%
ACCURACY.
REALLY, A LOT OF HOPE ON THE
RISE THERE.
>> THESE TESTS HAVE BEEN
APPROVED BY THE FDA.
A BIG QUESTION RIGHT NOW, WHAT
TESTS CAN WE TRUST?
>> THE GOLD STANDARD RIGHT NOW
IS THAT YOU SEE YOUR PRIMARY
CARE PHYSICIAN.
THERE CAN BE FURTHER TESTING.
IT IS HARD TO SAY IF THIS IS
THE GOLD STANDARD.
THIS CAN INCLUDE AN MRI OF THE
BRAIN.
OR WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST.
FOR NOW, WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS
HOW TO SCREEN PEOPLE LIKE
MAMMOGRAMS AND COLONOSCOPIES.
THEY CAN POTENTIALLY PICK UP ON
THIS DISEASE YEARS BEFORE WE
CAN NOW.
>> PATIENT TO PATIENT, WHO
SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT BE USING
THE BLOOD TEST?
>> THE BIG CAUTION RIGHT NOW IS
THAT SOME OF THESE TESTS CAN
GET THROUGH ONLINE OR A
PRESCRIPTION.
THEY ARE NOT COVERED BY
INSURANCE WE DO NOT WANT PEOPLE
WHO ARE RELATIVELY YOUNG
FINDING OUT MORE ANALOGIES AND
FREAKING OUT AND GETTING
ANXIOUS THAT LATER DOWN THE
LINE I MIGHT GET MEMORY LOSS.
THESE TESTS ARE NOT USED FOR
THAT.
