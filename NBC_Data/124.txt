RAINING MEDALS FOR TEAM USA. GOOD MORNING. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
I AM JOE FRYER. >>> WE BEGIN WITH BREAKING NEWS
OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST. THE ASSASSINATION THAT RAISES FEARS THE REGION WILL PLUNGE DEEPER INTO CRISIS. OVERNIGHT, HAMAS -- WAS KILLED
BY ISRAEL AND THE STRIKE ON HIS HOME IN TEHRAN. ISRAEL HAS NOT YET COMMENTED ON
THE ATTACK BUT IT PREVIOUSLY SAID IT WOULD TARGET HAMAS LEADERS. WHAT HAMAS AND IRAN ARE VOWING
TO RETALIATE. ONE OF THE MAIN NEGOTIATIONS
AND THE DEAL COULD BE IN DOUBT AFTER MEDIATOR CONDEMNED IS A
SAYING, QUOTE, UNDERMINES THE CHANCES OF PEACE. ON TUESDAY, ISRAEL CONFIRMED THAT ASSASSINATED A SENIOR HEZBOLLAH LEADER AND A STRIKE
OUTSIDE THE LEBANESE CAPITAL OF BEIRUT. REPORTS HER TWO CHILDREN AND I WANTED WERE ALSO KILLED. DOZENS WERE LEFT INJURED. THE
ATTACK WAS IN RETALIATION FOR A STRIKE IN THE ISRAELI CONTROL GOLAN HEIGHTS LAST WEEK. IT KILLED 12 PEOPLE.
>>> IN A FEW MOMENTS WE WILL SPEAK WITH OUR MILITARY ANALYSTS BUT FIRST LET'S GET TO OUR
INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT BRADLEY WHO JOINS US FROM BEIRUT. WE KNOW THE HUNT FOR HAMAS
LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR 10 MONTHS. WALK US THROUGH HOW THIS UNFOLDED AND THE REACTION WE
ARE GETTING FROM ACROSS THE REGION INCLUDING IRAN WHERE THIS HAPPENED. >> Reporter: WE HAVE HEARD FROM
THE IRANIANS AND THEY SAID THIS WAS A MISSILE THAT WAS FIRED FROM SOME SORT OF AIRBORNE
ENTITY, SOME SORT OF PLANE. OUTSIDE OF IRANIAN TERRITORY.
WHATEVER WAS CARRYING THIS MISSILE DID NOT ENTER INTO IRANIAN AIRSPACE. THIS IS ACCORDING TO -- EMERALDS
RETALIATE. WE HAVE BEEN HEARING A CHORUS OF COMBINATIONS THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST, CALLS FOR
ESSENTIALLY ISRAEL TO STEP BACK BUT ALSO CAUSE FOR -- THAT IS THIS IS AN INFLAMMATORY MOVE BY
THE ISRAELIS. THEY HAVE SAID THEY WILL BE HUNTING DOWN HAMAS LEADERS WHEREVER THEY CAN FIND THEM AND
KILLING THEM. THEY DID THE SAME THING BACK IN BEIRUT IN JANUARY. THERE WAS A SIMILAR ATTACK JUST
YESTERDAY THAT ASSASSINATED A HAMAS LEADER. AND THE ISRAELIS HAVE NOT SAID
IF THEY WERE BEHIND THAT ASSASSINATION, A TOP OFFICIAL IN THE CAPITAL OF IRAN, BUT
EVERYBODY IS PRETTY MUCH ASSURED THEY HAVE DONE THIS. THEY HAVE NOT DENIED IT AND IN
THE PAST THEY HAVE BEEN BEHIND SEVERAL ASSASSINATIONS OF TOP OFFICIALS AND TOP IRANIAN OFFICIALS AND SCIENTISTS IN IRAN
WHICH IS ENTIRELY FEASIBLE. WHETHER OR NOT THIS COMPLICATES NEGOTIATIONS OR CREATES A
REGIONWIDE WAR, THAT IS A CONCERN I WANT THAT AMERICAN DIPLOMATS ARE WATCHING CLOSELY.
>> I MEAN, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CEASE-FIRE DEAL. THE CEASE-FIRE TALKS. HOW DOES
HIS DEATH IMPACT HOPES FOR THE HOSTAGES? >> Reporter: WE HEARD FROM
ANTHONY BLINKEN IN SINGAPORE
AND HE SAID HE REFUSES TO SPECULATE ON HOW EVENTS IN GENERAL WILL AFFECT THE FUTURE. THAT IS A Y POSITION TO TAKE.
WE HAVE GOTTEN SOME SIGHTINGS THAT THIS WILL COMPLICATE THINGS. QATAR'S PRIME MINISTER CAME OUT
AND SAID IF THE ISRAELIS ARE BEHIND IT, HOW WAS THAT THEY CAN NEGOTIATE WITH THE ISRAELIS
IF THE ISRAELIS ARE KILLING TOP NEGOTIATORS? THIS IS BECAUSE QATAR HAS BEEN
HOSTING AND MEDIATING A LOT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN HAMAS
IN ISRAEL. SO FOR THEM, THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN PARTIES AND THEIR
NEGOTIATION. HE WAS PART OF ALL OF THIS.
THIS COULD COMPLICATE THINGS GOING FORWARD BUT THE COMPLICATION IS WHATEVER THE
RETALIATION IS BEEN HERE AND HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON, THEY ARE POISED AND READY TO RESPOND TO THAT ATTACK FROM YESTERDAY NOW
WE ARE HEARING THE IRANIANS ARE
VOWING TO RETALIATE AND HAMAS, OF COURSE, HAS REASON TO RETALIATE. THIS IS THE CIRCLE CLOSING IN
ON ISRAEL AS THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO OPEN A NEW FRONT ON THE NORTHERN BORDER. IN THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>> COLONEL, GOOD TO HAVE YOU
WITH US. MANY COUNTRIES, THIS COULD BE A DANGEROUS ESCALATION.
IT COULD JEOPARDIZE CEASE-FIRE TALKS. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS IMPACTING
THE WAR IN GAZA AND HOPES FOR A PEACE DEAL? >> THE CEASE-FIRE TALKS WILL BE ON HOLD FOR SURE.
THEY WERE RUNNING INTO PROBLEMS IN ANY CASE BECAUSE HAMAS WAS BEING -- ABOUT THE TERMS BUT
NEVERTHELESS, THIS WILL SLOW OR STOP COMPLETELY CEASE-FIRE TALKS.
THEY WERE MEDIATED BY THE UNITED STATES AND QATAR AND OTHERS. THAT WILL SLOW DOWN IF NOT
STOP. WITH RESPECT TO HEZBOLLAH, IN THE PAST, HEZBOLLAH'S RESPONSE
HAS BEEN TO FIRE A LARGE NUMBER OF ROCKETS FROM LEBANON INTO
ISRAEL. THEY DO HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF REACHING TEL AVIV AND OTHER
CITIES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HAS BELOW WILL RESPOND BY FIRING ROCKETS
INTO POPULATED AREAS FARTHER SOUTH FROM THE LEBANESE BORDER. IF THAT HAPPENS, WE CAN EXPECT
A SERIOUS ESCALATION IN THE CONFLICT. ISRAEL HAS PUT ITSELF IN A
DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE NETANYAHU'S STATEMENT WAS THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO DESTROY HAMAS
AS A MILITARY ENTITY COMPLETELY. DIFFICULT TO DO INSIDE GAZA.
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO DO WHEN YOU ARE THREATENED AS ISRAEL IS BY HEZBOLLAH IN THE NORTH AND
VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH AND OF COURSE, DANGEROUS ESCALATION WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF
FIGHTING WITH IRAN. >> LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED IN IRAN THAT TOOK PLACE ON IRANIAN SOIL. IRAN SAID IT WILL RETALIATE AND
DEFEND ITS TERRITORY INTEGRITY. DO YOU THINK THIS COULD LEAD TO
A RESURFACING OF THE BACK-AND- FORTH OF ATTACKS WE SAW BETWEEN ISRAEL AND IRAN BACK IN APRIL OR IS THIS SOMETHING BIGGER?
>> NOTHING CAN BE BIGGER THAN WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE BECAUSE
THAT HAD THE CAPABILITY OF ESCALATING INTO A REGIONAL CONFLICT. THIS WILL BE A STEP LEVEL
EFFORT WHICH MEANS WE CAN EXPECT HEZBOLLAH WILL FIRE A LARGE NUMBER OF ROCKETS AND HOW
ISRAEL RESPONDS, THAT WILL TELL THE DIFFERENCE. THAT WILL SPELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER
OR NOT IT WILL BE AFTER THAT OR
IF THERE WILL BE A DANGEROUS ESCALATION INCLUDING IRAN. WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT IRAN
SUPPORTS HEZBOLLAH COMPLETELY AND ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENS THAT HEZBOLLAH DOES IS SUPPLIED BY, SUPPORTED BY, IRAN.
SO, WATCH FOR ROCKETS. IF THERE IS A SLOWER RESPONSE
FROM ISRAEL AFTER THAT, THINGS WILL QUIET DOWN AND IT MAY VERY
WELL BE NEGOTIATIONS WILL CONTINUE ABOUT GAZA. BUT IF THERE -- IT IS POSSIBLE
IT COULD SPILL OVER QUICKLY AND IF IT DOES THEN ISRAEL WILL HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE
PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH. DON'T FORGET, ISRAEL HAD TO TAKE A LOT OF HIS TROOPS OUT OF GAZA BECAUSE IT COULD NOT
AFFORD TO HAVE THEM IN UNIFORM 200 THOUSAND ISRAELIS IN UNIFORM. THEY CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN.
THERE WILL BE A BIG ESCALATION PRACTICALLY IN THE NORTH. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>> LEADERS OF THE SECRET
SERVICE ARE STILL FACING TOUGH QUESTIONS FROM LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. ACTING DIRECTOR RONALD ROWE IS
FIELDING TOUGH QUESTIONS ON CAPITOL HILL AFTER HIS RED ASSESSOR RESIGNED.

WILL GET MERRICK GARLAND TO MAKE HIS FIRST COMMENTS ABOUT
THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP BUT HE SPOKE IN A DAY WHEN
LAWMAKERS EXPRESS OUTRAGE ABOUT THE SECURITY FAILURES. ARLEN SAID IT WAS A SCARY TREATY FAILURE AND SHARED THEIR OUTRAGE BUT WAS CONFIDENT THAT
THE SECRET SERVICE WOULD GET IT BACK TOGETHER AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG. HERE IS MORE.
17 DAYS AFTER FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SURVIVED AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT BY A GUNMAN ON A ROOFTOP A
REMARKABLE ADMISSION FROM THE ACTING SECRET NERVOUS DIRECTOR WHO SAYS HE WENT TO THE RALLY SITE. >> I LAID IN A PRONE POSITION
TO EVALUATE HIS LINE OF SIGHT. WHAT I SAW MADE ME ASHAMED. AS
A CAREER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND 25 YEAR VETERAN WITH THE SECRET SERVICE, I CANNOT DEFEND WHY THAT ROOF WAS NOT BETTER SECURE.
>> WE PRESS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN IT HE HEARD THE ACTING SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR
SAID HE WAS ASHAMED THAT ALMOST CAUSED THE FORMER PRESIDENT HIS LIFE.
AS THE TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED? >> THE ATTACK ON THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS A HEINOUS ATTACK
BUT NOT ONLY ON TRUMP BUT ON DEMOCRACY ITSELF.
>> HOW ALARMED ARE YOU THAT A 20-YEAR-OLD COULD GET A CLEAR SHOT 150 YARDS FROM A FORMER PRESIDENT?
>> THIS IS EXTREMELY ALARMING
AND WHY WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY IT HAPPENED AND MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. >> Reporter: IN A HEARING, THE
ACTING DESERT SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR WAS GRILLED BY LAWMAKERS. >> STOP INTERRUPTING ME.
YOU ARE BE REFUSING TO ANSWER CLEAR AND DIRECT QUESTIONS. >> Reporter: DEMANDING TO KNOW WHY NO ONE HAS BEEN FIRED YET.
>> WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW? >> WHAT I NEED TO KNOW IS
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. >> Reporter: HE ACKNOWLEDGE THE ATTEMPT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF AGENCIES HAD THAT
TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD HAVE REVEALED HE FLEW A DRONE OVERHEAD TWO HOURS BEFORE MR.
TRUMP SPOKE. >> I FEEL AS THOUGH WE COULD HAVE PERHAPS FOUND HIM.
WE COULD HAVE MAYBE STOPPED HIM. >> Reporter: THE DEPUTY FBI
DIRECTOR REVEALED THE DISCOVERY OF A SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT LINKED TO THE GUNMAN BUT NOT
YET VERIFIED. >> SOME OF THESE COMMENTS REFLECT ANTI-SEMITIC AND ANTI- IMMIGRATION THEMES AND
POLITICAL VIOLENCE FOR >> Reporter: WHILE TELLING US MORE ABOUT THE THREAT AGAINST
MR. TRUMP AND OTHER OFFICIALS. >> OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS MADE CLEAR WE BELIEVE THE IRANIANS ARE ATTEMPTING TO KILL OR INJURE FORMER HIGH
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE AND WE HAVE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS. I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN THE END OF THAT.
>> Reporter: HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE CALLED THE SCARY INCREASE IN VIOLENT THREATS TO PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND SAID THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS BROUGHT MORE THAN 700 CASES IN THE LAST
TWO YEARS AND NO SIGNS OF STOPPING. HE IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CLIMATE OF VIOLENT AND POLITICAL RHETORIC. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE APPRECIATE IT. >>> FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HEADS BACK TO PENNSYLVANIA FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AGAINST HIM. MR. TRUMPIST SAID A WHOLE CAMPAIGN EVENT AND HARRISBURG
WITH THOUSANDS EXPECTED TO ATTEND. THERE HAVE BEEN 18 DAYS SINCE
HE HELD A RALLY IN BUTLER RAY GUNMAN OPENED FIRE GRAZING HIS
EAR WITH A BULLET. ONE PERSON WAS KILLED TWO INJURED. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN
COVERING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND JOINS US NOW WITH THE LATEST. WHAT CAN WE EXPECT AT THE RALLY TONIGHT?
WE KNOW THEY ARE HAPPENING INDOORS AND OUT BUT WHAT IS THE SECURITY SITUATION? >> Reporter: A COUPLE THINGS. BEING INDOORS IS A SHIFT IN
MANY OF HIS RALLIES HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE. AND SECURITY DETAILS, THEY ARE
TRYING TO KEEP THAT CLOSE TO THE BEST, BUT THERE WILL BE
MORE SECURITY. GIVEN IT IS THE FIRST TIME IN PENNSYLVANIA SINCE THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, I EXPECT
THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS IT. WE WILL ALSO BE WATCHING FOR MESSAGING PIVOT ON VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS.
AT HIS LAST RALLY HE WAS VERY MUCH FOCUSED ALTHOUGH HE LEFT THE RACE BUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
IS TRYING OUT NEW ATTACK LINES ON HARRIS AND THE BORDER AND
HER TIME AS A PROSECUTOR. THESE ARE IMPORTANT POSITION FOR THE STRATEGY AND THE
CANDIDATE. >> TALK ABOUT JD VANCE. HE VISITED NEVADA YESTERDAY
CRITICIZING VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS. HE IS ALSO TALKING ABOUT HIS ROLLOUT AS MR. TRUMP'S RUNNING
MATE WHICH GOT OFF TO A ROUGH START. WHAT WE LEARNED?
>> Reporter: FIN GOMEZ CAUGHT UP TO HIM AND TALK TO HIM YESTERDAY AND VANCE TOLD HIM HE
DOES NOT FEEL HE DISAPPOINTED THE FORMER PRESIDENT. HE KNEW COMING OUT OF THE GATES THERE WOULD BE SOME POSITIVE
PRESS COVERAGE AND THEN THEY WOULD GO ON THE ATTACK.
-- OF WOMEN WHO DON'T HAVE CHILDREN REFERRING TO THEM AS
CHILDLESS CAT LADIES. OVER THE LAST WEEK, HARRIS'S CAMPAIGN HAS TRIED TO QUOTE TIM AS WEIRD BUT HE WAS ALSO ON THE
ATTACK. TAKE A LISTEN. >> WE FACE THE WORST BORDER
CRISIS IN AMERICAN HISTORY ON HER WATCH AND 3 1/2 YEARS, -- INVADED OUR COUNTRY.
LOYALTY IS SERVING IN THE MARINE CORPS AND SOMETHING I DID. LOYALTY IS TAKING A BULLET FOR THIS COUNTRY.
SOMETHING TRUMP DID. IF KAMALA HARRIS WANT TO TALK
ABOUT LOYALTY SHE SHOULD LOOK IN THE MIRROR.
>> Reporter: HE IS HEADED TO THE BORDER TOMORROW AND WILL RALLY WITH FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA, OVER THE WEEKEND.
>> IS FOR THEIR FORMER PRESIDENT, HE MADE A COMMENT ABOUT VP HARRIS SUGGESTING SHE COULD NOT STAND UP TO LEADERS
ON THE WORLD STAGE. HIS CAMPAIGN IS PLAYING DEFENSE. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US.
>> Reporter: HE SAID SHE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO STAND UP TO LEADERS ON THE WORLD SAFE BECAUSE OF HER APPEARANCE ADDING HE DOESN'T WANT TO SPELL
IT OUT BUT PEOPLE WOULD KNOW WHAT HE MEANT. THE ARE NOW RESPONDING AND A SPOKESPERSON SAYING HE WAS NOT
REFERRING TO RACE OR GENDER. WENT ON TO CRITICIZE HARRIS OVER HER RECORD ON IMMIGRATION AND OTHER ADMINISTRATION POLICY
SAYING SHE IS WEAK, DISHONEST AND DANGEROUS. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
>>> VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IS OFFICIALLY THE ONLY CANDIDATE SEEKING THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. BECAUSE THE KEY DEADLINE PASSED
LAST NIGHT WITH NO ONE ELSE QUALIFYING. THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE SAYS 99% OF DELEGATES SIGNED HARRIS'S

FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DEFENDING VANCE'S COMMENTS FROM 2021 CRITICAL OF DEMOCRATIC
LEADERS WHO ARE CHILDLESS CAT LADIES. REFERENCING VANCE'S RISE FROM POVERTY. >> SHE GREW UP IN A VERY
INTERESTING FAMILY SITUATION AND HE FEELS FAMILY IS GOOD. I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING
WRONG IN SAYING THAT. >> Reporter: PROJECT 2025 CALLED FOR AN OVERHAUL OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND HAS
STEPPED DOWN FOR THE GROUP -BASED ESCALATING DEMOCRATIC ATTACKS AND COMES AFTER TRUMP
SHARPLY CRITICIZED PROCTOR 2025 WHICH IS RUN BY A NUMBER OF HIS ALLIES. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAID REPORTS
A PROJECT 2025 DEMISE WOULD BE GREATLY WELCOMED. MEANWHILE, IN THE SUBURBS, KIM
LOUDERMILK WAS ANXIOUS WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE.
>> I WAS WORRIED IT WOULD BE HARD TO GET A CAMPAIGN TOGETHER. AND NOW I AM SUPER EXCITED.
>> Reporter: REPUBLICANS BLAME BIDEN AND HARRIS FOR HIGH PRICES.
>> EVERYTHING FROM GAS PRICES TO EGGS. THE COST OF LIVING.
EVERYTHING IS UP. >> THANKS TO PETER ALEXANDER.
WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IS RUNNING MATE CHOICE SOON. TWO SOURCES TELL NBC NEWS THEY WILL GO TO BATTLEGROUND STATES
TOGETHER BEGINNING NEXT WEEK. >>> ON THE WEST COAST, CALIFORNIA'S PARK FIRE GREW OVERNIGHT AND IS NOW THE FIFTH
LARGEST WILDFIRE IN THAT STATE'S HISTORY.
THAT MIGHT BE THE BIGGEST FIRE BUT IT IS FAR FROM THE ONLY ONE. OFFICIALS ACROSS WAS REPORTED 89 LARGE ACTIVE WILDFIRES NBC
NEWS CORRESPONDENT STEVE PATTERSON JOINS US NOW NORTH OF SACRAMENTO WITH THE LATEST.
OVERNIGHT, THE FIRE CONTINUED TO GROW. HOW BIG IS IT NOW AND ARE THEY
CLOSER TO GETTING A HANDLE ON IT >> Reporter: THE FIRE SEEMINGLY NEVER STOPS GROWING HERE. MORE THAN 380,000 ACRES, IF YOU
CAN PICTURE, IT IS LARGER THAN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. IT IS HALF THE SIZE OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND.
THAT ENTIRE CIRCUMFERENCE DOES NOT LITERALLY BE ON FIRE AS WE SPEAK FIREFIGHTERS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OF PUSHING IT INTO A
WORSTED AREA HOPING IT LAYS DOWN AND BURNS OUT AND IT DIES AWAY BUT OFFICIALS ESTIMATE
THAT COULD TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS. SEVERAL RINGS BEFORE THAT
HAPPENS. IN THE MEANTIME, THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO PUSH IT AWAY CITIES AND THEY DON'T A GOOD
JOB. 18% CONTAINMENT AND THAT NUMBER GOES UP WITH A LONG --
FIREFIGHTERS WORKING AS HARD AS I CAN AROUND THE CLOCK TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY LIVE. MOST OF THE EVACUATION ALERTS
ARE NOW WARNINGS AND NOT ORDERS AND EVEN SOME OF THOSE ORDERS
AND WARNINGS HAVE LIFTED SINCE WE HAVE BEEN HERE ON THE GROUND IT FIREFIGHTERS DOING THE BEST THEY CAN, BUT THERE IS MORE
HOT, DRY, WINDY WEATHER IN THE FORECAST. WE CAN'T REACH TRIPLE DIGITS AS EARLY AS TODAY OR TOMORROW AND
THAT COMPLICATES EVERYTHING GOING ON HERE. >> EVERY FIRE PRESENTS ITS OWN CHALLENGE.
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE HERE? AND ARE THEY HELPING RESIDENTS EVACUATE OR IS THAT BEHIND US?
>> Reporter: THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STILL
IMPACTED AND AFFECTED BY THE IMMEDIATE THREAT OF FIRE. IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE
AT A HAIR'S BREATH AT ALL-TIME.
IF THIS WERE TO EXPLODE AGAIN IN ANOTHER DIRECTION, THAT IS ALWAYS A DANGER AND IT'S A
DANGER EVERYWHERE WHEN YOU ARE NEXT TO A FIRE ZONE LIKE THIS.
OTHER PLACES ARE HARDER TO DEAL WITH THAN OTHERS, OF COURSE. BUT FOR THE MOST PART, FIREFIGHTERS HAVE A GOOD HANDLE
ON KEEPING IT BACK AND AWAY FROM WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING. THEY ARE TRYING TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN OF THAT.
THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN THE TERRAIN. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO PUSH IT INTO AN AREA OF
FOREST DID. INTO AN AREA THAT HAS HILLSIDES AND CLIFF SIDES. YOU HAVE TO MAKE PRECISE
AIRDROPS IF YOU HAVE AN AIR GAME, SO TO SPEAK.
IF NOT, HANG CREWS HAVE TO DO IT
IN THE NETWORK OF HILLS AND KEEP THE FIRE CONTAIN. THAT IS THE BIG DEAL AND THE OTHER THING IS THE THING I
MENTIONED. IF THIS HEATS UP AGAIN, IT IS MISERABLE TO PUT OUT A FIRE WHEN YOU HAVE 100 PLUS DEGREE
TEMPERATURES. OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE GOT GEAR THAT
THE GUYS ARE WEARING DOING THE WORK. >> THERE ARE DOZENS OF FIRES BURNING OUT WEST RIGHT NOW.
HOW IS THAT IMPACTING THE CREWS WHICH ARE STRETCHED US IN THIS TIME OF YEAR? >> Reporter: 5000 FIREFIGHTERS ON THIS FIRE ALONE. THE
RESOURCES TO COMBAT THESE THINGS IS ENORMOUS. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING 24, 36, 28 HOUR SHIFTS.
THEY ARE EXHAUSTED AND HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR WEEKS.
WE ARE STILL EARLY IN THE FIREFIGHTING SEASON IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE COME FALL. IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF WORK
HERE. >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COVERAGE. PLEASE CONTINUE TO STAY SAFE.
>>> LET'S TURN TO ANGIE LASSMAN FOR A CHECK ON THE WEATHER. >>> WE'VE GOT THAT HE DID TALK ABOUT NOT JUST FOR PARTS OF THE
WEST BUT A GOOD CHUNK OF THE COUNTRY. WE HAVE EXPANDED ALERTS AS THE
MORNING HAS GONE ON INCLUDING MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS LIKE NEW YORK CITY, MIAMI, OKLAHOMA
AND OUT WEST WE HAVE SOME AND THOSE ARE LIKELY LASTING FOR
THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE THE GREATEST HEAT AND HUMIDITY IS CENTERED RIGHT NOW.
SPECIFICALLY ACROSS PARTS OF THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY. WICHITA IS EXPECTED TO HIT 103 TODAY.
ST. LOUIS IN THE HIGH 90s BUT FEELING LIKE 110. CHICAGO, UPPER 80s, NOT ABOUT
ACTUAL TEMPERATURE, BUT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE IT WILL BE CLOSER TO THE 90s.
THE FURTHER SOUTH YOU GO, TRIPLE DIGITS FOR WASHINGTON AND FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURES, JUST TODAY, WE WRAP UP JULY FEELING
LIKE SUMMER AND GO INTO AUGUST WITH MUCH OF THE SAME. THIS GOES OUT WEST AS WELL. SALT LAKE CITY 99 DEGREES.
ST. LOUIS 98 DEGREES. 108 IN CHARLOTTE TOMORROW. NEW YORK CITY LOW 90s BUT
FEELING NEAR 100 AS WE GET INTO TOMORROW. THIS WEEKEND, DEALING WITH THE
HEAT WAVE ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS PARTS OF
THE ROCKIES. 100 DEGREES FRIDAY AND SATURDAY IN SALT LAKE CITY. SIMILAR STORY FOR OKLAHOMA CITY.
INTO THE TRIPLE DIGIT FRIDAY, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY YOU ARE NEAR TRIPLE DIGITS.
MEMPHIS 97 AND 94 ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE AS MANY
BUYER ALERTS IN PLACE RIGHT NOW BUT THERE ARE STILL OUT THERE.
THE FIRE WEATHER WATCH BOARD FOR PARTS OF CALIFORNIA AND OREGON, WE HAVE ELEVATED WINDS
AND A LOW LEVEL OF HUMIDITY. CONDITIONS AND WARM
TEMPERATURES BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR ALERTS. WE HAVE A LOT OF SMOKE WE ARE DEALING WITH THE POOR AIR
QUALITY WILL BE SOMETHING THAT STICKS WITH US TODAY LETTING INTO THIS EVENING. MAYBE TOMORROW. WE WILL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT.
YOU WILL NOTICE A BIT OF A HAZE AND IF YOU HAVE RESPIRATORY ISSUES, THAT IS SOMETHING TO
TAKE NOTE OF FOR SURE. >> THAT IS ONE OF THE IMPACTS OF ALL THESE FIRES. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

OUR EXPERT ON ALL THINGS INFLATION IS CALEB SILVER WHO
IS JOINING US NOW. WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING? WHAT ARE THE ODDS WE SEE A RATE
CUT THIS TIME AROUND? >> LESS THAN 3%. YOU WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO WAIT
FOR THE MEETING ON SEPTEMBER 18th. THAT IS WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN SIGNALING THEY WILL LOWER
INTEREST RATES. THEY HAVE BEEN WATCHING INFLATION VERY CLOSELY.
WE ARE ALSO WATCHING THE LABOR MARKET. INFLATION AND FULL EMPLOYMENT
BOTH ARE STEADY RIGHT NOW. THE DATA LOOKS GOOD AND THEY
ARE GETTING READY AND CLOSER BUT THEY ARE HOPING HE WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR A RATE CUT
IN SEPTEMBER. >> THAT IS THE KEY. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO.
>> WORDS MATTER AND WE TAKE THEM VERY SERIOUSLY.
MAYBE THEY ARE USING A DIFFERENT NOUN ARE TALKING ABOUT A COOLING OR PROGRESS ON
INFLATION, THINGS LIKE THAT, WILL MAKE IT STRONGER. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR THIS.
INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN HIGH AND THEY CUT THEM THE LAST TIME
ABOUT A YEAR AGO. >> THEY ARE TRYING TO CONTROL INFLATION WITHOUT DIPPING US
INTO A RECESSION. ARE THEY WORRIED THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DROPPING THE
INTEREST RATE SOONER? >> THERE ARE TWO CAMPS ON THAT. AS OF THE LAST GDP REPORT, THE
ECONOMY IS GROWING AT 2.8%. IT WILL SLOW.
KNOW THAT. IT'S LIKE A HOT AIR BALLOON. IF THEY CUT RATES NOW, AND
MIKE'S BLAKE -- MIGHT SPIKE INFLATION AGAIN. IF THEY WAIT AND WATCH THE DATA
AND CUT IN SEPTEMBER THEY MAY GET A SOFT LANDING. IT JUST DEPENDS. >> IF THE CUT IS IN SEPTEMBER,
WHAT IS THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT AMERICANS WILL SEE?
>> LOWER INTEREST RATES DON'T MEAN LOWER PRICES. IT JUST MEANS THE COST OF MONEY
IS . YOU MAY SEE MORTGAGE RATES COME DOWN. RIGHT NOW THEY ARE AT 7.5%. NEW CAR LOANS AND CREDIT CARD
COULD COME DOWN. AT THE SAME TIME, THE MONEY IN THE BANK WILL COME DOWN.
THERE IS A SEESAW THERE. >> INFLATION RIGHT NOW IS
HOVERING AROUND 3%. THE GOAL IS TO GET TO 2%. IS THAT EVEN A POSSIBILITY?
>> PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT IS AN IMPOSSIBLE TARGET.
YOU WANT A LITTLE INFLATION. WE NEED THAT BUT WE DON'T WANT TOO MUCH.
HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE SOME SICKNESS TODAY THAT WE ARE IN THE RIGHT GOLDILOCKS AREA. >> THANK YOU BEST.

ITALY'S SHRINKAGE. IT DELAYS

THE NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REMOVE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. BY THE GOVERNOR SAYS IT
NECESSARY, AND HOW CRITICIZING IT WILL ONLY MAKE FOR THE GENER NOW IS NBC NEWS NOW.
>>> WELCOME BACK. CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR HAS A NEW SOME HAS ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE
ORDER DIRECTING STATE AGENCIES TO REMOVE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS FROM PUBLIC PROPERTY.
HE SAYS THE MOVE IS IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATE IT COULD CAUSE EVEN MORE DAMAGE TO AN ALREADY
VULNERABLE POPULATION. FOR MORE LET'S BRING IN DONALD
WHITEHEAD, THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COALITION FOR THE HOMELESS. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AN ISSUE THEY HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH FOR A LONG TIME.
WHAT ARE YOUR MAIN CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THESE ENCAMPMENTS ONCE THEY ARE REMOVED?
>> SURE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE.
THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT I THINK HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS FOR
PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT DOES NOTHING TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS,
SAFETY ISSUES, OR ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN TO THE PEOPLE IN THE ENCAMPMENTS. WHEN YOU MOVE PEOPLE FREQUENTLY
FROM ENCAMPMENT TO ENCAMPMENT, IT DOES NOT SOLVE THEIR HOMELESSNESS AND MAKES IT WORSE.
IT MAKES THE PATH OUT OF HOMELESS IS HARDER. I THINK IT IS GIVEN BY THE
BELIEF THAT PEOPLE SOMEHOW WANT TO BE IN THIS CONDITION. PEOPLE ARE FORCED INTO HOMELESSNESS AND THIS IS NOT
ADDRESS ANY OF THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES. >> GAVIN NEWSOM SAID HE ISSUED THE ORDER BECAUSE THE CAMPS CAN
BLACK ELECTRICITY AND RUNNING WATER AND POSE A HAZARD.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS? >> WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE IN SHELTERS, EITHER. OR WE DON'T MEET PEOPLE IN
ENCAMPMENTS, EITHER. ENCAMPMENTS ARE NOT IN ANY WAY
A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THE RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING ON THE
GROUND AND SLEEPING IN TENTS. THEY ARE NOT SAFE AND THERE ARE
NO LOCKS ON THEIR DOORS. WE ARE NOT IN ANY WAY PROMOTING ENCAMPMENTS. WHILE WE ARE SAYING IS THE
SOLUTION TO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS AND ENCAMPMENTS IT TO DO IT IN
A HUMANE WAY THAT INVOLVES PERMANENT HOUSING, OR TEMPORARY
SHELTER BUT MOVING PEOPLE INTO A FACILITY WHETHER IT IS
PERMANENT HOUSING OR SHELTER, PRIOR TO SWEEPING THEM AWAY BECAUSE WHEN YOU SWEEP THEM
AWAY, YOU DON'T HAVE A DESTINATION AND THEY ARE STILL OUTSIDE AND STILL HOMELESS. IF YOU DON'T ADDRESS THE SAFETY
ISSUES, IT WILL BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO CRIMINALIZE PEACE PEOPLE AND PUT THEM IN JAIL
THAN IT IS TO PUT HOUSING OR SERVICES WHICH IS HOW WE SOLVE
HOMELESSNESS. THAT APPROACH IS EFFECTIVE 90% OF THE TIME.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE WHICH IS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND A NUMBER OF
ISSUES. THE CALIFORNIA SAID IT SAID 20% OF THE POPULATION LIVED IN THE
GOLDEN STATE AND I USED TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND I SAW IT
WITHIN BLOCKS OF WARILY. WHY IS IT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ARE EXPERIENCING
HOMELESSNESS? >> I WILL NEXT JUST READING HOMELESSNESS IS A HOUSING
CRISIS. THE NUMBER ONE REASON, IT IS VERY COMPLEX AS YOU SAID, BUT
THE NUMBER ONE REASON IS THE BLACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR.
THERE ARE DRAMATICALLY INCREASING HOUSING COSTS AND LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ONLY A QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING
WHERE THEY COULD GET SUPPORT IF THEY CANNOT PAY FOR THE HOUSING
THEMSELVES ONLY ONE QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE ELIGIBLE ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE HOUSING BECAUSE OF
BLACK OF UNITS. WE SAW 12% INCREASE IN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND ALSO SAW
AN 18% YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN HOUSING COSTS.
IT IS A HOUSING ISSUE. WE HAVE TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION IN
THIS COUNTRY OR WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THE NUMBERS RISE.
AN INTERESTING FACT ABOUT LOS ANGELES, THE HOMELESS SYSTEM WILL HOUSE OVER 700 PEOPLE A YEAR BUT WITHIN THE NEXT 700
WILL SHOW. WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE WAGES OR ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND
THAT'S AN ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA. ALL OF THESE THINGS MAKE FOR A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE, AS YOU SAID, AND MY SOLUTIONS, QUICK FIX
SOLUTIONS LIKE DO NOTHING BUT MAKE THE ISSUERS. >> AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.
WE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO TALK WITH US THIS MORNING. >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND PLEASE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT
THIS ISSUE. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. >>> LET'S GET TO SOME MONEY NEWS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS EYEING
A TICKET TAKE WITH A NEW LAWSUIT AGAINST STUB HUB. WE HAVE THAT AND OTHER MONEY HEADLINES. >>> STUB HUB IS BEING SUED BY
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF WASHINGTON, D.C. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES THE PLATFORM USES
DECEPTIVE ADS FOR THE TICKET PRICES TO CONSUMERS WHO END UP PAYING A LOT MORE AT CHECKOUT.
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS STUB HUB IS INTENTIONALLY HIDING THE TRUE PRICE AND USERS -- TO
CREATE A FALSE SENSE OF URGENCY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CRACKING DOWN ON TICKET SERVICES
AND THE FEES THEY CHARGE EVER SINCE THE TAYLOR SWIFT TICKETMASTER FIESTA AND 2022.
>>> OPENAI HAS STARTED ROLLING OUT THE ADVANCED VOICE MODE TO A PHONE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO
SUBSCRIBE TO THE SERVICE. CHATGPT PLUS, THAT SHOWED UP IN
MAY AND WAS CRITICIZED FOR SOUNDING TOO SIMILAR TO SCARLETT JOHANSSON FROM HER ROLE IN THE MOVIE HER.
IT WAS LATER DELAYED BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY CALL SAFETY REASONS. IT NOW ONLY USES -- GET READY

IT WILL SEND A RESPONSE BY TEXT OR A MESSAGE SUCH AS, WISHING
YOU GOOD LUCK AT A JOB INTERVIEW. YOU CAN PREORDER IT AND EXPECTED TO SHIP IN JANUARY.
WHAT COULD GO WRONG, RIGHT? >> RIGHT.
THAT'S LIKE THE BEGINNING OF A SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE. THANK YOU FOR >>> IT IS A COMEBACK WE HAVE
BEEN WAITING FOR. SIMONE BILES BACK ON TOP AND NOW THE MOST DECORATED GYMNAST
OF ALL TIME. UP NEXT, WE WILL TAKE YOU TO PARIS FOR HER TRIUMPHANT RETURN
>>> AND OFFICIALLY WINNING THE MOST OLYMPIC MEDALS FOR U.S.
GYMNASTICS EVER.
-- IS LIKE FOR US IN PARIS WITH ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM A THRILLING DAY AT THE SUMMER GAMES. WHAT A WIN FOR WOMEN GYMNASTICS.
WE KNOW THEY WERE THE FAVORITES, BUT WE ALSO REMEMBERED WHAT HAPPENED THREE YEARS AGO. YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH IT MEANT
TO EACH ONE OF THEM, BUT ALSO THE FANS. [ INAUDIBLE ] >> YOUR DESCRIPTION -- THIS WAS
WEIGHING ON THE. CAN TELL IN HERE AFTERWORDS WHEN THEY WERE EXCITED ABOUT THE WIN. THEY WERE CLOSE THAT SO COMING
HERE TO GO TO THE TOP OF THE PODIUM, THEY DID JUST THAT. THERE WERE SOME ISSUES AND
ERRORS. [ INAUDIBLE ] WHAT CAN YOU SAY?
NOT ONLY DOES SHE HAVE AS MANY OLYMPIC GYMNASTIC MEDALS AS
ANYONE IN THE HISTORY OF THE U.S., SHE HAS MORE WORLD MEDALS AND GYMNASTIC THAN ANYONE. ANYONE WHO EVER
COMPETED IN THE SPORT. SHE IS FAR AND AWAY -- SHE IS
THE BEST BENZ EVER DONE OF THIS. AND IT WAS SO FANTASTIC TO SEE HER SMILING SO BIG, BEAMING
AFTER THE COMPETITION. THEY REALLY CRUSHED THE REST OF -- THEY WERE VERY STRONG AND
VERY HAPPY AND EXCITED AFTERWORD. IT WAS A SPECIAL MOMENT. ONE THAT THAT WILL MARK A KEY
MOMENT IN THESE GAMES. >> SIMONE IS NOT DONE YET. [ INAUDIBLE ] THE RUGBY SEVEN
TEAM, MAYBE THE MOST THRILLING VICTORY OF THE DAY.
TIME EXPIRED TO WIN THE FIRST MEDAL AT THE OLYMPICS. TALK ABOUT THIS WINNING MOMENT.
>> UNBELIEVABLE, WHEN YOU SAW THE SEVENS OUT THERE. THIS IS A SPORT WE ARE WE NEVER
BEEN UNTIL THESE WOMEN COMPETED -- THEY LOST, AND THEY CAME BACK
, FACING AUSTRALIA. [ INAUDIBLE ] IT WAS A BACK-AND-
FORTH, TOUCH MATCHUP AS YOU SAID. ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD DASH. ALL OF THOSE WOMEN
AFTERWORDS, SO EMOTIONAL.
THEY HAD GIVEN UP EVERYTHING THEY HAD. MOST OF THEM CRYING AS WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HAPPY THEY WERE TO REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY AND BE A PART OF A VERY SPECIAL
WIN. THE FIRST EVER IN RUGBY AND U.S. OLYMPIC HISTORY. >> -- WE DO NOT LET YOU SLEEP.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR TO MOST? >> ONE OF THE THINGS -- IT'S
COOL TO SEE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAMS COME TOGETHER. THEY HAVE NOT REALLY WORKED TOGETHER VERY MUCH.
SO I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE THEM ON THE COURT. -- THEY ARE PLAYING SOUTH SUDAN.
THAT SHOULD NOT BE TOO DIFFICULT OF A MATCH. THEY SHOULD GET THAT DONE PRETTY EASILY. ONE -- I AM
LOOKING FOR TO -- I THINK IT WILL BE A SPECIAL NIGHT IN THE
POOL FOR USA SWIMMING. WE WILL SEE SOME REAL ACTION THERE. WE'LL SEE KATIE LEDECKY, LOOKING TO WIN HER EIGHTH GOLD.
THAT WOULD BE THE MOST FOR ANY SWIMMER IN THE U.S. HISTORY. [ INAUDIBLE ] YOU MIGHT BE ABLE
TO TELL I'M A LITTLE BIT INTO THE SWIM THING. THE KEY TO SWIMMING, OBVIOUSLY,
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO REDUCE DRAG. I CAN PROMISE YOU, THESE CAPS AND GOGGLES ARE.
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS THE COMPETITION SUIT THAT THEY WILL WEAR.
THIS IS JUST LIKE THE ONE KATIE LEDECKY WHERE. 40 MINUTES FOR SWIMMER TO WAKE -- WORK THE WAY INTO THE.
IT IS TO SURMISE US -- IT IS
TWO SIZES SMALLER THAN THE ONE THEY WEAR AND PRACTICE. THEY WEAR IT ONLY ONCE.
ONE RACE AND IT IS GONE. THIS LITTLE SUIT -- I STRESS,
LITTLE, $600. $600 EACH RACE TO GET INTO THE SUPERIOR [ INAUDIBLE ]
>> I AM DISAPPOINTED YOU DID
NOT TRY TO SLIP THAT ON WHILE THE VIDEO WAS ROLLING AND COME BACK WITH THE WHOLE OUTFIT ON. >> NO ONE IS DISAPPOINTED I DID
NOT TRY THIS ON. NO ONE IN THE FREE WORLD IS DISAPPOINTED. >> [ INAUDIBLE ] THE SWIMMING
TEAM. THE ENTHUSIASM AROUND THEM AND
ALL OF THE EVENTS AND HOW THEY ARE CONSTANTLY CONTENDERS AND EVERYTHING. TELL US MORE ABOUT WHAT WE CAN SEE AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
TO. >> IT IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST TICKET IN TOWN, OBVIOUSLY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ENJOYING A. IT'S COOL TO BE IN THE ARENA AND SEEING PEOPLE CHEERING FOR
COUNTRIES -- I THINK WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS, NOT ONLY
MINING MEDALS . BUT ALSO, I
THINK ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS IS HOW TIGHT AND CLOSE THESE RACES HAVE BEEN.
[ INAUDIBLE ] KATIE LEDECKY IN
THE QUALIFIER FOR HER EVENT TONIGHT FINISHED 17 SECONDS --
THAT WAS AWKWARDLY WEIRD THAT SHE WAS THAT MUCH BETTER. BUT OTHERWISE, [ INAUDIBLE ] I
WILL TELL YOU WHAT, I AM DIZZY AND SEEING SPOTS BECAUSE OF THIS CAP. IS GETTING A LITTLE CONFUSING.

PARTS OF OMAHA, SIOUX FALLS, MINNESOTA, THE GREATEST RISK ENHANCED RISK AREA BUT THIS EXTENDS TO PARTS OF THE
SOUTHEAST, TENNESSEE VALLEY, INDIANAPOLIS, CINCINNATI MINNEAPOLIS, HAVE THE THREAT FOR WIND GUSTS, THE MAIN THREAT THIS

MINNEAPOLIS, INCLUDING DES MOINES, SPRINGFIELD, WE AR GOING TO WATCH FOR POTENTIAL FOR FLASH FLOODING ACROSS THIS ARE TOO, WITH AMPLE AMOUNTS OF RAI
ON THE WAY, WE COULD SEE PERIODS OF REALLY HEAVY RAIN IN THES AREAS. I THINK WHEN IT IS ALL SAID AN
DONE, MAYBE HIGHER AMOUNTS CLOSER TO TWO OR THREE INCHES OF RAIN, BUT IF WE HAVE ALREADY GOT
SATURATED GROUNDS, EVEN ACROSS PARTS OF VERMONT, NOT GOING TO TAKE MUCH FOR FOLKS TO SEE FLOODING THERE NOW, BIG PICTURE LOOK OF THE

GOOD MORNING. >> THAT'S RIGHT, WE START AND
UKRAINE WERE RUSSIA UNLOADED A BARRAGE OF DRONES IN KYIV AND WHAT'S CALLED ONE OF THE LARGEST DRONE ATTACKS THE
COUNTRY SEEN SINCE THE WAR BEGAN. FULL SCALE OF THE ATTACK IS NOT CLEAR BUT THE MAYOR SAYS IT CAME FROM ALL DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS. RUSSIA STATE MEDIA SAID THE ATTACKS TARGETED MILITARY WAREHOUSES.
IN VENEZUELA, IT CONTINUES FOR A SECOND DAY WITH PEOPLE
OPPOSING A DISPUTED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. PRESIDENT MADURO WAS SAID TO HAVE WON BUT NOW THEY'RE ISSUING WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE
HARSHEST REBUKE YET SAYING UNABLE TO VERIFY THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION AND SAYS THERE WAS
A COMPLETE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. FINALLY TO A ROBOT DOG THAT
PICKED UP TRASH WITH ITS FEET. HE WANTS TO PICK UP THINGS LIKE CIGARETTE BUTTS ON A BEACH.
YOU GET A ROBOT TO DO IT. THE ITALIAN SCIENTIST DID IT
AND THEY USED A THING TO TRAIN IT TO PICK UP TRASH. THIS IS ONE STOP IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION. >>> COMING UP.
I PROMISE TO CHANGE BACK TO MY NORMAL CODE. MAYBE YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE RUST BELT? WHAT ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA'S SO
CALLED LATINO BELT. A MAJOR VOTING BLOCK THERE, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE
VICE PRESIDENT SELECT.
>>> AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HEADING TO HARRISBURG,
PENNSYLVANIA, TONIGHT FOR HIS FIRST RALLY IN THAT STATE SINCE HIS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT THIS
MONTH IN BUTLER. BOTH THE TRUMP AND TERRORISTS CAMPAIGNS ARE LOOKING TO COURT
VOTERS IN THE SO-CALLED LATINO BELT. PENNSYLVANIA PUP PRESIDENT BIDEN OVER-THE-TOP AND EXPECTED TO PLAY A BIG ROLE IN THIS
YOUR'S ELECTION. CORRESPONDENT GEORGE SOLIS JOINS US WITH MORE ON THIS.
GOOD MORNING. >> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. PENNSYLVANIA IS HOME TO MORE
THAN 100 -- 1 MILLION LATINOS AND THOSE REGISTERED TO VOTE, THAT'S IN THE SIX FIGURES.
BUT CAMPAIGNS NOTES IN IMPORTANT VOTING BLOCK. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN OPENING AN OFFICE RIGHT BEHIND ME.
THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN HAS 24 CAMPAIGN OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE COMMONWEALTH. IN THIS HEATED BATTLE FOR THE STATE AND PRESIDENCY, BUT
CAMPAIGNS NO VOTERS HERE COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. IN MAJORITY LATINO, READING,
PENNSYLVANIA, SAMUEL AND DAVID SAY THE TALK OF THE TOWN'S POLITICS.
>> IT'S EXCITING. IT'S AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE. >> Reporter: DO YOU CARE MORE
ABOUT THE ELECTION NOW? >> I DO. >> Reporter: WE FIRST MET THEM OF DOMINICAN DEFENSE BEFORE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SURVIVED
AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT TO PICK J.D. VANCE AS HIS RUNNING MATE. HARRIS ROSE TO THE TOP OF THE TICKET.
BOTH REMAIN FIRMLY UNDECIDED, BUT NEWLY ENERGIZED. >> SHE HAS DIRECTION.
I THINK IT EVENS THE PLAYING FIELD. >> WILL SHE ADVANCED THE COUNTRY, POSSIBILITY SHE TAKES
IT AND REFERS? WE DON'T KNOW. >> Reporter: THIS 18-YEAR-OLD, STUDENT AT THE BARBERSHOP SAYS
HE WILL VOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME. HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT POSSIBLY VOTING FOR EITHER ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES? >> IN MY OPINION, KIND OF NERVOUS.
>> Reporter: ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE HISPANICS WERE VOTE IN THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
THIS YEAR. READING IN THOSE SO-CALLED LATINO BELT. CITIES AND SMALL TOWNS ONCE
DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLDS NESTLED IN NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA.
IN THIS REGION, LATINO COMMUNITIES MAKE UP 9% OF THE STATE'S OVERALL POPULATION.
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE BOTH CAMPAIGNS ARE TRYING TO EARN YOUR? >> DEFINITELY. >> Reporter: BIND WON BY 80,000 VOTES IN 2020.
THAT YEAR, MORE THAN 610,000 LATINOS WERE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. WHILE MR. BIDEN ONE GO READYIN
, THE CITY SHIFTED 15 POINTS TO THE RIGHT SINCE 2016.
RECENT POLLING SHOWS HARRIS PERFORMING BETTER THAN BIDEN VERSUS TRUMP AMONG LATINO VOTERS. IN 2020, WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR? >> ITEM.
>> Reporter: SHE EXPLAINED THAT SHE IS SWITCHING TO TRUMP IN
2024. FRUSTRATED BY THE RISING COST OF LIVING.
BY'S ENDORSEMENT APPEARS ONLY PUSHING HER FURTHER AWAY. SHE VOLUNTEERS AT THE RECENTLY OPEN TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICE. >> I DON'T TRUST HER. >> Reporter: WHY?
>> BECAUSE HER BACKGROUND. I DON'T TRUST HER. >> Reporter: TONYA THINKS
PUTTING PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO WON THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
DOES SHE NEED JOSH SHAPIRO TO SECURE THE WHITE HOUSE? >> PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INVESTED
IN THE ELECTION WILL TEND TO FOLLOW SOMEBODY THEY TRUST. >> Reporter: HER MOVE FROM PUERTO RICO WHEN SHE WAS 14.
SHE WILL VOTE HARRIS IN NOVEMBER AND THE VP VISIT LEAVING A LASTING IMPACT. >> SHE CAME IN THE CITY TO TALK
TO PEOPLE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THAT WAS THE MOST POSITIVE THING. >> Reporter: READING RESTAURANT OWNER RECALLS HARRIS'S TRIP BUT
HAS NOT BEEN SWEET, YET. >> LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. >> Reporter: WITH LESS THAN 100
DAYS, THE RESIDENTS ARE PAYING ATTENTION, FEEL THE WEIGHT OF
THE DECISION AHEAD. >> THINK OF WHAT YOU WANT FOR YOUR COUNTRY AND WHAT YOU WANT FOR THE KIDS. >> I WANT THEM TO SAY, THINGS
ARE DIFFERENT NOW THAN THEY WERE FOR MOM AND DAD. I AM SO HAPPY WE ARE IN THIS
COUNTRY. >> Reporter: YEAH, NEEDLESS TO
SAY COMING BACK AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED POST THE DEBATE, YOU CAN SEE OUT ENERGIZED THE VOTERS ARE.
WE REACHED OUT TO BOTH CAMPAIGNS AND THEY GAVE
DIFFERENT STATEMENTS ABOUT THEIR APPROACH TO THE LATINO VOTE. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON TELLING US THE PERCENTAGE OF HISPANIC CIVIL VOTE CAN TAKE THE ONE STATE TO ONE SIDE OR
THE OTHER.
THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL PLANS TO SEE THE TRUMP TICKET WILL COME TO READING BUT NO SPECIFIC TIME LINE ON WHEN THAT MIGHT HAVE A. THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN TELLING US
THE ENTHUSIASM WE'RE SEEING FOR VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE COUNTRY IS UNPRECEDENTED AND LATINOS ARE SHOWING UP IN HIGH NUMBERS TO SUPPORT HER CAMPAIGN.
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A LEADER WHO WILL PAY FOR THEM AND THE ISSUES THAT FAMILIES CARE ABOUT.
YOU CAN REALLY SEE BOTH CAMPAIGNS MAKING A PUSH FOR THE LATINO VOTE ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA. >> YOU SO MUCH. LET'S KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING. BRING IN POLITICAL
CORRESPONDENT STEVE KORNACKI AT THE BIG BOARD.
ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU. PENNSYLVANIA PUP PRESIDENT BIDEN OVER-THE-TOP OR HELPED PUT THEM OVER-THE-TOP IN THE
2020 ELECTION. REMIND US HOW CLOSE THIS STATE WAS FOUR YEARS AGO AND HOW CLOSE IT COULD BE THIS TIME. >> TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE.
THE RESULTS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE, A LITTLE MORE THAN 80,000.
THAT HAS BEEN'S MARGIN. ONE STEP BACK, REMEMBER WHEN TRUMP CARRY PENNSYLVANIA IN 2016.
THIS WAS HIS MARGIN. YOU CAN SEE IT WAS JUST OVER 40,000 VOTES.
THE LAST TWO COLLECTIONS, TRUMP OF 40,000 AND BIDEN BY 80,000. THAT'S THE RANGE WE'VE BEEN
WORKING IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES WHAT GEORGE WAS TALKING ABOUT SO CRUCIAL IN
TERMS OF HOW IT MIGHT PLAY OUT. THE THREE COUNTIES TALKING ABOUT
, THE CITIES WITH THE LARGEST HISPANIC POPULATIONS ARE RIGHT HERE. THIS IS WHERE READING IS, ALLENTOWN, AND THEN YOU HAVE
AZLE 10 APPEAR. BY PERCENTAGE, THESE THREE CITIES HAVE THE HIGHEST
HISPANIC SHARE IN THE STATE. AS GEORGE WAS SAYING, AS THE STATE WENT MORE BLUE IN 2020 TOWARD JOE BIDEN, THESE COUNTIES AND CITIES WENT MORE RED.
LET'S GIVE AN EXAMPLE. LOOK AT ALLENTOWN, LARGEST HISPANIC POPULATION BY SHARE OF
ANY CITY IN PENNSYLVANIA. YOU CAN SEE, MAJORITY HISPANIC AND THIS IS HOW THE VOTE IN
ALLENTOWN OVER THE LAST THREE CYCLES. DEMOCRATS BY 45, DEMOCRATS BY 42. 2020, DOWN TO 35. THE POPULATION OF HISPANICS HAS
BEEN GETTING LARGER AND ALLENTOWN AND DEMOCRATIC VOTE SHARE HAS BEEN COMING DOWN.
THAT'S PART OF THE TREND THAT SURPRISES PEOPLE. LOOK AT THE CHANGE IN HAZLETON.
MORE THAN 60% HISPANIC. IN THAT TIME, IT USED TO BE BLUE. TRUMP COMES ALONG AND IT'S RED
AND TRUMP TO BY DOUBLE DIGITS IN 2020. READING WHERE GEORGE JUST WAS, A SIMILAR TREND. VERY DEMOCRATIC BUT IT WAS 20
POINTS MORE DEMOCRATIC IN 2012 THAN 2020 WHEN TRUMP RAN A SECOND TIME.
YOU SEE THAT TIGHT RANGE OF FOODS BETWEEN 80,000 AND BIDEN'S FAVOR AND 44 IN TRUMP'S
FAVOR. REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN HOPING THE TREND IN THESE COUNTIES WE ARE SHOWING AND THE CITIES
CONTINUES, AND THAT'S WHERE THEY COULD FIND THE DIFFERENCE. >> WE'RE FOCUSED ON PENNSYLVANIA BUT BOTTOM LINE, IS A TREND WE ARE SEEING IN ALL
THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY? >> ABSOLUTELY. LET'S CALL A THE MAP. THE CORE BATTLEGROUND STATES,
PENNSYLVANIA ONE OF THEM. LARGE HISPANIC POPULATION IN NEVADA.
TRUMP HAS BEEN PULLING BILL THERE. ARIZONA, SIGNIFICANT IN GEORGIA AS WELL. AS GEORGE SAID, ONE INTERESTING NOTE, THE STORY IS TRUMP OVER
PERFORMING RELATIVE TO THE PAST AMONG HISPANICS. THE EARLY POLLS WITH HARRIS INSTEAD OF BIDEN TO SUGGEST SHE
MIGHT BE IMPROVING THE DEMOCRATIC NUMBER WITH HISPANICS SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP AN
EYE ON. >> I WAS GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. >>> THE CLIMATE CRISIS THIS
RATTLING INDIA THIS MORNING. TEMPERATURES ARE SOARING NORTH OF 110 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.
>>> WE ARE BACK WITH A CLOSE LOOK AT THE CLIMATE CRISIS UNFOLDING IN INDIA. WATER IS RUNNING SCARCE AS TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO SOAR

WARNING'S, FOREST FIRES, WILTING CROPS.
ACROSS ASIA, EUROPE AND THE U.S. ACCORDING TO NEW DATA COMPILED BY NASA, JULY 22 WAS
THE HOTTEST DAY ON RECORD FOR THE PLANET EVER. PART OF WHAT SCIENTISTS CALL A
LONG-TERM WARMING TREND DRIVEN BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY THE EMISSION OF GREENHOUSE GASES.
FEW PLACES ON EARTH SHOW THE CRITICAL CHALLENGE OF EXTREME AND RISING HEAT LIKE INDIA. WHERE RECORD HEAT WAVES THIS
SUMMER HAD TEMPERATURES HOVERING AT 115 DEGREES OR HIGHER. INTENSE HOT STRETCHES THAT
EXPERTS SAY ARE LONGER AND MORE DANGEROUS. >> PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE IN INDIA THINK INDIA IS ALWAYS
HOT. >> ADVISORIES HAVE COME -- THIS YEAR HAS BEEN
>> Reporter: THE CONCERN IS WHEN HUMIDITY IS ADDED TO TEMPERATURE KNOWN AS A WET BULB MEASUREMENT.
WHEN THE LEVEL APPROACH IS A BODY'S TEMPERATURE, IT'S HARDER FOR HUMANS TO SWEAT AND SURVIVE. IN A REPORT LAST NOVEMBER, THE WORLD BANK BOARD THAT THE
TEMPERATURES IN INDIA COULD MAKE IT ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES TO TEST THAT THRESHOLD.
ALREADY IN TEEMING CITIES LIKE NEW DELHI, DRINKING WATER FOR MILLIONS IS SO SCARCE THAT THE
GOVERNMENT MOVED TO RATION IT. THE WATER TRUCKS COME TWO OR
THREE TIMES A DAY BUT IT RUNS OUT FAST, AND THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH. SALES OF AIR-CONDITIONERS HAVE SURGE BUT ONLY FOR THOSE WHO
CAN AFFORD A. THE INTERNATIONAL
ENERGY AGENCY PREDICTS BY 2050, INDIA WILL HAVE 1 BILLION AC GOING KICKING OFF EVEN MORE HEAT.
WITH TEMPERATURES ON THE RISE, THIS GROUP OF FRIENDS IS HITTING THE STREETS.
THEY GIVE OUT HATS AND UMBRELLAS TO STREET VENDORS AND LABORERS WHO HAVE NO WAY TO HIDE FROM EXTREME HEAT. >> WE START THE CHANGE AND
BRING THE CHANGE IN OUR DAILY LIFE. THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE NORM.
REALIZING IT'S NOT OKAY. >> Reporter: INDIA'S GOVERNMENT HAD A HEAT ACTION PLAN THAT
PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO ADAPT TO A NEW ERA OF TEMPERATURES THAT JUST KEEP RISING.

SHARES A STARBUCKS ARE MOVING HIGHER DESPITE REPORTING A BIGGER THAN EXPECTED DROP IN SALES THIS PAST QUARTER.
MOST OF THE WEAKNESSES IN CHINA WHERE STARBUCKS FACES INTENSE COMPETITION AND A SLOW ECONOMIC RECOVERY, BUT, U.S. SALES ALSO
SLIPPED AND STARBUCKS SAYS EFFORTS TO WIN BACK CUSTOMERS TIRED OF HIGHER PRICES ARE STARTING TO BE A. DOES INCLUDE
NEW PROMOTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO SPEED UP ORDERS. THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION SAID AMAZON IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR HAZARDOUS PRODUCTS SOLD BY THIRD PARTIES ON ITS PLATFORM AND SHIPPED BY THE COMPANY. THAT MEANS AMAZON IS LEGALLY ON
THE HOOK FOR THE RECALLS OF MORE THAN 400,000 PRODUCTS INCLUDING DEFECTIVE HAIRDRYERS
AND CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS. AMAZON PLANS TO APPEAL THE DECISION IN COURT.
