>> WE ARE LEVELING UP IN
LOOKING AT THE WITH BIG SPORT
THAT SENDING ATHLETES TO BRAND NEW HEIGHTS. YES, WE ARE
BREAKING DOWN HOW TO SCORE CLIMBING AND CLIMBING AT THE
OLYMPICS ACTUALLY HAS 3 DIFFERENT FORMATS. THEIR SPEED
CLIMBING. THERE'S BOULDERING AND THEN THERE'S LEAD CLIMBING.
WE'RE GOING TO START BY LOOKING AT SPEED CLIMBING NOW IN SPEED
CLIMBING. THE WALL IS ABOUT 50 FEET HIGH. AND THE KEY HERE IS
THAT EVERY ATHLETE, EVERY CLIMBER AT THESE GAMES ALREADY
KNOWS THIS WALL INSIDE NOW BECAUSE IT'S THE EXACT SAME LAY
OUT ALL OVER THE WORLD. SO THAT'S WHY IT'S ALL ABOUT
SPEED. THEY KNOW THE ROUTE WHO CAN DO IT. THE FASTEST
CLIMBERS ARE STILL FINDING WAYS TO SHAVE MILLISECONDS OFF THEIR
TIME BY OPTIMIZING EACH MOVE THEY MAKE UP THE WALL.
SPEED CLIMBERS IN PARIS ARE GOING TO START OUT BY RACING
AGAINST THE CLOCK. THE BEST TIMES GETTING TO THE TOP OF
THAT WAR ARE GOING TO HELP DETERMINE SEEDING FOR A SINGLE
ELIMINATION HEAD-TO-HEAD TOURNAMENT. AT THE END OF THAT
TOURNAMENT, WHOEVER WINS
WAS WALKING AWAY WITH A GOLD MEDAL BECAUSE SPEED CLIMBING IS
ITS OWN SEPARATE OLYMPIC EVENT. THE OTHER 2 TYPES BOULDERING
AND LEAD CLIMBING ARE COMBINED TO BECOME EVENT OF THEIR OWN.
SO LET'S GET TO THAT COMBINED EVENT IN THE KEY HERE IS THAT
UNLIKE IN SPEED CLIMBING THE LAYOUT OF THE WALL IN
BOULDERING AND LEAD CLIMBING IS A MYSTERY TO THE CLIMBERS.
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS UNTIL THEY'RE STANDING IN FRONT
OF IT NOW IN BOULDERING. THE GOAL IS STILL TO REACH THE
TOP AS FAST AS YOU CAN. BUT THE BIGGER CHALLENGE IS FIGURING
OUT HOW EXACTLY TO CLIMB UP. EACH SET OF UNIQUELY PLACED CAN
HOLD
WHEN THE FIRST ROUND CLIMBERS GET 5 MINUTES TO FINISH IN THE
SECOND ROUND, WHICH IS ALSO THE FINAL ROUND THAT GOES DOWN TO 4
MINUTES. ALTHOUGH THEY DO GET A FEW EXTRA MINUTES TO STUDY THE
WALL FIRST NOW THE BOULDERING WALL IS A LOT SHORTER. THEN THE
SPEED WALL IN THE LEAD WAS ONLY ABOUT 15 FEET HIGH. THAT MEANS
THE CLIMBERS ARE NOT WEARING OR USING ROPES. AND THIS IS JUST A
HEAVILY PADDED FLOOR. THERE'S ACTUALLY 4 DIFFERENT PATHS FOR
DIFFERENT COURSES HERE. THAT COLD PROBLEMS IN. BASICALLY THE
IDEA FOR THE CLIMBERS IS THEY'VE GOT TO GET TO THE TOP
OF EACH ONE OF THESE PROBLEMS AND GET TO THE HAND, HOLD ITS
THERE IN MAINTAIN POSITION. IF THEY CAN DO THAT ON ONE TRY,
IT'S WORTH 25 POINT. SO YOU'VE GOT 4 PROBLEMS HERE. TOTAL
POSSIBILITY OF 25 POINTS FOR EACH 100 POINTS. THE MAXIMUM
SCORE.
NOW, IF A CLIMBER DOESN'T FINISH A PROBLEM, THEY STILL
CAN EARN POINTS BY REACHING CHECKPOINTS ALONG THE WAY.
THEY CAN ALSO TRY A PROBLEM WILL TO PULL TIMES. BUT THERE'S
ALSO A TINY POINT DEDUCTION. EACH TIME THEY HAVE A FAILED
ATTEMPT.
UNLIKE IN BOULDERING EACH ATHLETE AND LEAD CLIMBING ONLY
GETS ONE ATTEMPT, THE CLIMB AS HIGH AS THEY CAN. THEY GET 6
MINUTES TO DO IT. THIS TESTS ENDURANCE IN SKILL. THEY ALSO
GET 6 MINUTES TO OBSERVE THE WANT TO STUDY IT BEFORE THEY
START.
THIS IS A LEAD CLIMBER IN ACTION. STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO
GO. TAKE A LOOK, THOUGH, WHAT HE'S GRASPING RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S COLD. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE GOT TO HOLD PRETTY
SELF-EXPLANATORY. NOW THE HIGHER HE MANAGES TO CLIMB ON
THIS WALL, THE MORE POINTS HE'S GOING TO GET IN. IF YOU CAN GET
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP
AND ESTABLISH POSITION MEMBER, THAT'S THE KEY. YOU CAN GET 100
POINTS. AND AFTER THAT, EACH CLIMBER SCORES ARE ADDED
TOGETHER, GETS THEIR OVERALL SCORE. IN THE TOP 8 ATHLETE
ADVANCED TO THE FINALS IN THE FINALS. THE ROUTES ARE ALL
GOING TO CHANGE, BUT OTHERWISE THE COMPETITION REMAINS THE
SAME.
AND AFTER THE FINAL ROUND, THE ATHLETES WITH THE HIGHEST
COMBINED SCORES, THEY GET THE MEDALS AND SPEAKING OF MEDALS.
I HOPE ALL OF US NOW HAVE A METAL WHEN IT COMES TO
UNDERSTANDING OLYMPIC CLIMBING. AND I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN US FOR
MORE BREAKDOWNS OF OLYMPICS COURT
