LIKE FOR YOU TO COME BACK?

OPENING CEREMONIES, YOU KNOW,
JUST BEING A PART OF OPENING
CEREMONIES FOR ME, I HAD HAIR
STICKING STRAIGHT OCCUPYUP ON MY
I HAD THE EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS
OF BEING BACK AT AN OLYMPIC
GAMES.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF YOUR
FORMER TEAMMATES COMPETING.
WHO ARE YOU WATCHING?
>> OBVIOUSLY KATIE LEDECKY IS --
SHE'S LIKE MY LITTLE SISTER.
I'VE KNOWN HER FOREVER.
AND YOU KNOW, GO BACK TO THAT
OLD PHOTO OF HER AND I WHEN SHE
WAS A LITTLE 10-YEAR-OLD OR
HOWEVER OLD SHE WAS.
YOU KNOW, SHE IS REALLY -- SHE'S
MADE A NAME FOR HERSELF AND
BECOME A DOMINANT NAME IN THE
SPORT.
>> LAST TIME WE TALKED WE WERE
TAKING ABOUT MEDALS, THE MENTAL
APPROACH.
AS YOU WATCH THESE ATHLETES NOW,
HOW ARE THEY -- HOW DO THEY SEEM
TO YOU?
>> FOR ME A LOT OF THEM HAVE
TAKEN THAT PART OF IT IN CONTROL
FOR THEMSELVES.
I THINK WE'VE HAD A LOT OF
ADDITIONS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH
SPACE FROM THE U.S. OC.
JUST FROM TAKINGLKING TO THE
SWIMMERS IT'S COOL AND POWERFUL
THEY'RE TAKING THAT ON
THEMSELVES AND TAKING CARE OF
THE MENTAL AND THE PHYSICAL.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS IS THE
RIVALRY BETWEEN USA AND
AUSTRALIA.
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?
>> WHEN WE ARE IN THE POOL, YES,
OF COURSE.
WE'RE COMPETITORS, RIGHT?
WE WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO
BEAT THE PERSON NEXT TO US,
WHOEVER IT MIGHT BE.
BUT WHEN WE'RE OUT OF THE POOL,
WE'RE FRIENDS.
SAYING THAT, I HOPE TEAM USA
RINGS THOSE COW BELLS AS LOUD AS
THEY CAN POSSIBLY RING THEM ALL
MEET LONG.
>> WHO SHOULD WE BE WATCHING FOR
THE FUTURE?
>> I THINK KATE DOUGLAS HAS A
GREAT CHANCE IN THE TWO BREAST.
JACK ALEXEI, HUNTER ARMSTRONG,
HUNTER BECK, IT'S ANYONE'S BALL
GAME.
I THINK THAT'S THE GREATEST
THING ABOUT THIS SPORT I THINK
NOW IS YOU REALLY SEE THE
YOUNGER GENERATION THAT'S
STEPPING UP AND DOESN'T -- IT
DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY'RE RACING
KATIE LEDECKY OR CALEB DRESSEL.
THEY THINK THEY CAN BEAT THEM.

THE WORK.
THERAPY EVERY THURSDAY HAS
BECOME AS CRITICAL AS HER REPS
IN THE GYMS.
>> BEFORE I WAS KIND OF LIKE
PUSHING DOWN MY TRAUMA, AND NOW
I'VE LEARNED TO SPEAK ON IT AND
KIND OF RELEASE THAT SO THAT'S
REALLY HELPED ME.
THAT'S WHY I'M DOING WHAT I'M
DOING TODAY.
>> DO YOU FEEL STRONGER NOW THAN
YOU HAVE BEFORE?
>> I THINK SO.
I THINK WE USED TO THINK OF
THERAPY AS A WEAKNESS.
NOW I THINK OF IT AS A STRENGTH.
IF THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT CAN
HELP ME DEAL WITH WHAT I'M GOING
THROUGH, THEN THAT'S WHAT I NEED
TO DO.
>> IT IS THE WOMEN'S TEAM FINAL
FROM TOKYO.

OLYMPICS ANY OF THEM HAD DREAMED
OF.
>> I'M GOING HOME IN ONE PIECE
WHICH I WAS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS
ABOUT.
SO I'M NOT MAD.
>> BACK AT HOME, SIMONE FOCUSED
ON HER MENTAL HEALTH.
SHE ALSO GOT MARRIED, BECAME AN
AUNT, AND THEN SLOWLY STARTED TO
THINK ABOUT A COMEBACK.
HOW LONG DID YOU HAVE TO MULL IT
OVER?
>> IT TOOK A WHILE BECAUSE I WAS
WATCHING GYMNASTICS ON TV, BUT
THEN, YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME
SOMEBODY TWISTED I WAS LIKE, MY
GOSH.
ONE DAY I WOKE UP LIKE, OKAY,
LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

RIGHT BACK.
>> SIMONE BILES!

>> VAULTING SIMONE TO HER THIRD
OLYMPICS AND A CHANCE AT WHAT
SHE SAYS IS REDEMPTION.
HOW DO YOU WANT TO BE

>> AS LONG AS I WAS HAVING FUN
AND DOING WHAT I LOVE, THAT'S
ALL THAT YOU CAN DO BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT TO LOOK BACK 50 YEARS
NOW FROM NOW SAYING SHE WAS
GOOD, BUT SHE WAS SO MISERABLE.
A COUPLE TIMES I MIGHT HAVE FELT
THAT.
NOW I'M LIKE, LOOK AT HER GO.
SHE'S LOVING WHAT SHE'S DOING
WITH WHO SHE'S DOING IT
WITH.
SO REALLY JUST EMBRACING THAT
MOMENT.

RISE," AND SO SHE DOES.
