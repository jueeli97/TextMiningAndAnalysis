GOLD RIGHT NOW ON "MORNING NEWS
NOW," WITH LESS THAN 100 DAYS UNTIL THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BOTH CAMPAIGNS ARE WRAPPING UP THE RHETORIC. >> HE IS A RADICAL LEFT LUNATIC.
>> SOME OF WHAT HE AND HIS RUNNING MATE THURSDAY, IT'S PLAIN WEIRD.
>> WE GOT THE LATEST FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT THAT COULD BE JUST DAYS AWAY
>>> TENSIONS IN THE MIDDLE EATS ARE RATCHETING UP ISRAEL BLAMING HAS BEEN VOWING AND RETALIATION FOLLOWING A DEADLY
ROCKET ATTACK LAUNCHED FROM LEBANON.
>>> CALIFORNIA ON FIRE.
FAMILIES FORCED TO EVACUATE AS CREWS BATTLED LARGEST WILDFIRE THAT WAS CONSISTENT IN YEARS. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES HAVE ALREADY BEEN SCORCHED AND
WITH THE FLAME SHOWING NO SIGNS OF SLOWING, SMOKE IS NOT REACHING ALL THE WAY TO THE
EAST COAST. WE GOT THE LATEST. >>> THE OLYMPICS ARE OFFICIALLY UNDER WAY.
WHERE DO THINGS STAND AFTER THE FIRST WEEKEND OF ACTION? WE WILL BREAK DOWN ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS YOU MAY HAVE MISSED AND WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW AND
BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR AS A WEEK GOES ON. >>> GOOD MORNING.
WE BEGIN THIS MORNING WITH A TIGHT RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE WHICH IS NOW LESS THAN 100 DAYS
AWAY. RECENT POLLS SHOW FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS APPROACHING A DEAD HEAT IN
MULTIPLE BATTLEGROUND STATES. THOSE POLLS LEAVING TRUMP'S SHARPENING HIS ATTACKS.
FIRST, AT THE COIN CONFERENCE IN NASHVILLE, HE DISMISSED THE
SURGE IN THE PULSE OF THE HONEYMOON PHASE. >> WE HAVE COUNTRY TO RUN. THE PROBLEM IS, LAW IS WORSE
THAN JOE. SHE IS A RADICAL LEFT LUNATIC.
>> TRUMP AND HIS RUNNING MATE JD VANCE HAD A RALLY IN
MINNESOTA WHERE HARRIS HAS THE BIGGEST LEAD THAT NOMINEE SPENT A LARGE PART OF HIS ATTACKS AT PRESIDENT BIDEN.
MEANWHILE, HARRIS'S CAMPAIGN EARNED MORE THAN $1 MILLION
ADDING TO HER MASSIVE $200 MILLION FUND-RAISING TOTAL JUST ONE WEEK INTO THE RACE.
WE HAVE A TEAM JOINING US THIS MORNING TO BREAK DOWN THE LATEST INCLUDING NBC NEWS POLITICAL REPORTER JOHN ALLEN
AND SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT GABE GUTIERREZ. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
JOHN, I WANT TO START WITH YOU. MINNESOTA IS THE ONE STATE WHERE VP HARRIS IS MEETING
TRUMP. SO, WHY IS HE FOCUSING HIS TIME AND ENERGY THERE?
WE ARE STILL SEEING ATTACKS AT BIDEN. >> THE REASON IS THERE HAVE
BEEN POLLING OVER THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND CERTAINLY, IN
THE LAST WEEKS OF THE BUYING CAMPAIGN BEFORE WE GOT A HARRIS CAMPAIGN, THE NUMBERS ACCORDING
TO INDEPENDENT POLLSTERS CLOSE SIGNIFICANTLY.
THERE WAS A PLAN TO GO TO MINNESOTA, I STATE THAT IS GOING TO BE A BATTLEGROUND AND
FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT PLAN. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH
POLLING. WE ARE STILL EARLY IN THE STATE OF A NEW CAMPAIGN OF HARRIS
VERSUS TRUMP AS OPPOSED TO BIDEN VERSUS TRUMP.
>> WHAT A DIFFERENCE A WEEK MAKES. THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN SEEMS TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL TURNOUT THIS WEEKEND.
THEY ARE TRYING TO WIND GEN Z SUPPORT. WALK US THROUGH WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY ABOUT HER MESSAGES TO THAT GROUP OF YOUNGER VOTERS?
>> IT IS NO SECRET THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD A DIFFICULT TIME WITH YOUNG VOTERS AND VP
HARRIS IS TRYING TO LEAD INTO THAT. THE PAST COUPLE DAYS, SHE HAS TAKEN MORE DIRECT ATTACKS ON
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS RUNNING MATE JD VANCE REFERRING TO THEM AS WEIRD AND
ALSO ATTACKING THE COMMENTS FROM 2021 WERE JD VANCE REFER TO SOME DEMOCRATS AS, QUOTE
CHILDLESS CAT LADIES. BUT THE VICE PRESIDENT AND HER TEAM ARE LEANING INTO SOCIAL
MEDIA TRYING TO WIN OVER THE GEN Z VOTERS. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF MEANS AND THEY ARE LEANING INTO THAT
HOPING IT MIGHT CONVINCE SOME OF THESE YOUNGER VOTERS TO GO TO THE POLLS AND, AS OF NOW, HER MAIN MESSAGE HAS BEEN THAT
YOUNG VOTERS DELIVER THE 2020 ELECTION TO JOE BIDEN AND SHE IS TRYING TO GET THAT SAME TYPE
OF BEEN LOUISIANA THEM THIS NOVEMBER. >> THEY TOLD ME THIS IS JUST
THE BEGINNING. THE POLLS MERELY TRUMPED UP HER POLICIES ARE LARGELY THE SAME AS
BIDEN'S. WHAT IS PLAYING VOTERS' OPINIONS.
>> RIGHT OFF THE BAT, YOU HAVE A CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN WHO WAS STRUGGLING SO MUCH THAT HE
CHOSE NOT TO SEEK RE-ELECTION. HERE'S A GUY THAT WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HIS ENTIRE ADULT
LIFE AND WHO EVENTUALLY REALIZED THERE WAS NOT A PATH
TO VICTORY. THE REASON WHY DEMOCRATIC VOTERS WERE NOT EXCITED ABOUT HIM COMING INDEPENDENT VOTERS
WERE WORRIED ABOUT IT AND THEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD NOT BE IN OFFICE NOW BASED ON HIS
APPARENT DECLINE. SO, REPLACE THEM WITH SOLID -- SOMEBODY WITH ENTHUSIASM AND
AND NOT STUMBLING IN PUBLIC APPEARANCES, I THINK THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS A BIG REASON
FOR WHY YOU SEE A CHANGE SO QUICKLY. THE OTHER THING IS, KAMALA
HARRIS IS SOMEBODY THAT DEMOCRATS ARE EXCITED ABOUT. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN PUNCH
THE TICKET OR PULL THE LEVER IN THE BALLOT BOX FOR HER. AGAIN, WE ARE STILL EARLY AND
HAVE NOT EVEN HIT LABOR DAY YET. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS A 180 ON THE ENERGY BEHIND ITS CANOPY
>> AT BACK TO PRESIDENT BIDEN. HE IS HEADED TO TEXAS TODAY.
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT? >> THIS IS A TRIP THAT WHISKEY RESCHEDULED FOLLOWING -- RESCHEDULED FOLLOWING THE
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON DONALD TRUMP.
-- IN TEXAS BUT THIS MORNING, HE HAS PUBLISHED AN OP-ED IN
THE WASHINGTON POST AND WE EXPECT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHERE HE IS
PROPOSING SEVERAL SUPREME COURT REFORMS. A MESSAGE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN TOUTING OVER THE LAST
SEVERAL WEEKS. AMONG THOSE REFORMS INCLUDES TERM LIMITS, AND ALSO A BINDING
CODE OF ETHICS FOR THE SUPREME COURT. THIS COMES AFTER THE SUPREME COURT RENDERED THAT DECISION ON
PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND THE PRESIDENT HAS REALLY FOCUSED IN ON THIS
MESSAGE FOR EMILY, IT IS UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT THAT THERE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE BUT THIS IS A WINNING
MESSAGE COME NOVEMBER. >> BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, JOHN, VP HARRIS HAS YET TO ANNOUNCE A
RUNNING ME. DO YOU BELIEVE SHE IS CLOSER TO A DECISION? WHEN DO YOU THINK IT WILL, AND WHO DO YOU THINK THE FAVORITES
ARE AT THIS POINT? >> THERE IS WORK THAT SIMONE BILES IS TOO YOUNG TO BE VICE
PRESIDENT. AND MOST OF THE OLYMPIC ATHLETE ARE. WE HAVE SEEN A WHOLE GROUP OF GOVERNORS AND ONE SENATOR, MARK
KELLY FROM ARIZONA, AND GOVERNOR COOPER FROM NORTH
CAROLINA AND SHAPIRO FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND BASHIR FROM KENTUCKY. I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL,
AND MY SOURCES HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHO THEY THINK IT WILL BE, OR AT LEAST WHO THEY KNOW IT WILL
BE, BUT WE WILL FIND OUT WITH THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. >> DOESN'T WANT SIMONE BILES?
RIGHT? THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME. >>> LEADERS ARE URGING
RESTRAINT AS ISRAEL DECIDES HOW IT WILL RESPOND TO A ROCKET STRIKE THAT KILLED 12 YOUNG PEOPLE THANK GOLAN HEIGHTS.
ISRAEL HAS BOUGHT FOR THE ATTACK AND IS VOWING TO RESPOND BUT THE GROUP HAD DENY RESPONSIBILITY. THE VICTIMS WERE FROM A
COMMUNITY THAT PRACTICES AN OFFSHOOT OF ISLAM AND MORE THAN
20,000 ALSO LIVED AND THE OCCUPIED GOLAN HEIGHTS. OUR CORRESPONDENT JOINS US NOW.
LAST NIGHT, ISRAEL SAID IT WOULD DECIDE ON THE, QUOTE, MANNER AND TIMING OF THE RESPONSE, BUT WE HAVE ALREADY
SEEN SOME ATTACKS ON LEBANON. WHAT THE LATEST? >> THERE WAS A DRONE STRIKE OUTSIDE OF TOWN THIS MORNING
AND TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND THREE INJURED. SATURDAY'S ROCKET ATTACK ON THE
SOCCER FIELD SET UP A SERIES OF RETALIATORY STRIKES AND THE DEFENSE FORCES SAID THEY HIT
SEVEN TARGETS DEEP INSIDE LEBANESE TERRITORY. HEZBOLLAH SAYS IT HIT HIS REALITY -- IN RESPONSE TO THE
NME'S AGGRESSION. ALL OF THIS AFTER THAT STRIKE ON THE SOCCER FIELD SATURDAY
EVENING. THERE IS A BOMB SHELTER A FEW YARDS FROM THE SOCCER FIELD AND
RESIDENTS SAID THERE WAS NO TIME TO REACH IT BECAUSE THE SIREN SOUNDED JUST MOMENTS BEFORE THE BLAST.
ISRAEL SAYS AT LEAST A DOZEN CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS WERE KILLED IN THE BLAST AND BLINKED HAD BEFORE.
CLAIMING ROCKET FRAGMENTS ON SITE ARE FROM A TYPE ONLY USED BY HEZBOLLAH.
HABILIS SAYS IT WAS FIRING ROCKETS AT ISRAEL SATURDAY BUT DENIED INVOLVEMENT IN THAT STRIKE.
>> TALK TO US ABOUT THE DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS WE HAVE BEEN
FROM THE U.S. TO TRY AND STOP THE CONFLICT FROM BROADENING TO LEBANON. >> MANY WORLD LEADERS URGING,
RIGHT NOW. SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN AMONG THEM.
HE SAID THERE WAS EVERY INDICATION THAT THE ROCKETS THAT HIT THE SOCCER FIELD OR FROM HEZBOLLAH AND HE SAID HE WAS DEEPLY SADDENED BY THE LOSS
OF LIFE BUT URGING RESTRAINT. TAKE A LISTEN. >> WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH
THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL. AND, GAIN, I EMPHASIZED IT IS RIGHT TO DEFEND ITS CITIZENS
AND OUR DETERMINATION TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THAT, BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO SEE
THE CONFLICT ESCALATE OR SPREAD. >> THAT IS A REAL RISK. IT IS A RISK ALL ALONG, EVER
SINCE THE ATTACKS ON OCTOBER 7th. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, HE IS VOWING TO STRIKE BACK USING
VERY FIRM LANGUAGE AND SAID HEZBOLLAH WOULD PAY A HEAVY PRICE, HEAVIER THAN BEFORE.
HE MET WITH HIS POLITICAL SECURITY CABINET ON SUNDAY
RUSHING BACK FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., AND LEAVING A FEW HOURS EARLY, IN FACT, TO MEET WITH
TOP SECURITY OFFICIALS. THE RISK OF ESCALATION IS A REAL WORRY FOR PEOPLE AROUND
THE WORLD. FOR LEADERS IN THE U.S. AS WELL. IT IS RISING TODAY AND THE IDF
IS WARNING OVER THE WEEKEND THAT THEY ARE ON THE BRINK OF AN ALL-OUT WAR AGAINST HEZBOLLAH. THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT
LEADERS IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT AND THE KIND OF THING, ONCE AGAIN, THEY ARE TRYING
DESPERATELY TO PREVENT THIS MORNING. >> KELLY, THERE WAS ALSO A
DEADLY WEEKEND IN GAZA. THEY CAPTURED THE AFTERMATH OF THE ISRAELI AIR STRIKE ON A
SCHOOL. WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT THAT? >> YES, THE WAR OBVIOUSLY CONTINUES AND AND AIR STRIKE
HIT A SCHOOL IN CENTRAL GAZA BEING USED AS A SHELTER BY DISPLACED PEOPLE.
THE AFTERMATH CAUGHT ON CAMERA BY OUR NEWS TEAM. VERY SAD IMAGES OF PARENTS LOOKING FOR THEIR CHILDREN,
DISTRAUGHT CHILDREN, A LOT OF DEBRIS AND A LOT OF DISTURBING IMAGES.
AT LEAST 30 PEOPLE WERE KILLED ACCORDING TO GAZA HEALTH OFFICIALS ISRAEL FOR ITS PART
SAID THEY WERE TARGETING HAMAS COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTER USED TO STORE WEAPONS AND PLAN ATTACKS.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL THE DETAILS FOR >>> THIS MORNING, FIREFIGHTERS
IN CALIFORNIA ARE TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON ONE OF THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN THE STATE'S
HISTORY. IT IS CHARRED MORE THAN 360,000 ACRES TO AND DESTROYED DOZENS OF STRUCTURES AND IS SO BIG YOU
CAN SEE IT FROM SPACE. OUR CORRESPONDENT D PATTERSON
IS IN CHICO, CALIFORNIA, WITH THE LATEST. >> Reporter: THIS STARTED AS A SMALL BRUSH FIRE A FEW DAYS
AGO. WE WATCHED A ROPE FROM 50,000 ACRES TO 160,000 ACRES AND NOW
THERE IS MORE THAN 360,000 ACRES, AND IS THE SEVENTH LARGEST FIRE AND CALIFORNIA AND
THE LARGEST ACTIVE FIRE BURNING NOW.
IT HAS DISPLACED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT HAD TO BE EVACUATED YEARS AGO FOR THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE
WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY OF, THE CAMP FIRE.
THE FIRE IS ALSO BEING INVESTIGATED AS A ARSON. ALL OF
THIS WHILE THE FIRE CONTINUES ITS RAPID EXPANSION AND GROWING SO BIG SO FAST ON ALL FRONTS
THAT THE PRIMARY OPERATION RIGHT NOW IS JUST SLOWING IT DOWN. THANKFULLY, THE WEATHER IS
COOPERATING. IT IS A LOT COLDER THAN IT HAD BEEN AND FIREFIGHTERS CAN GET
SOME CONTAINMENT ON IT. WE ARE UP TO 12%, BUT THE FEAR IS THAT THE LARGEST FIRE
CURRENTLY BURNING WILL ONLY GET LARGER. THERE IS FRESH BONE DRY FUEL
AND THE RIGHT IS THIS COULD LAST FOR MONTHS. BACK TO YOU. >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>> AND PARIS, WE ARE ENTERING
DAY THREE OF OLYMPIC EVENT AFTER A THRILLING OPENING WEEKEND.
THE SUMMER GAMES HAVE DELIVERED ON ALL OF THE EXCITEMENT THROUGH THE FIRST DAYS OF
COMPETITION. WE HAVE WITNESSED JAW-DROPPING
MOMENTS AND DRAMA AND PHOTO FINISHES AND PLENTY OF SMILES. IT HAS BEEN A BRIGHT START FOR TEAM USA WHO LEAD THE MEDAL
COUNT AMONG ALL NATIONS AND WITH SUPERSTARS LIKE SIMONE BILES AND COCO GAUFF, THERE IS
A LOT TO LOOK FORWARD TO AS WE GET READY FOR ANOTHER FULL DAY OF EVENTS. OUR CORRESPONDENT DURING THE
FLIGHT BACK FROM PARIS WITH ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS. WHAT AN INCREDIBLE DAY.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE OLYMPICS. TEAM USA WASTED NO TIME PICKING UP THEIR FIRST MEDALS.
WALK US THROUGH THE EXCITEMENT SO FAR WHAT THE TOP MOMENTS HAVE BEEN. >> Reporter: IT HAS BEEN A
AMAZING. THE START THAT THEY'VE GOTTEN OFF. EVERYONE WATCHING AND EVERYONE
HERE WHO HAD THE CHANCE TO MAKE THE TRIP, THE AMERICANS ARE SO
EXCITED AND ARE WINNING IN THE WATER, AS WE EXPECTED. THEY WON IN MOUNTAIN BIKING AND
MAYBE YOU CAN TELL, THEY ARE ALSO WINNING IN A PLACE WE
DON'T ALWAYS EXPECT. THEY ARE WINNING AND FENCING. TEAM USA FENCING TAKING A STAB
AT VICTORY LAST NIGHT AND BOY WAS IT A STRONG WIN. LEE KIEFER BEE LAUREN SCRUGGS
AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THING TO SEE. IT IS THE FIRST TIME EVER AN AMERICAN WOMAN HAS GONE BACK TO
BACK GOLD AND THE FIRST TIME WE HAD ALL-AMERICAN FINAL IN THAT EVENT. THAT HAS BEEN GREAT TO SEE. ONE OF THOSE EVENTS YOU DON'T
THINK ALOUD ABOUT -- THINK A LOT ABOUT AND ONE THEY ARE
REALLY PROUD OF, THEY FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD BE THE STRONGEST WHEN IT COMES TO FOIL FENCING AND THEY ARE IMPRESSED WITH THEIR WIN BY TEAM USA.
THAT HAS BEEN NEED TO SEE AS WELL. BY FAR, THE POOL HAS BEEN THE PLACE FOR THE AMERICANS I FOUND
THE MOST AS FAR AS GOLD, SILVER AND BRONZE IS CONCERNED.
WE HAVE FIVE MORE CHANCES TONIGHT, BY THE WAY. >> YOUR COMMITMENT IS ON MATCHED AND INCREDIBLE.
I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS UNIFORM YOUR WINTER WE ALSO SAW TEAM
USA'S BIGGEST STAR DELIVER IN THE EARLY EVENTS INCLUDING THE RETURN OF SIMONE BILES TO THE WORLD'S BIGGEST STAGE. WHAT WERE THE HIGHLIGHTS AND
WHAT IS NEXT? >> OH, MY GOODNESS. THAT WAS AMAZING TO SEE YESTERDAY.
THEY WERE ON TOP AS FAR AS QUALIFYING IN TEAM COMPETITION AND THEN SIMONE BILES
YESTERDAY, I MEAN, SHE BEE
EVERYONE IN POINTS MOVING TO THE MIDDLE ROW TOMORROW. SHE YESTERDAY WENT THROUGH THE
ROUTINE THAT IN TOKYO SHE REALIZED SHE HAD THE TWISTIES AND NAILED IT.
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO SEE AND HER SMILE BEAMING AFTERWARDS.
UNBELIEVABLE. YOU CAN TELL THIS IS SOMETHING SHE WAS THINKING ABOUT AND WAS IN THE BACK OF HER MIND AND SHE
PUSHED THROUGH AND IT WAS SO COOL TO SEE. >> THERE ARE SEVERAL MORE SWIMMING MEDAL UP FOR GRABS
LATER TODAY. THAT IS ONE OF THE HIGHLY WATCHED EVENTS. WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING AND
LOOKING OUT FOR ON DAY THREE? >> Reporter: LET ME GET TO
THAT. I HAVE TO PUT ON MY READING GLASSES TO MAKE SURE I GET EVERYTHING RIGHT. WOMEN'S 400 IM.
YOU'VE GOT THE MEN'S 200 FREE AND MID-100s BACK AND RYAN MAR
, TEAM CAPTAIN, IS A -- HE IS GOING TO BE STRONG THERE.
THE WOMEN'S RESTROOM, -- BREASTSTROKE.
THAT SHOULD BE A LOT OF FUN AND SOMETHING TEAM USA STRONG AT. THEN YOU HAVE THE WOMEN'S 200
FREE. A LOT OF CHANCES IN THE POOL.
THAT WILL BE A PLACE WHERE WE CONTINUE TO WATCH AND SEE THE AMERICANS GOING ON GREAT
STRIDES. THE WEATHER IN PARIS HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL UNLESS YOU ARE WEARING A SUIT FROM USA FENCING.
>> I THINK WHAT YOU ARE TELLING ME IS I WILL SEE YOU IN L.A. 2028, RIGHT?
>> I'M AN ALTERNATE RIGHT NOW SO YOU NEVER KNOW.
>> FINGERS CROSSED. THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>> THERE IS A NEW ENERGY AT
THIS YEAR'S OLYMPICS NOW THAT THE COVID RESTRICTIONS ARE A THING OF THE PAST. FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE MAKING A ROARING RETURN TO THE GAMES.
WE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ONE OLYMPIC FAMILY. >> Reporter: THIS OLYMPICS
LOOKS AND SOUNDS DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST ONE WENT ATHLETES COMPETED IN QUIET
VENUES IN TOKYO BECAUSE OF COVID. COACHES STEPPED IN AS CHEERLEADERS WHILE FRIENDS AND
FAMILY CELEBRATED THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY. WELL WISHING VICTORIES AND RARE
VIDEO CALLS FOR IN 2021, THEY WATCH FROM HOME AS THEIR
DAUGHTER JESSICA WON A SILVER AND SYNCHRONIZED DIVING. >> WE WERE ON THE COUCH WATCHING IT AT 3:00 IN THE
MORNING AND I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH OTHER THAN BEING AMAZINGLY EMOTIONAL.
>> Reporter: WAS AT THE MOMENT THEY HELD HER MEDAL FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN SHE BROUGHT IT
TO MINNESOTA. >> TO ME IT'S LIKE IT IS THEIR
MEDAL AS WELL. EVERY SINGLE PERSON, ESPECIALLY MY FAMILY WHO HAS ME FROM THE
VERY BEGINNING. >> WE SEE IT IS OUR DAUGHTER RUNNING AROUND AND HAVING FUN
AND FLIPPING OFF THE COUCH AND LIVING ROOM AND THE OLYMPICS IS INCREDIBLE.
>> Reporter: NOW 30, SHE WILL ENTER HER THIRD OLYMPIC GAMES.
AND THIS TIME HER NUMBER ONE FAN AND SO MANY OTHER FAMILIES WILL
GET TO WATCH THEIR FAVORITE ATHLETES GO FOR GOLD FROM THE SAND. WILL IT BE EMOTIONAL FOR YOU?
>> IT IS ALWAYS EMOTIONAL. I WENT TO SEE THEM HAVE FUN AND
DO THEIR BEST AND IF THEY GET A MEDAL, GREAT. >> IF THIS IS HER LAST GO
AROUND, I DON'T WANT TO MISS ONE SECOND OF WHAT SHE'S DOING. >> Reporter: AND YOU GET TO SEE
IT IN PERSON. >> YES. >> MAKING MEMORIES FOR THE ATHLETES AND FAMILIES.
THEY ARE SET TO COMPETE ON WEDNESDAY AND WE WILL BE WATCHING ON NBC AND PEACOCK. >>> LET'S GET TO YOUR "MORNING
NEWS NOW" WEATHER. MILLIONS ARE UNDER ALERTS AND
WE'RE TRACKING AIR QUALITY CONCERNS FOR PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS THE FLAMES WE MENTIONED EARLIER CONTINUE TO SCORCH THE LEFT. MICHELLE GROSSMAN JOINS US.
>>> WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.
FACTOR IN THE HUMIDITY AND IT WILL FEEL LIKE 110 PLUS. AT WEST, WE ARE CONTINUING TO
WATCH THE FIRE THREAT. THE SMOKE IS MOVING TO THE EAST IMPACTING PARTS OF THE NORTHERN
PLAINS AND MIDWEST. IN THE EAST, WE HAVE A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND DORMS. THESE ARE NOT ALL-DAY STORMS
AND SHOWERS BUT UNSETTLED ALL WEEK LONG. WE NEED THE RAIN IN SOME SPOTS.
ALSO, PARTS OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND ALSO NORTHERN NEBRASKA APPEARED LET'S START WITH THE FIRE DANGER. WE HAVE RED FLAGS MORNING AGAIN.
WE ARE REALLY DRY ONCE AGAIN AND HAVE LOTS OF FIRES EARNING IMPACTING THE AIR QUALITY AND THIS WIND IS TURNING THE SMOKE
TO THE PLAINS AND MIDWEST. THE REPORT ALSO OF SOME IN NEW
ENGLAND AS WELL. WE ARE LOOKING AT AIR QUALITY ALERTS WHERE YOU SEE THE ORANGE
SHADING. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE, STAY INDOORS IF YOU ARE NOT
SENSITIVE, KEEP THE WINDOWS AND
DOORS CLOSED AND USE AIR CONDITIONING IF YOU CAN. AVOID THE OUTDOOR AIR IS MUCH AS YOU CAN.
WE HAVE 20 MILLION PEOPLE IMPACTED WITH A HEAT ALERT. WE HAVE WATCH US AND ADVISORIES
INDICATING WE ARE HEATING UP OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
OMAHA, ST. LOUIS, MEMPHIS, DALLAS, JACKSON, INTO THE TRIPLE DIGITS AND MANY SPOTS.
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW. STILL WARM AND PHOENIX 107.
ROSWELL 105. 104 IN WICHITA AND MILWAUKEE 86
AND SIOUX FALLS IN THE 90s AS WELL. WARM THROUGH THE REST OF THE
WEEK AND STILL IN THE TRIPLE
DIGITS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY FOR THAT WARM WEATHER WILL CAUSE SEVERE DORMS -- WE COULD SEE
WHEN A 60 MILES AN HOUR WITH LARGE HAIL AND ALSO A CHANCE OF ISOLATED TORNADOES.
WE CAN SEE SOME STORMS TOMORROW AND THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHTNING AND HEAVY RAIN, THE DARKER COLORS,
AND SOME RAIN IN SOME SPOTS. EXCESSIVE RAIN AND KENTUCKY,
ESPECIALLY WHERE YOU SEE THE REDS AND YELLOWS. WE CAN SEE UP TO 3 INCHES
THROUGH TUESDAY BUT A LOT OF THE EAST COULD SEE LIGHT RAIN. KEEP THE UMBRELLA HANDY FOR THE
NEXT COUPLE DAYS. WE WILL NOT HA DOWNPOURS BUT WE WILL SEE UNSETTLED WEATHER
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. WE HAVE A FRIEND MOVING THROUGH SLOWLY.
IT WILL KEEP US A LITTLE UNSETTLED. AT LEAST MOST OF THE EAST WILL
BE UNSETTLED. >> IT IS AMAZING HOW YOU SEE THE SMOKE FROM THE WILD FIRES
AFFECTING AREAS FROM COAST
>>> AFTER A LEGAL BATTLE THAT HAS LASTED YEARS, I WAS
ABORTION BAN IS SET TO TAKE EFFECT TODAY IT RESTRICTS ABORTION AFTER WHAT IT CALLS A
DETECT DOUBLE HEARTBEAT. THE MEASURE WAS PASSED IN THE
WAKE OF THE DOBBS DECISION THAT ENDED THE PROTECTION OF ROE V.
WADE. THE SUPREME COURT IN IOWA RULED THE BAN COULD GO INTO EFFECT. JOINING US NOW IS NBC NEWS
CORRESPONDENT AND LEGAL ANALYST.
LET'S START WITH YOU. ACCORDING TO THE ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS ABORTION ACCESS,
MORE THAN 4000 ABORTIONS WERE PERFORMED AND IOWA IN 2023. WHAT IMPACT AND RESTRICTIONS IN
IOWA? >> WE COULD SEE A SIGNIFICANT
DROP. YOU TALKED ABOUT 4000 ABORTIONS PERFORMED AND EXPERTS SAY THEY
ARE ALREADY EXPECTING TO SEE THAT NUMBER DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY. WHEN THE NUMBER DECLINE IN
IOWA, THE EXPECTATION THEY ARE ANTICIPATING WOMEN SEEKING ABORTION WILL GO TO SOME OF THE
SURROUNDING AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE IN ILLINOIS. THEY HAVE CREATED AVENUES AND
PATHWAYS FOR THESE WOMEN WHO MAY BE FLEEING THE STATE OF
IOWA. I WANT OUR VIEWERS TO HEAR FROM THE STATE REPRESENTATIVE WHO COAUTHORED THIS BILL WHICH BECOMES LAW IN THE NEXT 30
MINUTES IN THE STATE OF IOWA. SHE SAYS THEY DO HAVE MEASURES IN PLACE FOR WOMEN WHO ARE NOT
ABLE TO GET ABORTIONS. LISTEN. >> WE ANTICIPATE WE WILL SEE A
SURGE IN ILLINOIS AND THE REALITY IS IF WE KNOW ABORTION
RESTRICTIONS DON'T DECREASE, THE NEED FOR ABORTIONS WILL PUT
AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON THE PATIENT. >> THAT WAS JENNIFER WELCH AND
SHE IS WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND SHE WAS DISCUSSING WHAT THEY ARE EXPECTING AND HOW THEY
WILL MOVE FORWARD. MEANWHILE, THERE ARE SOME RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS IF
A WOMAN IS A VICTIM OF RAPE OR INCEST, FOR EXAMPLE. CERTAIN ABORTIONS WILL BE
ALLOWED. >> ANGELA, LET'S GET INTO THE DETAILS OF THE LAW. THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS FOR RATE,
-- RAPE. WHO WILL HAVE TO DECIDE WHEN THE EXCEPTION IS VALID AND HOW
DOES THIS AFFECT PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS? >> THERE ARE SOME LIMITED
MEDICAL EXCEPTION. THE BURDEN IS REALLY HEAVILY BEING PLACED UPON DOCTORS.
EVEN WITH THE EXCEPTIONS, FIRST OF ALL, THEY HAVE TO BE
REPORTED WITHIN 45 DAYS AND INCEST WITHIN 145 DAYS AND THE
DOCTOR WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BEING -- AND SEE WHAT ACTUALLY
HAPPENED AND TO VERIFY. FURTHERMORE, WITH THE ABNORMALITIES INCOMPATIBLE WITH
LIFE AND PHYSICAL ENDANGERMENT OF THE PREGNANT MOTHER, THEY ARE INCREDIBLY SUBJECT TO AND
EVEN THOUGH THE I AM WHAT MEDICAL BOARD HAS PRODUCED GUIDELINES TO GUIDE DOCTORS THROUGH THIS, THEY STILL NOT
POSSIBLY COVER EVERY POSSIBILITY. WHAT THAT MEANS IS DOCTORS HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS AND IF
NOT, THEY FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. BECAUSE DOCTORS DID NOT ENTER THIS PROFESSION TO TOE THAT
LINE OF POSSIBLY BEING PROSECUTED, DOCTORS OVERALL ARE LIKELY GOING TO BE MUCH LESS
WILLING TO PERFORM ABORTIONS EVEN IF THEY CAN POSSIBLY MAKE EXCEPTIONS. >> AS WE HEARD IN YOUR
INTERVIEW WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THEY HAVE SAID THAT EXPANDING ACCESS AND SURROUNDING AREAS IN
ANTICIPATION OF THIS POLICY CHANGE. WHAT KIND OF CHANGES ARE BEING
MADE? >> ONE MAJOR CHANGE, PLANNED PARENTHOOD HAS CLINICS THAT
WERE ADDED WITHIN THE LAST YEAR. BECAUSE OF THE GROWING DEMAND
THAT THEY ARE ANTICIPATING. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE
ABORTION LAWS BY STATE. DARK BLUE IS LEGAL ARE PROTECTED AND YOU SEE THE ORANGE AREA SHOWING
RESTRICTIONS. THAT IS A BIG PORTION OF THE COUNTRY.
FOR EXAMPLE IN ILLINOIS AND MINNESOTA, THEY ARE PREPARING FOR AND INCREASE IN THE NUMBER
OF WOMEN WHO ARE SEEKING ABORTIONS. WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN AND LOOK AT IT, SIX WEEKS IS A TIME FRAME
WHEN SOME WOMEN HAVE NO IDEA THAT THEY ARE PREGNANT. BEFORE, IT WAS AT LEAST 20
WEEKS. THERE ARE PROCEDURES AND PLANS
IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH THIS INCREASE OF PATIENTS. >> WE CONTINUE TO SEE THESE LAWS EVOLVE WITH THIS LAW IN
EFFECT CAN IOWA PASS A LAW TO PURSUE CHARGES AGAINST WOMEN WHO LEAVE THE STATE AFTER SIX WEEKS TO SEEK AN ABORTION? HAVE OTHER STATES TRIED THIS?
>> WE ARE STARTING TO SEE OTHER STATES LIKE TEXAS TRY THIS. IT IS LARGELY IN THE FIELD OF
PREVENTING MINOR TRAFFICKING IN THE NAME OF AN ABORTION BUT I WILL SAY THIS. IF THIS -- THIS WILL GET TO
THE SUPREME COURT. ALL THESE LAWS ARE BEING CHALLENGED.
WHEN THEY GET TO THE SUPREME COURT, I BELIEVE THEY WILL BE DENIED AND OVERTURNED LARGELY BECAUSE EVEN JUSTICE KAVANAUGH
WHO IS PART OF THE CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY, IN THE DECISION THAT OVERTURNED ROE V. WADE, HE
SAID, ANY ATTEMPT AT INTERSTATE TRAVEL BAN ARE BLATANTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND IT IS NOT
EVEN A QUESTION. IT IS BLACK: . -- BLACK AND .
>>> LET'S GET TO INTERNATIONAL NEW STARTING WITH FOLLOW-UP FROM A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
AND VENEZUELA. OUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT HAS A LATEST ON THAT AND OTHER
HEADLINES. >>> NICOLAS MADURO WAS DECLARED
THE WINNER OF THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THEY SAID HE HAD 51% OF THE VOTE
. THE RESULT WAS A BLOW FOR THOSE HOPING FOR AN END TO HIS
PRESIDENCY BUT NOT EVERYONE IS ACCEPTING THE RESULTS. THE OPPOSITION IS CALLING OUT
WHAT THEY SAY ARE IRREGULARITIES AT THE POLLS. EVEN U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE
ANTHONY BLINKEN EXPRESS HIS OWN CONCERNS ABOUT THE RESULTS BUT DESPITE PUSHBACK, HE JOINED THE
CROWD OF SUPPORTERS TO CELEBRATE AND DEMAND RESPECT FOR WHAT HE CALLS THE PEOPLE'S CHOICE. >>> IN THE CONGO, MORE THAN 400
PRISONERS WERE RELEASED FROM THE LARGEST JAIL. THEY ARE ADDRESSING
OVERCROWDING AND MUCH OF THE PRISON WAS BUILT TO HOLD 1500 INMATE IN 1957 BUT RECENTLY
HELD ABOUT 15,000. THE LATEST EFFORTS ARE THANKS TO A DETAINED JOURNALIST TO
SHARE PICTURES OF THE DIRE CONDITIONS. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE
OR MORE ARE EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED, A CONDITIONAL RELEAS , TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS.
>>> FEMALE OLYMPIANS HIT THE
RUNWAY FOR A FASHION SHOW.
CURRENT AND FORMER FEMALE ATHLETES STRUT THEIR STUFF IN THE MOMENT THE GAMES IN PARIS
WERE THE FIRST EVER OLYMPICS WERE WOMEN WERE ALLOWED TO
COMPETE. THERE IS WORK TO DO BUT IN THE MEANTIME, IN THE WORDS OF QUEEN
BEAT, WHO REALLY WANTS -- RUN THE WORLD? GIRLS.
>>> COMING UP, MORE WOMEN DEALING WITH BREAST CANCER
DIAGNOSIS ARE ASKING FOR DOUBLE
>>> NEW DATA SHOWS A DOUBLE
MASTECTOMY MAY NOT IMPROVE SURVIVAL CHANCES FOR WOMEN. THE STUDY LAST WEEK SHOWED WOMEN WHO HAD A TUMOR OR ONE
BREAST REMOVED DID JUST AS WELL COMPARED TO WOMEN WITH A DOUBLE VASECTOMY, THE STUDY DID NOT
COME WITHOUT ITS COMPLICATIONS. SURVIVORS HAD A HIGHER RISK OF DEATH IF THEY -- I FEEL LIKE
EVERYONE KNOWS SOMEONE AFFECTED BY BREAST CANCER. WALK US THROUGH THIS STUDY. THE RESULTS FEEL LIKE A PARADOX.
>> A LOT TO UNPACK. THE REASON I THINK WE THINK
ABOUT A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY MAKING SENSE IS IF YOU HAVE CANCER IN ONE BREAST, BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF RECURRENCE OR
NEW CANCER DEVELOPING, IT IS 7% AND YOU MIGHT THINK, WHY WOULD I WANT TO TAKE THAT CHANCE?
WHY NOT JUST GET THE DOUBLE EFFECT ME?
WHAT THEY FOUND IS AFTER LOOKING OVER 600,000 CANCER PATIENTS, WHO HAD CANCER ON ONE
SIDE, IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO DO ANYTHING TO THE OTHER BREAST.
BY THE WAY, PEOPLE WITH SOME OF
THE SPECIAL BREAST CANCER GENES WE TALKED ABOUT, YOU ARE IN A
DIFFERENT CATEGORY IF YOU HAVE THAT GENETIC --
>> WHAT OPTIONS WOMEN HAVE FROM SPREADING A REOCCURRING?
DO THEY HAVE A CHOICE IN THE TYPE OF TREATMENT THEY RECEIVED? >> THEY DO. EVERY DOCTOR WILL TALK ABOUT
THESE CHOICES INCLUDING THE SURGERY IN THE OTHER BREAST BUT THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS
USUALLY HAVE HORMONE THERAPY AND CHEMO THERAPY IN ADDITION TO ANY THERAPY. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THOSE TO
TEST SIX, 7% OF RECURRENCE, WHAT THEY FOUND IS IT IS LIKELY FROM THAT SAME BREATH, THE
ORIGINAL CANCER SPREADING OR NOT REMOVING IT ALL WITH SURGERY.
AGAIN, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DETECTION. IT WILL HELP PREVENT
ANY SORT OF CANCER RECURRENCE. >> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO
NOTE THAT THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY DOES NOT APPLY TO EVERYONE WHO HAS BREAST CANCER.
DO THEY BELIEVE THOSE PATIENTS WOULD CONSIDER A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY? >> THEY ARE A DIFFERENT GENETIC
RISK. THAT GENETIC RISK PLACES THEM
NOT ONLY AN ADDITIONAL RISK OF RECURRENCE BUT CAN HAVE A HIGHER RISK OF A NEW AND
DIFFERENT KIND OF CANCER. THOSE ARE PATIENTS WHERE CHEMOTHERAPY AND HORMONE
THERAPY AND SURGERY MIGHT HELP.
I THINK, THIS COMES DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT AND THE CONVERSATION WITH YOUR DOCTOR.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>> COMING UP, GETTING INTO AN

THINGS AS WELL AS KEEPING YOUR GRADES UP. IT WAS A LOT OF JUGGLING. AND YOU CANNOT LET ONE THING

SEVENTH. THERE IS A PRETTY COMPRESSED
TIMELINE. THOSE WHO ARE SENT TO RALLY FOR HARRIS OUTSIDE OF PHILADELPHIA. BACK TO YOU.
>> STAYING IN POLITICS, THE CAMPAIGNS ARE SPENDING LOTS OF
TIME IN BATTLEGROUND STATES. THERE ARE BATTLEGROUND COUNTIES THAT CAN BRING THE WHOLE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION.
THE POLLS WERE SHOWING THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE NECK AND NECK.
EXPLAINING HOW THOSE POLLS
COULD CHANGE. >> MORE THAN 3100 COUNTIES WITH
A FINAL 100 DAYS UNTIL ELECTION
DAY. SEVEN DECIDER COUNTIES. EACH ONE TELLS AN IMPORTANT
STORY DEMOGRAPHICALLY ABOUT WHERE THE NATIONAL RACE MAY BE
GOING. WITH KAMALA HARRIS SAID TO REPLACE JOE BIDEN. TWO COUNTIES THAT ARE AMONG
THIS GROUP OF DECIDER COUNTIES. LET'S START IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. THIS IS JUST OUTSIDE OF ATLANTA
IN THE GROWING METRO AREA. GEORGIA, A REPUBLICAN STATE
UNTIL 2020. AFTER GETTING IT FROM THE NARROWEST OF MARGINS.
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN PULLING MUCH BETTER AGAINST BIDEN
BEFORE HARRIS SWITCHED INTO THE RACE.
WITH DEMOCRATS, YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A HUGE EXPANSION OF HER SUPPORT. BLACK VOTERS AND ONE OF THE MOST
RACIALLY DIVERSE COUNTIES. BIDEN HAS BEEN STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT. HARRIS DOES NOT. THIS IS RELATIVE TO WHAT BIDEN
WAS GETTING. IT IS FAST-GROWING, GETTING MORE AND MORE DIVERSE.
IN 2016, IT WAS A SIX POINT RACE. THIS EXPANDED TO 18 POINTS, BIDEN OVER TRUMP.
THEY ARE HOPING TO EXPAND THIS MARGIN EVEN FURTHER.
THE BIG PICTURE HOPE FOR DEMOCRATS YEAR, THAT THE POLLING IN GEORGIA WHICH LOOKS
PARTICULARLY SHADY FOR THEM. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL CHANGE A
STATE LIKE GEORGIA. NOW LOOK AT PENNSYLVANIA.
PENNSYLVANIA IS EXTREMELY CRUCIAL. JUST BECAUSE OF THE SIZE.
THIS POTENTIALLY WILL SHUT OFF FOR THESE CANDIDATES. ONE OF TWO COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA THAT FLIPS IN 2016.
BIDEN IN 2020. PENNSYLVANIA ITSELF IS A STATE
FLIPPED IN 2016 TO BIDEN IN
2020. ONE OF THE KEYS SWING COUNTIES OF THESE SWINGS STAY. THIS HAS A HUGE BLUE-COLLAR
POPULATION. AN AREA OF GROWTH FOR REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. GETTING WORSE AND WORSE HERE
WITH THIS DEMOGRAPHIC. A LARGE REPRESENTATION OF THAT GROUP OF VOTERS AND THE
QUESTION HERE FOR KAMALA
HARRIS, CAN SHE DOING IN A PLACE LIKE ERIE COUNTY
PENNSYLVANIA.
>> THANK YOU, WILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. >>> THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO STOP THE RESPONSE TO

THIS ROCKET BROUGHT DEATH AND DESTRUCTION FOR THIS COMMUNITY

GET TO IT. A MOUNTAIN VILLAGE IN MORNING TODAY FOR MORE YOUNG LIFE'S
LOSS DURING THIS UNFORGIVING WAR. WE SAW AN ANGRY CROWD GATHERING
HERE PROTESTING. THEY BELIEVE THAT BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU AND THE ENTIRE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DO ENOUGH TO PROTECT THESE CHILDREN. ALL OF THIS FIGHTING ON THE
NORTHERN BORDER TRYING TO FINALIZE A CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA.

PHYSICALLY I HAVE MATURED A LOT AS AN ATHLETE.

DISEASE, WE TALK ABOUT THE BUILDUP OF ABNORMAL PROTEINS.
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A WHILE NOW, HOW CAN WE PICK UP
ON THEM EARLIER THAN WE HAVE. SO THAT PEOPLE CAN INTERVENE
EARLIER. WHAT THESE TESTS ARE LOOKING FOR ARE THE PROTEINS IN THE BRAIN ASSOCIATED WITH ALZHEIMER'S. CAN WE FIND THEM IN THE BLOOD?
TO BE SEEN IN THE BRAIN, IT IS AN EXTENSIVE TEST. THIS IS NOW SHOWING 90%
ACCURACY.
REALLY, A LOT OF HOPE ON THE RISE THERE. >> THESE TESTS HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA.
A BIG QUESTION RIGHT NOW, WHAT TESTS CAN WE TRUST? >> THE GOLD STANDARD RIGHT NOW IS THAT YOU SEE YOUR PRIMARY
CARE PHYSICIAN. THERE CAN BE FURTHER TESTING. IT IS HARD TO SAY IF THIS IS
THE GOLD STANDARD.
THIS CAN INCLUDE AN MRI OF THE
BRAIN. OR WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST. FOR NOW, WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS HOW TO SCREEN PEOPLE LIKE
MAMMOGRAMS AND COLONOSCOPIES. THEY CAN POTENTIALLY PICK UP ON THIS DISEASE YEARS BEFORE WE CAN NOW.
>> PATIENT TO PATIENT, WHO SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT BE USING THE BLOOD TEST? >> THE BIG CAUTION RIGHT NOW IS
THAT SOME OF THESE TESTS CAN GET THROUGH ONLINE OR A PRESCRIPTION. THEY ARE NOT COVERED BY
INSURANCE WE DO NOT WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE RELATIVELY YOUNG
FINDING OUT MORE ANALOGIES AND FREAKING OUT AND GETTING ANXIOUS THAT LATER DOWN THE LINE I MIGHT GET MEMORY LOSS.
THESE TESTS ARE NOT USED FOR THAT. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP ALZHEIMER'S.
>> THIS MORNING THE AGENCY APPROVED A BLOOD TESTING
SCREENING FOR COLON CANCER, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT
THAT? >> THE BIG THING WITH COLON CANCER THAT WE DO NOT GET ENOUGH PEOPLE SCREENED. WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR IS A
COLONOSCOPY CAN BE UNCOMFORTABLE. A LOT OF PATIENTS TELL US, I WILL THINK ABOUT IT, I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT.
