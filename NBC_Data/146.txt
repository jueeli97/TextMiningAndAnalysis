WE ARE BACK WITH MORE TOMORROW. THE NEWS CONTINUES WITH HALLIE
JACKSON NOW.
>>> TONIGHT, DRAMATIC AND TERRIFYING NEW PICTURES OF A WILDFIRE IN COLORADO TURNING DEADLY. WITH NEW WARNINGS,
FIRST RESPONDERS ARE RUNNING OUT OF RESOURCES, AND A HEAT WAVE MAKING THINGS WORSE FOR FIREFIGHTERS IN CALIFORNIA.
WE WILL TAKE YOU LIFE OUT WEST WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THOSE FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOMES. >>> A COMBATIVE AND
CONTROVERSIAL APPEARANCE FOR FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AT A CONFERENCE FOR BLACK JOURNALIST, QUESTIONING KAMALA HARRIS HIS
OWN RACIAL IDENTITY AND SUGGESTING ANY PICUS IRRELEVANT TO VOTERS.
>>> PLUS, THE NEW WARNINGS FROM IRAN AFTER THE KILLING OF A HAMAS KILLER AT ITS CAPITAL, WHICH IS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS
FROM HERE YOU THE MARATHON TRIAL OF YOUNG THUG TAKING A
WILD TWIST. MORE ACCUSATIONS OF ANOTHER SECRET MEETING THAT HAS A
DEFENSE CALLING FOR A MISTRIAL. >> THE WEIGHT LOSS DRUG THAT SOME PEOPLE SEE AS A MIRACLE COULD COME WITH A DANGEROUS
SIDE EFFECT. WHAT DOCTORS ARE SAYING ABOUT EATING DISORDERS LATER IN THE SHOW. >>> WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THOSE
WILDFIRES OUT WEST IN A MINUTE. WE BEGIN WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP GETTING COMBATIVE ON
STAGE TODAY AT A CONFERENCE FOR BLACK JOURNALIST. THAT FROM THE JUMP GOT SUPER
TESTY AND CONTENTIOUS WITH MR. TRUMP AT ONE POINT ATTACKING VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS'S RACIAL IDENTITY. LISTEN. >> SHE WAS ALWAYS OF INDIAN
HERITAGE AND SHE WAS ONLY PROMOTING INDIAN HERITAGE, I DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS BLACK
UNTIL A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN SHE HAPPENED TO TURN BLACK AND NOW SHE WANTS BE KNOWN AS BLACK. IS SHE INDIAN, OR A SHE BLACK?
>> YOU CAN HEAR THE AUDIENCE REACTING AS WE ARE SET TO SEE MR. TRUMP BACK IN PENNSYLVANIA IN ABOUT AN HOUR NOW AS HIS
TEAM DEFENSE WHAT HE SAID AND
THAT PANEL. THOSE IN THE HARRIS WORLD DESCRIBING THE INTERVIEW AS A DISASTER. SHE IS GETTING READY TO SPEAK IN TEXAS IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.
HER CAMPAIGN IS FOCUSED ON NEXT WEEK'S REAL DEAL TICKET KICKOFF. THAT IS WHEN SHE IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE A RUNNING MATE AND THEN HIT SOME BATTLEGROUNDS.
THE BOX HERE, UNKNOWN, THAT IS THE QUESTION WHICH FACE FILLS THAT BOX? WILL BE ONE OF THE SIX YOU ARE
ABOUT TO SEE HERE IN THE RUNNING FOR THAT JOB AND BEING VETTED IN THE CONVERSATION WITH SEVERAL INDICATING THEY REALLY
WANT IT, PUTTING UP VIDEOS OVER THE LAST 18 HOURS FOR THEM PUMPING UP THE BIOGRAPHIES,
PUMPING UP THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS. KELLY O'DONNELL IS AT THE WHITE
HOUSE, BUT WE START WITH GARRETT HAKKE IN PENNSYLVANIA WITH ARMOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. THAT CONFERENCE STARTED A HOUR AND CHANGE LATE AND IT ENDED
EARLY BECAUSE THE FORMER PRESIDENT WANTED TO GET TO HARRISBURG, WHERE YOU ARE. WHAT WE SAW AFTER THOSE
CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS IS THE TRUMP CAMP DOING WHAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT OFTEN DOES, NOT BACKING DOWN AND ESSENTIALLY GOING AFTER THE
MEDIA. >> Reporter: I THINK THAT IS
RIGHT. THIS WAS COMBATIVE AND CONTENTIOUS, EVEN BY TRUMP STANDARDS REALLY GOING AFTER
THE MODERATORS AND MAKING SOME, FRANKLY, WILD CLAIMS ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS'S RACIAL IDENTITY.
TRUMP WAS IN THAT ROOM BECAUSE HE DOES NOT NEED TO WIN LACK VOTERS, HE DOES NOT NEED TO WIN
BY UNSPECTACULAR MARGIN, HIS CAMPAIGN BELIEVES IF THEY CAN PULL OFF A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF BLACK MEN THEY CAN PULL OFF A COUPLE OF PLACES THAT ELUDED
THEM IN THE 2020 ELECTION. WILL DELPHIA, DETROIT, MILWAUKEE THEY CAN DO JUST WELL ENOUGH IN THOSE PLACES THAT HE COULD BE PRESIDENT. I THINK THE MESSAGE HE MEANT TO
DELIVER IS EQUALLY I RACING BUT SLIGHTLY MORE TO HIS ECONOMIC
POINT, THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS IMMIGRATION POLICIES TO AFRICAN
AMERICANS NATIONWIDE. LISTEN TO THIS COMMENT WHICH ALSO DREW A LOT OF ATTENTION FROM THAT SAME SPEECH.
>> COMING FROM THE BORDER ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
THAT HAPPEN TO BE TAKING BLACK JOBS. >> WHAT EXACTLY IS A BLACK JOB,
SIR? >> A BLACK JOB IS ANYBODY WHO HAS A JOB. THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
>> Reporter: I TALKED TO A AFRICAN AMERICAN TRUMP VOTER IN HARRISBURG TODAY WHO ECHOED THAT TALKING POINT. IT IS SOMETHING IS VERY
CONCERNED THAT THE FLOW OF
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COULD AFFECT THE ECONOMY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT HIM AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM. THAT IS SOMETHING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WANTS TO GET OUT. DONALD TRUMP EMBRACED HIS OWN
REMARKS. THEY SAID HE DID GREAT DESPITE RUDE INTERFERENCE. THE REST OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS MORE CONCERNED.
LARRY HOGAN RUNNING FOR SENATE IN MARYLAND WENT TO TWITTER SAYING GOING AFTER SOMEONE'S
RACIAL IDENTITY IS THE KIND OF THING THAT SHOULD BE OUT OF BOUNCE. OBVIOUSLY HE IS NOT ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP AND KEEPING DISTANCE FROM HIM, WILL BE GOOD
FOR HIM. >> GARY, STANDBY. KELLY, LET ME GET TO YOU GET IN THE WAY THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT'S TEAM IS RESPONDING.
>> THEY ARE POINTING OUT BIG THINGS THAT THEY THINK REPRESENT WHO DONALD TRUMP REALLY IS. SAYING THAT HIS APPEARANCE AT THE NAB J
CONFERENCE REFLECTS THE HOSTILITY THAT HE HAS SHOWN TWO
BLACK JOURNALISTS, BLACK CITIZENS, AND TO THE COUNTRY AND MANY OTHER INSTANCES AND
THAT HE JUST REVEALED MORE OF HIMSELF IN THIS EXCHANGE. THEY FOUND IT INSULTING AND RUDE
. THEY ALSO CERTAINLY ARE VERY STRONGLY SAYING THAT THIS WAS A TIRADE OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT
DOING WHAT HE DOES. THAT WAS MET WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
FURTHER EMBRACING WHAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY. IN SOME WAYS, BOTH CAMPAIGNS
ARE GETTING SOME MILEAGE OUT OF THIS. CERTAINLY, DONALD TRUMP AT ONE POINT, WHEN KAMALA
HARRIS WAS RUNNING FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, HE DONATED TO HER, AND YET HE CLAIMED TO NOT KNOW
ABOUT HER RACIAL IDENTITY AND HER ETHNIC HERITAGE, AS IF IT CAN ONLY BE ONE THING. SO MANY
AMERICANS COME FROM MULTIPLE ETHNIC AND RACIAL AND CULTURAL
BACKGROUNDS, THAT IS WHAT A MELTING POT TENDS TO BE. THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN SEES THIS
AS REVEALING DONALD TRUMP IN HIS TEMPERAMENT, IN HIS REAL
VIEWS, IN HIS APPROACH TO DEALING WITH OTHERS, INCLUDING THE BLACK JOURNALIST ON STAGE, INCLUDING BLACK CITIZENS BY
TALKING ABOUT BLACK JOBS, THEY
WOULD ARGUE THAT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS CURRENTLY A BLACK JOB. THIS IS ABOUT HIGHLIGHTING THE FACT THAT THEY BELIEVE THERE IS
ALWAYS, IF NOT AN OBVIOUS, UNDERCURRENT OF CHALLENGING HER
ON HER IDENTITY THAT THEY THINK WILL GALVANIZE VOTERS ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND WILL HELP TO CREATE MORE ENERGY.
THEY ALSO, OF COURSE, WOULD LIKE TO SEE A DEBATE WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS AND SHE HAS
TALKED ABOUT THAT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY IT, SEND IT TO MY FACE. TODAY'S EVENT COULD BRING OUT
MORE OF THAT. >> YOU ALSO SAW MR. TRUMP, GARRETT, FACING QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS RUNNING MATE, JD VANCE AND
THOSE QUESTIONS FROM 2021 ABOUT SO-CALLED CHILDLESS CAT LADIES
INSIDE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAID, EITHER THAN A LITTLE MOMENTUM
BUMP IN A FEW DAYS HEN YOU ANNOUNCE A VP CANDIDATE, IT
DOES NOT REALLY MEMBER COME NOVEMBER. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION ON VANS AND NOT OF IT
POSITIVE. >> Reporter: IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS
ASKED IF JD VANCE WOULD BE READY TO TAKE OVER A DAY ONE AS VICE PRESIDENT OR PRESIDENT IF NEEDED TO COME HE DID NOT
ADDRESS THE POINT OF THE QUESTION, REALLY THE ONE JOB THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY HAS. NOT A STRONG EMBRACE OF DONALD
TRUMP OF HIS VICE PRESIDENT, WHOM, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, HE VIEWS IT AS A
SPOKESMAN FOR HIS OWN CAMPAIGN AS A CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER OF HIS OWN KIND HERE OUT TO DO A
VERY SPECIFIC JOB FOR HIM. VANCE, I THINK SO FAR, HAS MOSTLY BEEN NET NEGATIVE FOR
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THEY UNDERSTOOD SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT THOROUGHLY VETTED BY THE
NATIONAL MEDIA THEY WOULD HAVE BAD NEWS CYCLES COMING OUT OF THE GATE. IN THE NEXT 97 DAYS OR SO, DOES
VANCE SHAKE OFF HIS PAST COMMENTS AND TURN INTO AN EFFECTIVE MESSENGER FOR TRUMP AND EFFECTIVE ATTACK DOG
AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS WHICH GIVES THE VP IN A TRADITIONAL
CAMPAIGN. HE IS OUT WEST NOW, HE WILL BE AT THE BORDER TOMORROW AND
HIGHLIGHT THAT ISSUE. I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE
INTERESTING TO SEE IF VANCE CAN SHAKE OFF THESE COMMENTS. SOME OF THESE ARE SEVERAL YEARS OLD, OR WILL HE GET BOGGED DOWN IN DEFENDING THINGS THAT HE
SAID EVEN BEFORE HE WAS A SENATOR. >> GARRETT HAKKE, LIVE FOR US AND HARRISBURG.
THANK YOU. KELLY, I WANT TO GO TO YOU, VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS IS PICKING HER OWN RUNNING MATE,
SHE'S LOOKING AT A SLEW OF PEOPLE INCLUDING MINNESOTA GOVERNOR TIM WALZ, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG, PENNSYLVANIA
GOVERNOR JOSH SHAPIRO OR ARIZONA SENATOR MARK KELLY. LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION YOU HAVE HURT 7 BILLION TIMES IN
THE PAST WEEK AND WHAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR UNTIL SHE ANNOUNCES IT, WHERE DO THINGS STAND ON THIS FRONT?
>> Reporter: THE PROCESS IS MOVING FORWARD. WE AT LEAST KNOW WHEN WE WILL SEE THEM TOGETHER AND THAT IS
NEXT TUESDAY. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS AND HER SOON-TO-BE NAME RUNNING MATE WILL APPEAR IN PHILADELPHIA AND WILL DO A SERIES OF STOPS
TOGETHER IN CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND AREAS. THE SELECTION PROCESS, THIS
PARTICULAR CYCLE, DEMOCRATS HAVE A DEEPER BENCH THEN YOU MIGHT FIND IN SOME YEARS, IT IS
ALWAYS SORT OF AN ACCIDENT OF TIMING. THERE ARE GOVERNORS WHO HAVE STRONG RECORDS, THERE IS A
SENATOR WHO CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THE IMMIGRATION AND BORDER POLICY BACKUP AND COMPLEMENT TO
HARRIS. THE WORK HAS BEEN GOING ON, THE CANDIDATES IN THE SENSE OF THOSE BEING CONSIDERED
CONTENDERS, PERHAPS, HAVE BEEN USING OPPORTUNITIES TO DO MEDIA
AND MAKE APPEARANCES AND DO EVENTS AS A BIT OF A DRESS
REHEARSAL, AUDITION, IF YOU WILL. THEY WILL ALL REMAIN IMPORTANT
SURROGATES THROUGH ELECTION DAY, ULTIMATELY THE ONE CHOSEN WILL BE A PARTNER ON PERHAPS THE DEBATE STAGE, AGAINST JD
VANCE AND CERTAINLY AT THE CONVENTION. WE EXPECT TO HEAR BY TUESDAY, PERHAPS A LITTLE IN ADVANCE OF
THAT OF THOSE WHO ARE REALLY IN THE KNOW RE SAYING THE LEAST ABOUT IT YET
>> THAT IS TYPICALLY HOW IT GOES. THERE IS ALSO A KEY ENDORSEMENT THAT THE HARRIS TEAM IS PICKING UP TODAY. >> UNITED AUTO WORKERS.
THAT IS IMPORTANT. THAT IS THE KIND OF LANE THAT JOE BIDEN OCCUPIED SO MUCH WITH HIS SUPPORT FOR UNIONS.
CERTAINLY SHE HAS A HISTORY OF THAT AS WELL. IS A SIGNIFICANT. WE ALSO KNOW MANY OF THE RANK-
AND-FILE MEMBERS OF THE BIG UNIONS HAVE BEEN THE KINDS OF VOTERS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS TRIED TO ATTRACT AND HAS HAD
SOME SUCCESS WITH THAT. THE UNIONS THEMSELVES, AND THEIR ORGANIZATION AND THEIR
ABILITY TO TURN OUT VOTES CAN BE VERY HELPFUL ESPECIALLY IN BATTLEGROUND STATES LIKE
MICHIGAN, LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, LIKE WISCONSIN WHERE MEMBERS RESIDE. THEY TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT
SHE HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF UNIONS, AND THEY WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF HER. >> KELLY O'DONNELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH. >>> TAKING YOU OUT WEST AS WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR WITH A
SCARY NEW WARNING. THE ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST
RESCUERS TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT HAS BECOME A DEADLY WILDFIRE IN COLORADO WITH
RESOURCES SPREAD THIN IN THE BOULDER AND DENVER AREAS. YOU'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE IMAGES. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES, SOME OF THEM
IN THE DARK. MULTIPLE HOUSES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED. OFFICIAL SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT WHAT IS NEXT.
>> EVERYTHING IS STACKED AGAINST THIS. WE HAVE LOW RESOURCES, WE HAVE TREACHEROUS TERRAIN, WE HAVE
FLAMMABLE FUEL, BUT WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS ON IT.
>> IT IS NOT JUST COLORADO, ANOTHER NEW FIRE NORTH OF FRESNO AND CALIFORNIA IS THREATENING TWO BUILDINGS, TWO COUNTIES ARE EVACUATED AND THE
HEAT WAVE ABOUT TO HIT IS MAKING THE MASSIVE PARK FIRE IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN THE STATE'S HISTORY, WITH
OFFICIALS DESCRIBING NEAR RECORD LEVELS OF DRYNESS FUELING THESE FIRES.
STEVE PATTERSON THIS OUT IN IT.
LET'S START WITH COLORADO, THERE THE SITUATION HAS FLARED UP IN A BIG WAY BECOMING DEADLY AND VERY SCARY. >> Reporter: IT HAS.
COREY STONE CANYON, ALEXANDRA MAUND AND CURRY CRANK, THESE
ARE ALL THE NAMES OF WILDFIRES BUT IT SPEAKS OF THE FACT OF WHAT EVERY DEPARTMENT REALLY ACROSS THE AMERICAN WEST IS
FACING. ARE NOT JUST LOOKING AT ONE FIRE, IT IS NOT JUST TWO FIRES IT IS THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE
CHURNING THROUGH THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF FRESH BONE DRY FUEL.
FIRE PRONE CONDITIONS ARE PERFECT RIGHT NOW. AS THE WEATHER HEATS UP IT IS GOING TO GET EVEN WORSE. WHICH IS HEARD FROM THE
JEFFERSON COUNTY SHERIFF AND HE SAID QUOTE, EVERYTHING IS STACKED AGAINST US.
YOU COULD HEAR THE DESPERATION THERE BECAUSE THE RESOURCES ARE SPREAD SO THIN. IT IS NOT THAT THE STATES ARE NOT PREPARED OR DO NOT HAVE THE
RESOURCES OR DO NOT HAVE THE MANPOWER, YOU CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH WHEN SO MUCH IS ON FIRE.
THAT REALLY IS THE THREAT. IT IS NOT ONLY AN COLORADO, OBVIOUSLY AFFECTING THE SITUATION THERE ABOUT THE
DEATH, 600 EVACUATED AT ONE FIRE. THERE WILL BE THOUSANDS MORE ACRES THAT ARE AT THREAT AS HIS
FIRE CHURNS THROUGH AND AS TEMPERATURES HEAT UP. THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH MANPOWER THE GOVERNMENT JUST ACTIVATED THE NATIONAL GUARD, THAT WILL
HELP RELIEVE SOME OF THIS. AS THE FIRE CONTINUES THEY WILL NEED MORE.
>> TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND YOU. IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW YOU'RE BRACING FOR A HEAT WAVE, POTENTIAL FOR TRIPLE DIGIT TEMPERATURES WHICH WILL BE SO
BRUTAL FOR THE FIREFIGHTERS WERE MANAGING BOTH THE HEAT AND THE NEAR RECORD LEVELS OF DRYNESS. IT IS A LOT OF FUEL.
>> YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WITH THIS FIRE,
THIS IS DAY SEVEN, FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS FOR A WEEK STRAIGHT, SOME OF THEM FROM 24, 36 HOURS TRYING TO
PUSH THE FLAMES BACK. THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
TO USE THEIR TIME WISELY, 80% CONTAINMENT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH TO TALK ABOUT A FIRE LITERALLY THE SIZE OF LOS ANGELES, IT DOES MATTER AND IT
IS SIGNIFICANT. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE IN THIS TIME, SINCE FRIDAY OR SO THE WEATHER HAS
BEEN GOOD, IT HAS BEEN COOL IN THE MORNING ALLOWING FIREFIGHTERS TO MAKE PROGRESS. THAT COOLER TEMPERATURE BASE HELPS FIREFIGHTERS PUSH THE
LINE FORWARD. NOW THIS FIRE IS MOSTLY BURNING
IN A WILDLAND AREA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRE ZONE. IT IS AWAY FROM HOMES AND
BUSINESSES, IT IS AWAY FROM POPULATION CENTERS, IT IS AWAY FROM PLACES THAT OFFICIALS FEA . ALL OF THAT CHANGES AGAIN
WITH ANOTHER HEAT WAVE COMING IN. THE CONDITIONS FOR THE FIRE ARE EASY, HIGHER TEMPERATURES, LOW
HUMIDITY AND ANY SORT OF WIND.
ALL OF THAT IS IN THE FORECAST, FIREFIGHTERS ARE DOING ALL THAT THEY CAN'T TO TRY TO SHORE THIS UP AND PUSH IT FARTHER BACK
BEFORE THE HOT TEMPERATURES ARRIVE AND THIS COULD EXPLODE AGAIN. ALL IT TAKES IS ONE SPARK.
>> STEVE PATTERSON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR >>> OVERSEAS, A NEW WARNING FROM IRAN SUPREME LEADER ADDED
TO THE TINDERBOX IN THE MIDDLE EAST PLEDGING TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THE HAMAS TOP
POLITICAL OFFICIAL WITH IRAN AND HAMAS BLAMING ISRAEL FOR THE ATTACK THAT KILLED HIM INTO RON.
THIS IS ONE OF HAMAS'S MOST SENIOR LEADERS AND A KEY FIGURE IN THE CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS.
ISRAEL MADE NO MENTION ABOUT THE THING THE WORLD IS TALKING ABOUT NOTHING IF ISRAEL HAD ANY ROLE IN THE ASSASSINATION. ISRAELIS ARE TAKING CREDIT ON
THE STRIKE HOURS EARLIER THAT KILLED A HEZBOLLAH COMMANDER BEIRUT. BOTH ATTACKS ARE RAISING
CONCERNS ABOUT MORE CONFLICT IN THE REGION. MATT BRADLEY IS JOINING US NOW.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS KILLING AND TEHRAN OF THIS TOP HAMAS LEADER, POLITICAL LEADER NOT MILITARY LEADER WHICH IS AN
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION. THE QUESTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE,
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR CEASE-FIRE NEGOTIATIONS FOR FREEING HOSTAGES THAT ARE STILL BEING HELD IN GAZA?
>> Reporter: IT REALLY MAKES IT MORE COMPLICATED. IN FACT, WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD
FROM THE PRIME MINISTER OF QATAR WHO HAS BEEN ONE OF THE IMPORTANT MEDIA AREAS NOT JUST
BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS THAT THE U.S. IS INVOLVED IN, BUT
ALL SORTS OF NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES, THEY ARE IMPORTANT DIPLOMATICALLY. OVER X, FORMALLY KNOWN AS
TWITTER, HOW CAN YOU CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS WITH ISRAEL IS ASSASSINATING THE NEGOTIATORS.
IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE AS VERSUS CONCERN. THIS IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION BECAUSE HAMAS HAD NO TRUST IN
THE ISRAELIS, VERY LITTLE TRUST IN THE AMERICANS AND THEY CONSIDER IT TO BE THE PATRON OF
THE ISRAELIS. NOW TOP LEVEL PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS, AS FAR
AS QATAR IS CONCERNED MAY HAVE HAD SOME LEVEL OF GOODWILL IN
TRYING TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION AT LEAST BRINGING A MAJOR PIECE TO THE GAZA STRIP.
ISRAELIS ARE CONTENDING TO TARGET THEM AND IT BECOMES A NONSTARTER. I THINK WE WILL SEE THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WHERE WE
ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THESE NEGOTIATIONS. THIS IS THE THING, THIS IS NOT NEWS THIS IS THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN.
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE BASICALLY DONE TO BEGIN WITH. THEY HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR 10
MONTHS AND THEY GOT VERY LITTLE DISTANCE DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CIA CHIEF, ANTHONY BLINKEN
THE SECRETARY OF STATE, AND NUMEROUS OTHER DIPLOMATS WERE SHUTTLING BACK AND FORTH TO THE REGION. THE U.S. WAS POURED SO MUCH INTO THIS AND SO FAR IT HAS
COME TO NOTHING. IT MIGHT NOT MEET ISRAEL AND ITS ASSASSINATIONS HELP.
>> IN SOMEONE'S THIS APPEARS TO BE IN THE EYES OF SOME EXPERTS,
THE IDEA OF THE ISRAELI STRATEGY OF THE 70s GOING AFTER LEADERS OF TERROR GROUPS ONE BY ONE. CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THE
TACTICS? >> Reporter: I MEAN, THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE ALREADY
STARTED TO SEE. IT IS A BIT DIFFERENT. WHAT WE SAW AFTER THE OLYMPICS
IN MUNICH, AGAIN, WE ARE SEEING THE OLYMPICS NOW, THERE WERE CONCERNS FOR LATE FOR US HERE IN
NBC THERE COULD BE A TERROR ATTACK BECAUSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THIS IS AN ACUTE CONCERN WHEN
IT COMES TO ANY HIGH PROFILE EVENT IN WHICH THE ISRAELIS ARE PARTICIPATING. NOW WE ARE SEEING THE SAME SENSE OF VENGEANCE THAT WE SAW
AFTER THOSE OLYMPICS IN THE EARLY 1970S. IN FACT, ACCORDING TO ISRAELI MEDIA, WE HAVE NOT CHECKED THIS
OUT OURSELVES BECAUSE IT IS VERY SECRETIVE, THE SHIN BET HAS FORMED A UNIT CALLED A,
WHICH IS AN ACRONYM THAT BORROWS ITS NAME FROM A GROUP OF PARAMILITARIES THAT OPPOSE
THE OTTOMAN RULE THEY HAVE NOW
BETWEEN THE TWO. HE SAID WE ARE MAKING CHOICES BASED ON WHAT THE ECONOMY LOOKS LIKE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE ECONOMY MIGHT HANDLE A RATE CUT
AS SOON AS SEPTEMBER. >> BRIAN, WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU THEN AND BEFORE THEN. >>> BOWING OUT WITH SPLITS
GREEN NEWS NAMING THEIR NEW CEO ANNOUNCING RECORD LOSSES ON THE
OTHER HAND. HAVE INDUSTRY VETERAN ROBERT KELLY WHO IS SET TO REPLACE THE
OUTGOING CEO NEXT WEEK.
BOWING HOPING TO STOP THE BLEEDING, SO TO SPEAK AFTER REPORTING A LOSS OF NEARLY $1.5 BILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER. CALHOUN IS STEPPING DOWN AFTER
NOT SO GREAT YEAR FOR BOEING STARTING IN JANUARY WHEN THE DOOR BLEW OFF THE ALASKA
AIRLINES 737 MAX NINE PLANE. THE STARLINER SPACESHIP IS STILL DOCKED AT THE SPACE STATION WITH ASTRONAUTS UNABLE
TO RETURN AFTER ENGINE THRUSTER PROBLEMS. THEY CAN, THEY ARE TRYING TO GET A FIXED. TOM COSTELLO JOINS US.
NECEO. IS THIS GOING TO TURN THE FORTUNE AROUND?
>> HE HAS A TOUGH JOB. EVERY SINGLE UNIT OF BOEING HAS STRUGGLED. COMMERCIAL AIRLINES WITH MAX EIGHT AND MAX NINE, TWO FATAL
CRASHES OVERSEAS. BY THE WAY NTSB HEARINGS AFTER THAT.
LOOK AT THE SPACE DIVISION OF THE STARLINER STILL DOCKED TO THE SPACE STATION, ASTRONAUTS
COULD IN AN EMERGENCY RETURN HOME. I GOT TO SAY, YOU HAVE BEEN THERE SIX WEEKS AND YOU CANNOT GET HOME, REALLY? YOU CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT BUT
THEY CANNOT GET OUT OF THERE. WE ARE WAITING FOR NASA AND BOEING TO GIVE US A TIMELINE FOR WHEN THEY COULD RETURN AND
NASA OR BOEING IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER BUDGET ON THAT DIVISION. AND CAN I TELL YOU THE MILITARY
IS STRUGGLING IN BOEING. THEY HAVE TROUBLES ACROSS THE
BOARD. THIS NEW CEO HAS A BIG JOB AHEAD. >> WHAT IS FIRST ON THE LIST? >> FIRST OF ALL HE'S MOVING THE
HEADQUARTERS, MOVING BACK TO SEATTLE FROM RIGHT ACROSS THE RIVER IN ARLINGTON.
THEY MOVED HERE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CATER TO THE MILITARY, THE PENTAGON IS RIGHT HERE. BY DOING THAT THEY TOOK THE EYE
OFF THE BALL AND THE BALL IS OF COURSE COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, THAT IS THE BREAD AND BUTTER.
IN ENGINEERING, THEY LOST FOCUS IN ENGINEERING, SO THE ARGUMENT GOES. HE IS A VETERAN AEROSPACE
ENGINEER, 35 YEARS IN THE BUSINESS. HE IS BRINGING ALL OF THE HEADQUARTERS, OPERATIONS, AT LEAST IN RELATION TO COMMERCIAL
AIRCRAFT BACK TO SEATTLE. SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS INTERESTING, HE IS 64 YEARS OLD.
BOEING HAS A MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE OF 65. THE BOARD IS WAIVING THAT. >> INCLUDING FOR TOP LEADERS?
>> THEY DECIDED THEY NEED THIS
GUY, HE COMES FROM ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL AND WE ARE GOING TO WAIVE THAT MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE. THAT WILL BE THE CHALLENGE. HE HAS TO DO A LOT OF WORK AND
REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF YOU, OF ME, AND OF AIRLINES, WHICH ARE THE REAL CUSTOMERS.
>> NOT TO DERAIL THIS, CAN YOU GO BACK TO THE SPACE STATION SITUATION FOR SECOND. THE WHOLE THING IS THEY ARE THERE, THEY COULD GET BACK IF
THEY WANT TO BUT THEY ARE GIVING THEMSELVES MORE TIME TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIX THE ENGINE THRUSTER ISSUE WHILE THERE UP THERE. IS THAT STILL THE OPERATIVE
THINKING? >> THAT IS STILL THE THINKING. >> YOU SOUND SKEPTICAL PERIODS >> 6-7 WEEKS AGO BOEING AND
NASA SAID DO NOT CALL THEM STUCK. THEY COULD COME HOME AND THEY WILL PROBABLY COME HOME IN A COUPLE WEEKS. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE
FOR NINE, 10 DAYS, THEY HAVE BEEN THERE 50 PLUS DAYS AND WE
ARE STILL WAITING FOR THEM TO DO A FULL THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF ALL OF THE THRUSTER ISSUES FOR THEY SAY, IT IS SAFE TO COME
BACK IN THAT SPACESHIP. AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU HAVE TO SAY, IF THEY ARE NOT STUCK, WHAT YOU CALLING IT?
A DELAYED STAY WITH A ROOM WITH A VIEW BUT WE ARE NOT STUCK.,.
AT A CERTAIN POINT THEY HAVE TO GET THIS BACK SAFELY. >> OF OF YOU AND THAT ROOM FOR
SURE . SOME BY THE WAY, STILL WEARING OTHER PEOPLE'S UNDERWEAR. >> THANK YOU, TOM COSTELLO.
WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ONTO OTHER NEWS. WE LOVE YOU AND APPRECIATE IT. WE MOVE ONTO YOUNG THUG NEWS.
WHY THIS TRIAL IS GETTING EVEN WILDER. >> A PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE, WE WILL SHOW YOU THIS, THI THE SPACE?
>> STAY TUNED NOW WEEKNIGHTS AT 8:00 EASTERN, 5:00 PACIFIC ON
NBCNEWS NOW. >> TO A NEW TWIST AND GEORGIA'S
LONGEST RUNNING CRIMINAL TRIAL. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS FOR YOUNG THUG SAID THEY HAVE LEARNED OF
ANOTHER SECRET MEETING BETWEEN PROSECUTORS AND THE FORMER JUDGE.
THIS WAS AFTER DRAMATIC SCENES IN COURT WEEKS AGO WHEN THE DEFENSE FOUND OUT ABOUT A DIFFERENT SECRET MEETING THE FIRST TIME AROUND. MOMENTS THAT WENT VIRAL.
YOU ARE SEEING IT HERE, YOUNG THUGS LAWYER WAS ORDERED TO SPEND WEEKENDS IN JAIL FOR
CONTEMPT. THE JUDGE ENDED UP BEING REMOVED ALTOGETHER. NOW THE DEFENSE TEAM WANTS A
MISTRIAL CALLING THE CASE IRREVOCABLY TAINTED. YOUNG THUG, REAL NAME JEFFREY WILLIAMS IS FACING CHARGES THAT
HE LED A ATLANTA-BASED CRIMINAL GANG AND OVERSAW CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER, AND ROBBERY.
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THE DEFENSE GETS THE MISTRIAL THAT THEY WANT AFTER UNREELING THIS
SECRET MEETING BETWEEN THE JUDGE THAT USED TO OVERSEE THIS CASE AND THE PROSECUTOR? >> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT
OBSERVERS HAVE BEEN CAPTIVATED BY THIS CASE ARE DEBATING RIGHT NOW. WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR IS JUDGE PAGE WHITAKER, THE NEW JUDGE
WHO HAS TAKEN JUDGE LANDFILLS ROLE, SHE DENIED ALL THE
EMOTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD SO FAR THAT SHE HAS GOTTEN A CHANCE TO SEE ANY SORT OF MISTRIAL.
THIS ONE, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO HAVE THE MOST MEAT TO IT. IT SEEMS TO INDICATE A PATTERN
THAT THE JUDGE WAS HAVING THESE SECRET MEETINGS WITH PROSECUTORS AND NOW DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARE BRINGING UP, LISTEN, THE FIRST TIME THAT FOR
SECRET MEETING THAT WAS CONDUCTED ON JUNE 10th WAS
BROUGHT UP, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT LENGTH, WHY WAS IT NEVER BROUGHT UP IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS THAT THERE WAS NOW
ANOTHER SECRET MEETING THAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 7th. ESSENTIALLY, WHAT DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARE TRYING TO SAY, IS
EVERYTHING THAT THE JUDGE RULED ON AND ALL THE DECISIONS HE MADE IN THE 19 MONTHS PRIOR TO HIM
BEING RECUSED FROM THE CASE SHOULD BE CALLED INTO QUESTION. NOT JUST THAT, WHEN THE FIRST
SECRET MEETING WAS REVEALED BY THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY, BRIAN STEELE, THAT THE CASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT ON PAUSE AND THAT
JUDGE LANDFILLS DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT AND NOT TO WAIT FOR THE OTHER JUDGE TO COME IN AND DECIDE IF HE WAS GOING TO BE
RECUSED, HE CONTINUED TO ALLOW THE JURY TO LISTEN TO WITNESS TESTIMONY FOR FOUR DAYS.
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARE SAYING THAT IS TAINTED TESTIMONY. THERE IS A REALLY HIGH ARE WHEN IT COMES TO A JUDGE DECLARING A
MISTRIAL. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AN UNPRECEDENTED CASE, ANYTHING IS
POSSIBLE. >> THE DID THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW JUGS JUDGE SLOWDOWN THIS
TRIAL, THIS IS ALREADY THE SLOWEST RUNNING TRIAL. >> I THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION
THAT EVERYONE IS WATCHING, SHE SEEMED TO INDICATE WHEN THE CHILD PICKED UP THAT SHE WANTS
TO MOVE QUICKLY. SHE IS HOPING THAT IT WILL NOT TAKE ANOTHER SEVEN MONTHS, SHE IS PREPARED IF IT DOES. THE PROSECUTORS HAVE ANOTHER
105 WITNESSES THAT THEY WANT TO CALL TO THE STAND. JUDGE WHITAKER HAS MOVED SWIFTLY
MAKING TWO DECISIONS, ONE WAS TO NOT ALLOW YOUNG THUG TO BOND OUT OF JAIL. HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WERE
TRYING TO ARGUE THAT HE HAS BEEN BEHIND BARS SINCE MAY 2022 AND ALL A LOT OF THE DELAYS HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM HE IS NOT A FLIGHT RISK. BUT JUDGE WHITAKER DENIED THAT
REQUEST TO BOND OUT.
SHE ALSO DENIED THE PROSECUTION'S REQUEST TO PUT A GAG ORDER ON THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND NOT ALLOW THEM TO SPEAK PUBLICLY OR TO THE MEDIA
ABOUT THIS CASE IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE TWO DECISIONS THAT SHE MOVED SWIFTLY ON, EVERYONE IS
HOPING THAT THIS CASE COULD BE WRAPPED UP KIND OF QUICKLY.
IT HAS BEEN THE LONGEST TRIAL IN GEORGIA HISTORY. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >>> LET'S GET YOU TO THE FIVE
THINGS OUR TEAM THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. RESCUERS IN INDIA ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE AFTER THE LANDSLIDES THAT WE TOLD YOU ABOUT HAVE
KILLED MORE THAN 150 ACCORDING TO POLICE. LOOK AT ALL THAT MUD. PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING PULLED
OUT BY CREWS.

>> NUMBER FIVE, A MAN IN MISSOURI IS OUT OF PRISON AFTER 34 YEARS AFTER A JUDGE OVERTURN HIS MURDER CONVICTION EARLIER THIS MONTH. THIS IS CHRISTOPHER DUNN
WALKING OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES. HE SAID HE WAS NOT
INVOLVED IN THE KILLING OF A 15- YEAR-OLD BACK IN 1990. THE JUDGE OVERTURNED THE CONVICTION AGREED.

>> Reporter: WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SHOCKED CYNTHIA. IT CHANGED THE WAY I LOOKED AT
FOOD, HOW I FELT, WHAT I WAS THINKING COMPLETELY.
WITH THE BINGE EATING IT ALMOST COMPLETELY TOOK IT AWAY. >> Reporter: SHOULD BEGAN SKIPPING MEALS, EATING AS LITTLE AS 500 CALORIES A DAY WITH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES.
>> I DID EXPRESS MY BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS DROP BECAUSE I WAS NOT EATING ENOUGH AND I WAS NOT EATING FREQUENTLY ENOUGH.
THE FIRST TIME THAT I FAINTED I WAS ON THE SUBWAY. IT BECAME MORE IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN THE WEIGHT LOSS AND CONTINUE TO LOSE WEIGHT.
>> Reporter: DOCTORS SAY CYNTHIA AS PART OF AN EMERGING TREND OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE DEVELOPED EATING DISORDERS OR SEEN THEM WORSENED SINCE STARTING TO MEDICATIONS WHICH
INCLUDE DRUGS LIKE WEGOVY OR OZEMPIC. >> WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE OF
NEW ONSET EATING DISORDERS OR WORSENING OF CURRENT EATING DISORDERS BASED OFF THE USE OF THESE DRUGS.
>> Reporter: DR. THOMAS HILDEBRANDT CHIEF OF THE EATING DISORDERS AT MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SAYS HE HAS SEEN
PATIENTS DEVELOP EATING DISORDERS A FEW MONTHS AFTER USING THESE DRUGS. >> THEIR OBSESSION WITH FOOD
BECAME MORE OBSESSIVE. THE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER WEIGHT AND BODY BECAME OBSESSIVE. YOU START TO TURN INTO SOMEONE THAT IS NOT LIKE YOURSELF. >> WHEN TAKING THESE WEIGHT
LOSS DRUGS IT IS NORMAL TO HAVE LESS OF AN APPETITE, THAT LEADS YOU TO EAT LESS AND ULTIMATELY LEADS TO WEIGHT LOSS.
SOMETIMES IT CAN GO TOO FAR. >> HOW DO YOU KNOW A PATIENT EATING LESS IS NORMAL OR IF IT
CROSSES THE LINE INTO AN EATING DISORDER? >> THERE ARE A COUPLE SIGNS.
IF YOU'RE UNABLE TO EAT ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION. THE OTHER SYMPTOMS THAT WE SEE,
WE SEE PREOCCUPATION WITH THE NUMBER ON THE SCALE OF THE PROGRESS I AM MAKING. IT DOESN'T STOP. >> Reporter: MAJOR EATING
DISORDER ORGANIZATIONS ARE CALLING DOCTORS TO SCREEN PEOPLE FOR CONDITIONS LIKE ANOREXIA AND BULIMIA. IN THE STATEMENT, WEGOVY MAKER
SAID THE MEDICATION SHOULD ONLY BE TAKEN AS PRESCRIBED AND
TRUST HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ARE EVALUATING PATIENT'S INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. ELI LILLY SAID THEY ACTIVELY
ENGAGE IN MONITORING, EVALUATING AND REPORTING SAFETY INFORMATION GREAT IF SOMEONE IS
EXPRESSING SIDE EFFECTS, THEY ENCOURAGE THEM TO SPEAK WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. CYNTHIA IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE PSYCHOLOGIST WHO HAS HELPED
HER GET BACK TO A HEALTHY DIET AND WEIGHT. SHE IS STILL TAKING THE JUGS AND MAINTAINS HER WEIGHT BUT
DOES NOT USE IT AS OFTEN. >> I WISH I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PREPARED FOR THE SIDE
EFFECTS MY MENTAL HEALTH HAD. I APPRECIATE THE MEDICATION HELPED ME REACH MY WEIGHT LOSS GOALS.
>> DR. HILDEBRANDT SAID PART OF THE PROBLEM IS A LACK OF EDUCATION AND SCREENING BY DOCTORS TO FIND THOSE WHO MIGHT BE AT RISK FOR AN EATING

OR WATCH OR LISTEN TO THEM ALL, OUR TEAMS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. THIS IS WHAT IS GOING DOWN IN
THE REGION, AND A SEGMENT WE CALL THE LOCAL.
OUT OF THE SOUTHERN BOROUGH, POLICE SAY A 25-YEAR-OLD MAN IS FACING MULTIPLE CHARGES AFTER FOUR PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN A HOUSE FIRE. POLICE SAY HE LIVED ON THE
PROPERTY AND ADMITTED TO STARTING THE FIRE. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY. >>> AT OUR WESTBOROUGH, A HISTORIC POWER PLANT IN OHIO
COLLAPSED TODAY AFTER A CONTROLLED IMPLOSION. ROADS WERE CLOSED, PEOPLE WERE
TOLD TO STAY INSIDE. YOU CAN SEE THE SPARK AND SMOKES COMING FROM THE BUILDING. THERE IT IS, THE BIG CLOUD OF
DUST. OFFICIALS SAY THE ARIZONA SAFE. >> ALSO, A PARENT REUNITING
WITH ITS OWNER IN MICHIGAN AFTER 24 HOURS ON THE LOOSE. HOT FRESH PARROT NEWS WITH LEO
WHO ESCAPED HIS HOME SETTLING IN SOME TREES IN NORTHERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY. A ARBORIST CAME TO THE RESCUE
OFFERING LEO THE MOST TEMPTING SNACK POSSIBLE, A PBJ. THE BIRD ATE HALF OF IT, BUT
THE GUY ON THE HAND AND TOOK OFF SAYING WHO'S A GOOD BOY THIS IS REAL. A FEW HOURS LATER LEO WAS
SPOTTED AGAIN AND HE WAS BROUGHT DOWN SAFELY.
>>> TAKE YOU TO PARIS. TEAM USA SWIMMING SUPERSTAR KATIE LEDECKY MAKING HISTORY
WITH HER WIN IN THE 1500 SETTING A NEW OLYMPIC RECORD. SHE CRUSHED, SHE DOMINATED.
IF YOU FEEL LIKE I DON'T SEE SWIMMERS AROUND HER, THAT IS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO FAR BACK.
SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS SWIMMING BY HERSELF AT SOME POINTS.
THIS IS HER EIGHTH GOLD, TYING A RECORD FOR U.S. WOMEN. IN THE WATER AS WELL, THE
TRIATHLON, TRIATHLETES FINALLY SWIMMING AFTER THE WATER WAS DECLARED SAFE. GUESS WHO IS LIVE IN PARIS BRETT WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE OUR
BOY KIER SIMMONS. THERE'S A LOT OF TALK A SWIMMING.
KATIE LEDECKY IS AMAZING. AT 27 YEARS OLD, VERY YOUNG FOR HUMANS, ON THE OLDER END
OLYMPIC SWIMMERS AND SHE IS KILLING IT. >> Reporter: ON THE OLDER END.
>> THAT'S JUST NOT ME, I SAID SHE IS YOUNG FOR HUMANS. >> Reporter: ARE WE STARTING THIS RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE?
27. YES, 27, YOU ARE RIGHT, THAT IS
OLDER FOR AN OLYMPIAN. ALSO, BY THE WAY, JUST TRY SWIMMING ONE LAP OF A POOL --
>> NO THANKS. >> >> Reporter: -- FREESTYLE.
I TELL YOU, THAT WAS 15 MINUTES. IT IS LUNG CRUSHING. IT IS MUSCLE DEPLETING, IT IS
UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE HER. I THOUGHT AT ONE STAGE THAT KATIE LEDECKY WOULD START LAPPING THE
OTHER COMPETITORS SHE WAS SO FAR AHEAD THAT IT WAS RIDICULOUS.
AN AMAZING MOMENT FOR HER. I THINK WE HAVE A GRAPHIC. SHE IS CLOSE TO BEING THE MOST
METALS MEDS FOR TEAM USA
WOMEN. I THINK WE HAVE THAT GRAPHIC, THAT IS QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT.
SHE IS 27, BUT -- SIMONE BILES AND THE WOMEN GYMNAST CALL
THEMSELVES THE GOLDEN GIRLS, YOU ARE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT TO
MAKE THE REFERENCE IN TERMS OF HOW AMAZING IT IS AT THIS POINT IN THEIR CAREERS. THEY CALL THEMSELVES SOMETHING ELSE AS WELL BUT WE CANNOT SAY
IT. >> WE CAN. WE ARE TALK ABOUT THE USA WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS TEAM THEY
SAID THEIR OTHER TEAM NAME WAS F AROUND AND FIND OUT. I DID NOT SAY WHAT THE F STANDS
FOR UNTIL SIMONE BILES CAME OUT AND SAID IT'S GOLDEN GIRLS.
>> Reporter: I AM NOT SAYING IT. >> ON THE THAT'S LIKE
>> >> Reporter: THAT IS UP ON TWITTER AND THEN I GET A CALL. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SEINE
RIVER, WHICH YOU TOOK A DIP IN. IT IS FINALLY OPENING BACK UP. WE SAW TRAFFIC SWIMMING IN A.
DID YOU GET ANY VIBES THAT THEY WERE NERVOUS? THIS IS PAR FOR THE COURSE FOR THESE ATHLETES WHO DO SWIM IN
OPEN WATER, THAT IS PART OF THE COMPETITION.
>> Reporter: EXACTLY. I THINK THEY SAW ME SWIM AND FELT EMBARRASSED. OVERNIGHT THEY TESTED THE WATE
, THE BACTERIA, DESPITE THUNDERSTORMS HERE OVERNIGHT TOO, DESPITE THAT, THE WATER
LEVEL, THE BACTERIA LEVEL WAS LOW ENOUGH AND THERE THEY ARE SWIMMING, SWIMMING UNDER THE ALEXANDER III RIDGE AND LOOKING
EXHAUSTED AT MOMENTS. WHAT AN AMAZING PLACE, WHAT A
HISTORIC PLACE. YOU LOOK BACK AT THE BLACK AND WHITE PICTURES OF OLYMPICS
PASS, THOSE PICTURES WE WILL LOOK AT IN 100 YEARS AND SAY, LOOK AT THAT. I'M SO GLAD IT HAPPENED THAT WAY.
GOLD MEDAL FOR PARIS. THEY HAVE SPENT $1.5 BILLION,
THEY HAVE INVESTED A LITTLE BIT. >> YOUR DAILY QUESTION OF THE EVENING. WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE MOMENT
TODAY ASK WHAT IS THE THING YOU DID THAT YOU LOVED THE MOST? WHAT IS YOUR ROSE?
>> Reporter: YOU PREPARED ME YESTERDAY AND I CANNOT PREPARE FOR THIS. >> IT HAS BEEN 24 HOURS. >> Reporter: I KNOW.
I THINK KATIE LEDECKY. HONESTLY, I REALLY DO.
WE DID SEE SOUTH SUDAN AND BASKETBALL AGAINST TEAM USA AND THEY DID LOSE. IT IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE TO SEE
A GROUP OF REFUGEES, NONE OF WHOM LIVE IN THE COUNTRY GO TOE TO TOE WITH TEAM USA AND
BASKETBALL, LeBRON JAMES, HOW ABOUT THAT? >> THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT MOMENT.
I'M JUST TELLING YOU NOW KIER SIMMONS WE WILL TALK EVERY DAY AND I WILL ASK YOU THAT
QUESTION. KIER SIMMONS, I APPRECIATE YOU. YOU ARE MY ROSE OF THE DAY. >>> LET'S GO TO CHINA. SOME OF
THE OLYMPIC SWIMMERS THERE COMPETING FOR THAT COUNTRY SAY THEY ARE NOT THRILLED WITH HOW THEY ARE BEING TREATED. THEY SAY THEY ARE TESTED MORE
THAN THE OTHER ATHLETES ALL STEMMING FROM A DOPING CONTROVERSY GOING BACK TO THE GAMES FROM 2020 THAT WERE
PLAYED IN 2021. 23 CHINESE SWIMMERS TESTED POSITIVE.
ONE OF THOSE SWIMMERS COMPETING IN THE 200 METER FLIGHT TODAY COMING IN FIRST PLACE IN HER HEAT. THIS WHOLE THING IS REALLY
ADDING TO SOME OF THE TENSION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA. YOU HAVE A GROUP OF U.S. LAWMAKERS VARIOUS OVER HOW THAT
2021 CASE WAS HANDLED. SO MAD THEY INTRODUCED A BILL THAT COULD CUT FUNDING FOR THE
GLOBAL SPORTS AS A DOPING PROGRAM UNLESS THERE ARE CHANGES. THEY SAY THEY ARE CAUGHT IN THE
MIDDLE BETWEEN SUPERPOWERS. THIS IS WHAT IS SO INTERESTING
ABOUT THE LIMITS IT IS FUN, IT IS THE SAME INCREDIBLE COMPETITION SHOWCASING THE
WORLD'S GREATEST ATHLETES, BUT THERE ARE ALSO GEOPOLITICAL DYNAMICS AT PLAY, AND WE ARE
SEEING THAT HERE WITH THE CHINESE DOPING SCANDAL. TALK US THROUGH IT.
>> Reporter: YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. THIS CLOUD OF SUSPICION OVER CHINESE SWIMMERS IS THE DOPING SCANDAL OF THIS GAMES. IT IS
EXPOSING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CHRONIC LACK OF FAITH THAT MANY
U.S. ATHLETES HAVE IN A SYSTEM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO ENSURE
CLEAN AND FAIR COMPETITION. THEN YOU HAVE CHINESE SWIMMERS WHO ARE SAYING, THEY ARE BEING UNFAIRLY TREATED, THAT THEY ARE
BEING PSYCHOLOGICALLY IMPACTED. CHINESE SWIMMERS ARE BEING BYPASSED IN CONGRATULATIONS DURING MEDAL CEREMONIES BY
OTHER ATHLETES AND IT'S DISRUPTING THE SPIRIT OF THE GAMES. THEY ARE BEING TESTED MORE THAN OTHER ATHLETES.
WORLD AQUATICS OFFICIALS CONFIRM THAT ON AVERAGE, SINCE THE FIRST OF JANUARY, CHINESE SWIMMERS HAVE BEEN TESTED 21 TIMES BY VARIOUS ANTIDUMPING
ORGANIZATIONS. YOU COMPARE THAT WITH AMERICAN SWIMMERS AT SIX TIMES ON
AVERAGE AND AUSTRALIAN SWIMMERS AT FOUR TIMES. YOU ALSO HAVE U.S. ANTI-DOPING
AUTHORITIES AND U.S. ATHLETES LIVID ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. MICHAEL PHELPS TESTIFIED
RECENTLY TO A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE. HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. >> I THINK, IF WE CONTINUE TO
LET THIS SLIDE ANY FARTHER, THE OLYMPIC GAMES MIGHT NOT EVEN BE THERE. >> Reporter: THEN YOU HAVE
ALLISON SMIT, WHO WAS ALSO TESTIFYING TO THAT COMMITTEE. SHE WAS ONE OF THE SWIMMERS WHO
LOST OUT ON GOLD IN TOKYO TO SOME OF THE CHINESE SWIMMERS WHO ARE NOW CAUGHT UP IN THE
SCANDAL. >> WHAT ABOUT ANY RESPONSE FROM CHINESE LEADERS AND OLYMPIC OFFICIALS? YOU KNOW IT IS REALLY ENROLLING
THIS COMMUNITY. >> Reporter: WE SUBMITTED QUESTIONS TO CHINA'S MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TOLD THIS
QUOTE, CHINESE SWIMMERS ARE CLEAN AND HAVE NEVER FEARED TESTING. THEY ALSO SAY THE ALLEGATION QUOTE SMEARS AND ATTACKS CHINA AND ANTI-DOPING INSTITUTIONS
AND INTERFERES WITH THE GLOBAL ANTI-DOPING GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. CHINA STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS. THIS IS OLIVER SOCIAL MEDIA.
PEOPLE SAYING THAT CHINESE ATHLETES JUST ARE NOT PERFORMING AS WELL AT THIS OLYMPIC GAMES BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE PRESSURE. THEY ARE USING
COMMAS LIKE BEING TARGETED, DISCRIMINATION, IT IS PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL TORMENT.
>> GLAD TO HAVE YOU THERE COVERING THIS. I AM SURE WE WILL TALK AGAIN. >> COMING UP, STUNNING NEW
CLAIMS ABOUT THE WAY ISRAEL IS TREATING PALESTINIANS IN THE CUSTODY. WHAT ONE FORMER DETAINEE IS
7 TONIGHT, A REPORT FROM THE UN MAKING NEW CLAIMS ABOUT THE WAY ISRAEL TREATS ITS PALESTINIAN DETAINEES. THIS REPORT FROM THE UN HUMAN
RIGHTS OFFICE BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH FORMER DETAINEES DESCRIBES ALLEGATIONS OF SEVERE
TORTURE, INC. ELUDING REPORTS ARE BEING HELD IN CASE LIKE SILICAS, WATERBOARDING, SLEEP, FOOD AND
WATER DEPRIVATION, ELECTRIC SHOCKS, SETTING DOGS ON PRISONERS AND STRIPPED NAKED AND OTHER TREATMENT. THE ISRAELI MILITARY RESPONDED SAYING THE ABUSE OF DETAINEES IS ILLEGAL AND AGAINST MILITARY
ORDERS AND INVESTIGATIONS ARE LAUNCHED INTO ALL DETAINEE
DEATHS IN CUSTODY. >> IN A NEW NBCNEWS EXCLUSIVE, A FORMER PALESTINIAN DETAINEE IS DETAILING THEIR ACCOUNT IN
LINE WITH THE UN FINDINGS. WE WANT TO WARN YOU, SOME OF
WHAT YOU WILL HEAR IS DISTURBING. >> Reporter: ON JULY 9th, HE WALKED OUT OF AN ISRAELI
PRESENT A BROKEN MAN. EFFECT, HE COULD BARELY WALK AT ALL. HIS LEGS SHATTERED, HIS RIGHT
ARM FRACTURED. HE WAS CONFUSED AND EMACIATED. ONCE A FIT 200 POUND AMATEUR
BODYBUILDER, THE 39-YEAR-OLD FATHER OF FIVE TELLS US HE WAS RELENTLESSLY TORTURED IN PRISON.
>> THEY STRIPPED ME AND BEGAN TO BEAT ME WHILE I WAS NAKED HE TOLD ME IN AN EXCLUSIVE
INTERVIEW FROM HIS HOME IN BETHLEHEM IN THE WEST BANK. THEY EVEN HIT ME ON THE GENITAL
ORGANS HE SAID. >> AND THE PEOPLE WITH YOU AS WELL I ASKED? >> YES. THEY USED TO BEAT ALL
THE PRISONERS. WHEN THEY HANDCUFFED US THEY WOULD MAKE US IT ON THE GROUND
LIKE ANIMALS. >> Reporter: ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE SERVICES DID NOT RESPOND TO OUR REQUEST TO RESPOND.
>> Reporter: IT IS THIS TYPE OF ALLEGED ABUSE BY GUARDS AT ANOTHER PRISON THAT LED FAR
RIGHT ISRAELI PROTESTERS TO BREAK INTO THE DETENTION CAMP ON MONDAY. NOT TO PROTEST SUSPECTED
PRISONER ABUSE, BUT TO TRY TO STOP THE ISRAELI POLICE FROM ARRESTING AND QUESTIONING NINE
GUARDS SUSPECTED OF TORTURING DETAINEES. THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL FAR RIGHT COMPANIES OF
THE ISRAELI PARLIAMENT SCREAMING DEATH TO TERRORIST.
SINCE THE OCTOBER 7th ATTACKS, NBCNEWS HAS INTERVIEWED FORMER DETAINEES BOTH IN GAZA AND THE WEST BANK WHO GIVE LARGELY
SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF SEVERE MISTREATMENT IN DETENTION. LIKE THIS GROUP OF PRISONERS RELEASED JULY 25th.
SOME UNABLE TO WALK. OTHERS SUFFERING FROM AMNESIA AND BROKEN BONES ACCORDING TO
THE RELATIVES. THE IDF TOLD NBCNEWS THEY TREAT DETAINEES ACCORDING TO
INTERNATIONAL LAW. HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS LIKE HRW DISPUTE THAT. THEY SAY THE
ARREST AND ABUSE HAS INCREASED SINCE OCTOBER 7. >> UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL TRINITY AND LAW THE RED CROSS
HAS THE MAIN MANDATE TO MONITOR DETENTION FACILITIES AND THERE HAS BEEN NO VISITS. THERE IS COMPLETE ISOLATION AND NO AWARENESS TO WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN THESE DETENTION CONDITIONS, EXCEPT WHEN
WHISTLEBLOWERS SPEAK TO JOURNALIST, SPEAK TO MEDIA AND ARE ABLE TO GIVE US A SENSE OF
WHAT IS GOING ON. >> Reporter: HE TOLD US ISRAELI FORCES CALLED HIM A KILLER,
SOMETHING HE DENIES. HE SAID HE WAS INTERROGATED ONCE IN NINE MONTHS. NO CHARGES WERE EVER FILED.
>> Reporter: HE WAS HELD UNDER SO-CALLED ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION.
PALESTINIAN PRISONERS CAN BE DETAINED WITHOUT CHARGE AND WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM.
>> YOUR FAMILY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT YOUR WHEREABOUTS AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO YOU, I ASKED? >> NO. I WAS ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD
HE RESPONDED. IT IS THE WORST TORTURE PRISON KNOWN IN HISTORY.
WEED THE PRISONERS NAME DID GUANTANAMO. HIS FIFTH CHILD, A SON, WAS
BORN WHAT HE WAS HELD IN CAPTIVITY. HE SAYS HE NOW CARRIES A PRISON WITHIN HIM AND EVEN THOUGH HE
IS HOME, HE IS NOT ENTIRELY FREE.
SCENT WHEN WE COME BACK, IT IS R MARS, IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE ON
THE CUSP OF SOMETHING BIG. >>> STUB HUB TONIGHT AT THE
CENTER OF A NEW LAWSUIT THAT ACCUSES THE COMPANY OF DECEPTIVE PRICING AND HIDDEN
FEES. YOU KNOW STUB HUB, YOU HAVE PROBABLY USED THEM TO BUY
CONCERT TICKETS OR SPORTS TICKETS OR MAYBE YOU SOLD
TICKETS. THIS LAWSUIT FILED BY THE D.C. ATTORNEY GENERAL ACCUSES THE COMPANY OF SOMETHING CALLED DRIP PRICING, MEETING POSTING A PRICE THAT IS NOT COMPLETE,
ADDING A BUNCH OF FEES DURING THE LONG CHECKOUT PROCESS, USING A COUNTDOWN CLOCK TO MAKE IT FEEL URGENT. ULTIMATELY, THEY SAY, BOOSTING
PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF CUSTOMERS. TO THE TUNE OF SOMETHING $118 MILLION IN HIDDEN FEES IS 2015
ACCORDING TO THE LAWSUIT. IN A STATEMENT STUB HUB
RESPONDED SAYING THEY ARE COMMITTED TO CREATING A TRANSPARENT, SECURE, AND COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE TO BENEFIT CONSUMERS. ADDING THEIR USER EXPENSES CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW AND
COMPETITORS PRACTICES. DANNY CEVALLES JOINS US NOW. THE LAW LAYS OUT THIS EXAMPLE, TWO TICKETS LISTED AT $178
EACH. OF THE TIME THE PERSON GETS THE SCREEN THEY PAY THEY ARE HIT WITH $141 IN FEES THAT BOOST THE TICKET PRICE, OBVIOUSLY BY
QUITE A BIT. WHAT DOES THE LAWSUIT SAY ABOUT STUB HUB, THE ACCUSATION GOES,
TRICKS CUSTOMERS INTO PAYING THIS. >> Reporter: THEY INTRODUCE IT
AS DRIP PRICING, BUT IT USES THE TERM WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH, THE BAIT AND SWITCH.
THEY PUT THOSE TWO WORDS IN BOLD. EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THAT PRACTICE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT'S THE AG PLAINTIFFS ARE ALLEGING THAT
STUB HUB DOES A BAIT AND SWITCH. THEY ADVERTISE ONE PRICE, BY
THE TIME YOU GET TO THE END AND ASSIGNED TO BY YOU ARE NOW AT ANOTHER PRICE. THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WHAT NOT ONLY D.C. HAS BUT MANY
STATES HAVE WHICH IS, VERY BROADLY DRAFTED CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS. SOME OF THESE BROADLY PROHIBIT
ANY UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE. THAT IS A VERY BIG. A CREATIVE
ATTORNEY GENERAL OR PRIVATE
PLAINTIFF CAN BRING SUIT. IF THE THEORY FITS, THE COMPANY MIGHT BE ON THE HOOK UNDER THESE VERY PERMISSIVE STATUTES.
>> THIS IS THE LATEST IN THE STRING OF LAWSUITS AGAINST TICKET COMPANIES AND THIS IS
NOT THE FIRST LAWSUIT FOR STUB HUB THIS YEAR. >> Reporter: YES. SOME OF THESE COPIES HAVE BEEN SUED FOR
ANTITRUST. THAT IS DIFFERENT, THAT IS ABOUT MONOPOLISTIC PRACTICES. THAT IS ABOUT CARTEL TYPE BEHAVIOR, CREATING
>>> TERRIFYING PICTURES OF A WILDFIRE IN COLORADO NOW
TURNING DEADLY.
YOU CAN SEE THE LINE OF FIRE HERE IN A HEAT WAVE MAKING THINGS WORSE FOR FIREFIGHTERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE YOU LIVE
WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING AS WE SPEAK . >> THE COMBATIVE AND CONTROVERSIAL APPEARANCE BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT A CONFERENCE FOR BLACK JOURNALISTS QUESTIONING KAMALA HARRIS HIS OWN RACIAL IDENTITY. WE ARE LIVE WITH BOTH CANDIDATES ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TONIGHT.
>>>
PLOTTING THE TERROR ATTACKS NOW AGREED TO PLEAD GUILTY. WE HAVE OUR PENTAGON CORRESPONDED TO EXPLAIN HOW WE GOT HERE NEARLY 23 YEARS LATER. >>> THE NO WARNING AFTER THE
KILLING OF A HAMAS LEADER IN ITS CAPITAL. THE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS FROM HERE. >>> THE MARATHON TRIAL OF YOUNG THUG TAKING A NEW AND WHILE
TWIST . MORE ON THE ACCUSATIONS OF ANOTHER SECRET MEETING THAT HAS THE DEFENSE CALLING FOR A MISTRIAL. >>> WE ARE GOING TO START WITH BREAKING NEWS.
THE PENTAGON ANNOUNCING THAT THREE MEN ACCUSED OF PLOTTING THE TERROR ATTACK IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE REACHED PLEA
AGREEMENTS IN THE MILITARY COMMISSIONS PROCESS. I WANT TO BRING AN HOUR PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT COVERING THIS FOR US. WHAT DO WE KNOW AND WHAT HAS
HAPPENED? >> THE MEN ACCUSED OF PLOTTING THE 9/11 ATTACKS. MAYBE NOT NAMES REVIEWERS WOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH. HE IS ONE OF
THE CASES THAT GOT A LOT MORE ATTENTION IN THE DAYS AFTER. YOU CAN SEE HIS PICTURE ON THE
SCREEN. ALL THREE MEN HAVE BEEN HELD
OVER 20 YEARS AND DURING A LARGE PORTION OF THE TIME FOR YEARS NOW THEIR ATTORNEYS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE MILITARY COMMISSION PROCESS TO TRY TO
COME TO SOME SORT OF A PLEA AGREEMENT THAT WHAT WE JUST LEARNED MOMENTS AGO IS THEY HAVE REACHED THAT. THIS IS THE MILITARY COMMISSIONS PROCESS.
IT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN A NORMAL OR REGULAR COURT AS I KNOW IT. BASICALLY THEIR
ATTORNEYS INDEPENDENCE THEMSELVES WITH SIT DOWN WITH WHAT IS CALLED A CONVENING AUTHORITY.
SORT OF LIKE A COURT ADMINISTRATOR. SOME OF THE POWERS OF THE JUDGE. THROUGH MANY MONTHS THEY HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THESE POSSIBLE PLEAS AND HAVE COME TO ONE.
WE DO NOT KNOW THE DETAILS THOUGH. GENERALLY BECAUSE ALL THREE MEN WERE CHARGED WITH CRIMES THAT WOULD COME WITH THE DEATH PENALTY GENERALLY IN A PLEA
AGREEMENT LIKE THIS THEY WOULD COME TO SOME SORT OF A DEAL TO PLEAD GUILTY TO CHARGES THAT WOULD BE JUST LESS THAN THAT
WOULD YIELD LESS THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH PENALTY. THAT IS WHAT WE BELIEVE HAPPENED HERE. ALL THREE ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN
COURT AT GUANTA■AMO BAY AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK, BUT WE DON'T EXPECT ANY SENTENCING TO BE UNTIL SOMETIME NEXT YEAR, SO WE STILL WON'T KNOW FOR SOME
TIME EXACTLY WHAT THIS MEANS AS THE NEXT STEPS
>> WHAT IS THE TIMELINE LOOKING LIKE FROM HERE? AND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS FAIRLY EXTENDED AT THIS POINT. >> IT IS. THIS IS SOMEWHAT COMMON IN THE
MILITARY COMMISSIONS PROCESS WHERE YOU HAVE THIS LAG TIME BETWEEN WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL
PLEADS GUILTY AND THEY ARE ACTUALLY SENTENCED. SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE EVEN LONGER THAN A YEAR FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.>>> WE ALSO HAVE MORE TO
FOLLOW OUT WEST WHERE THE ODDS SEEM TO BE STACKED AGAINST
RESCUERS TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON WHAT HAS NOW BECOME A DEADLY WILDFIRE IN COLORADO. WITH RESOURCES READ THIN
HUNDREDS FORCED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES IN THE DARK. MULTIPLE HOUSES NOW DESTROYED. OFFICIALS IS SOUNDING THE ALARM ABOUT WHAT IS NEXT. >> EVERYTHING IS STACKED UP
AGAINST US. WE HAVE VERY FLAMMABLE FUEL.
WE HAVE SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESS ON IT.
>> THERE IS ANOTHER NEW FIRE IN CALIFORNIA THREATENING HUNDREDS OF BUILDINGS. TWO ENTIRE COUNTIES EVACUATED.
THE HEAT WAVE IS MAKING THAT MASSIVE PARK FIRE ALREADY ONE OF THE BIGGEST IN STATE HISTORY EVEN HARDER TO FIGHT. WITH OFFICIAL DESCRIBING YOUR
RECORD LEVELS OF DRYNESS FUELING THESE FIRES. STEVE PATTERSON IS OUT THERE AND JOINING US NOW.
TALK US THROUGH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN COLORADO WHERE THE FIRE HAS TURNED DEADLY. ONE OF THEM. AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA WHERE IT
IS AN EXTENDED STRETCH OF FIGHTING. I THINK I CAN HEAR CHAINSAWS BEHIND YOU. >> Reporter: YOU CAN. THEY ARE CHOPPING DOWN TREES IN
A FOREST THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY GUTTED. EVERY WOODED
AREA IN THIS AREA LOOKS LIKE IT HAS BEEN TURNED TO ASH, AND
THERE IS DESTRUCTION ALL AROUND ME. THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW PARTS OF THE NINE MASSIVE PARK FIRE. IT
MAY GET EVEN LARGER BY THE TIME THIS IS ALL SAID AND DONE. THE FIRE HAS BEEN BURNING FOR A WEEK STRAIGHT. FIREFIGHTERS ARE'S BREAD THEN.
AT LEAST 89 MAJOR FIRES. THOSE ARE JUST THE BIG ONES BURNING ACROSS THE AMERICAN
WEST. SENDING SMOKE ALL THE WAY TO THE AMERICAN EAST. AND COLORADO
IT IS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS BECAUSE SEVERAL FIRES HAVE JUST POPPED UP. A FEW OF THEM OVERNIGHT. THERE IS A NETWORK OF FIRES ABOUT EIGHT MILES APART OR SO
BETWEEN THE BORDERS. THEY HAVE TURNED DEADLY, AND OTHER RESOURCES ARE THE PROBLEM
BECAUSE IT IS RENTING OUT NOT
ONLY THE ENTIRE STATE, BUT 600 FIREFIGHTERS FROM COLORADO AND OTHER STATES TRYING TO HELP OTHER AGENCIES, SO THIS IS A PROBLEM ACROSS THE WEST THAT'S
ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE IF THE HOT WEATHER HITS US AS EXPECTED.>>> FORMER PRESIDENT
DONALD TRUMP GETTING COMBATIVE ON STAGE TODAY AT A CONFERENCE FOR BLACK JOURNALISTS. FROM THE
JUMP AND GOT REALLY TESTY AND CONTENTIOUS WITH HIM AT ONE POINT ATTACKING VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS'S RACIAL
IDENTITY. TAKE A LISTEN. >> SHE WAS ALWAYS OF INDIAN HERITAGE AND ONLY PROMOTING INDIAN HERITAGE. I DID NOT KNOW SHE WAS BLACK UNTIL A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND
SHE HAPPENED TO TURN BLACK, AND NOW SHE WANTS TO BE KNOWN AS BLACK. IS SHE INDIAN OR BLACK? >> HE IS ROLLING IN PENNSYLVANIA RIGHT NOW OR ABOUT
TWO AT LEAST AS THEY DEFEND WHAT HE SAID AT THAT PANEL. THOSE CLOSE TO HIM DESCRIBING HIS INTERVIEW AS A DISASTER PATIENT IS GETTING READY TO
SPEAK IN TEXAS LESS THAN AN HOUR FROM NOW. HER CAMPAIGN IS FOCUSED ON NEXT WEEK'S REAL DEAL TICKET KICKOFF WHEN SHE IS EXPECTED TO
ANNOUNCE A RUNNING MAY AND THEN HIT UP SOME BATTLEGROUNDS. THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL SHE BE TRAVELING WITH? THAT MYSTERIOUS SHADOW WILL BE FILLED IN BY ONE OF THESE FACES
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, AND A BUNCH OF THEM ARE SUGGESTING THEY ARE DOWN FOR THE COMPETITION. THE HAVE THE NEW VIDEOS OUT IN THE LAST 18 HOURS.
THEIR BIOS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS. ON THE HEELS OF A BIG
ENDORSEMENT FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT. LET'S START WITH PENNSYLVANIA WITH MR. TRUMP WHO SAW THE CROWD DOING THE WAY BEHIND YOU.
HE IS GETTING A LOT OF BACKLASH. PRESUMABLY ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, BUT OTHER AREAS FROM THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM AS HE HAS
DUG IN ON HIS ONLINE ACCOUNTS ABOUT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS'S RACIAL IDENTITY. >> THIS IS NOT THE MESSAGE THAT
HE WAS HOPING TO CONVEY AT THAT CONFERENCE TODAY BUT WE KNOW HE HAS BEEN TARGETING A SMALL SUBSET OF BLACK VOTERS IN THE
COUNTRY.
WHERE HE THINKS HE CAN DO BETTER FROM 2020. HE WANTED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND TRYING TO APPEAL ON VOTERS THAT WAY.
WE WANT TO PLAY THE MESSAGE I THINK THEY HOPED AND THEN TALK ABOUT THE RESPONSE TO THE ONE HE ULTIMATELY DID DELIVER.
HERE IS WHAT THEY HAD HOPED WOULD BE THE BIG TAKE AWAY FROM TONIGHT. >> COMING FROM THE BORDER ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT HAPPEN TO BE TAKING BLACK
JOBS. >> WHAT EXACTLY IS A BLACK JOB? >> ANYBODY THAT HAS A JOB IS WHAT IT IS
>> AS QUESTIONABLE AND POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC AS THE PHRASE BLACK JOB IS THAT IS THE ECONOMIC MESSAGE THAT HE THOUGHT WOULD BE HELPFUL. WHAT WASN'T HELPFUL WAS HIS
IDENTITY POLITICS.
I DO NOT THINK A SINGLE REPUBLICAN THINK IT IS A GOOD STRATEGY AND MANY THEY THINK IT IS A TERRIBLE STRATEGY THEY HAVE TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES
FROM'S. LARRY HOGAN. THIS IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER CLEANUP FOR TRUMP APPEARED
DEFENDING THE COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
AND HERE ON STAGE AS WELL. >> WE WILL SEE ABOUT WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO SEE THE VICE PRESIDENT IS SPEAKING SHORTLY.
IS THE EXPECTATION SHE MAY ADDRESS THIS MOMENT? >> FROM TALKING TO THE AID THEY DO EXPECT THAT SHE WILL, AND IT
PLAYS RIGHT INTO THE KIND OF CAMPAIGN RHETORIC WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM HER AS OF LATE WHERE SHE HAS SAID IF YOU WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ME SAY IT TO MY FACE WITH AN INVITATION FOR A DEBATE, BUT HER CAMPAIGN IS ALREADY RESPONDING WITH A STATEMENT
THAT GOES AFTER THE TONE AND LANGUAGE AND THE STYLE THAT DONALD TRUMP DISPLAYED SAYING IT IS REALLY A PART OF THE TIRADE OF CHAOS THAT VOTERS ARE
ACCUSTOMED TO. SIMPLY A TASTE OF THE CHAOS AND DIVISION THAT HAS BEEN THE HALLMARK OF TRUMP'S RALLIES AND
ALSO EXACTLY WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SEE FROM ACROSS THE DEBATE STAGE AS VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS OFFERS A VISION OF OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM FOR
ALL AMERICANS. THEY ARE GETTING TOGETHER A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS THEY WANT TO DEBATE AND REMIND VOTERS THAT CHAOS COMES WITH DONALD
TRUMP, AND THAT IT WOULD BE
WHAT YOU WOULD GET AGAIN IF VOTERS RETURNED HIM TO THE WHITE HOUSE. EXPECT THEM TO TRY TO MAKE USE OF WHAT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD
TRUMP SAID IN THE WAY THAT HE SAID IT IN THE WORDS HE CHOSE AND THE EMPHASIS HE PLACED AS THEY GO FORWARD IN THE
CAMPAIGN. >> LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT VICE PRESIDENT SWEEPSTAKES. I WILL GO WITH J.D. VANCE WHO HAS HAD A PRETTY
ROCKY START TO HIS TIME AS A REPUBLICANVICE PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINEE. THERE HAVE BEEN CRITICISMS OF HIS 2021 COMMENTS ON CHILDLESS CAT LADIES. HE HAS HAD TO DEFEND THE REPEAT OF THE. OUR TEAM SPOKE WITH HIS FELLOW
SENATORS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE AISLE ABOUT THIS. LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID. NOTE TRUMP CRITIC TYPICALLY ABOUT THIS MOMENT. WATCH.>> A SIMPLE ANSWER, BUT
ALSO HE SIMPLY SAID NO, BUT A TELLING ONE. TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW YOU SEE THAT FITTING INTO THE BIGGER PICTURE.
>> HE WAS TRYING TO DO THE POPULIST ECONOMIC TAKE ON CURRENT CONSERVATISM. TRYING TO PUT INTELLECTUAL
FRAMEWORK AROUND THE MOVEMENT, SO THAT RESPONSE FROM HIM IS CERTAINLY NOTABLE. NOT A LOT YOU COULD REALLY ASK
AVP TO DO EXCEPT FOR NOT BE A DISTRACTION FOR THE TICKET.
THAT IS STILL HIS MOST IMPORTANT JOB IS TO MAKE SURE
THEY TURN OUT FOR DONALD TRUMP THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS HOPEFUL
IT WILL GET WORK THROUGH THE MEDIA SYSTEM AND THE STORYLINE WILL MOVE ON.
HE IS HAVING TO EXPLAIN WHAT J.D. VANCE MEANT IN HIS OWN INTERVIEWS. THAT IS A NEGATIVE AND NOT THE
KIND OF GROUND THEY HOPE TO BE FIGHTING THE NEXT 97 DAYS OR SO.
>> I'M GOING TO LET YOU SOAK IN THE PRE-SPEECH SOUNDTRACK. YOUR TURN ON THE WHOLE VICE PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THOSE VIDEOS AND
THIS CRITICAL ENDORSEMENT THAT
THEIR TICKET IS GETTING FROM THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS. A KEY UNION IECE OF THE COALITION THE DEMOCRATS ARE HOPING TO BUILD. TALK US THERE WHERE THINGS
STAND AT THE MOMENT BUT WE KNOW THERE IS AN END THAT WILL PRESUMABLY BE ON TUESDAY. SIX DAYS FROM NOW.>> THAT IS BECAUSE THE CAMPAIGN IS
PREVIEWING VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS AND HER CHOICE FOR A RUNNING THEY WILL BE TOGETHER ON TUESDAY IN PHILADELPHIA AND THEN HAVE SEVERAL CAMPAIGN EVENTS
TOGETHER IN KEY BATTLEGROUND PLACES. ALL OF THE STATES THAT REALLY MATTER. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT, SO THAT GIVES US A HARD END FOR
THE SEARCH. WE EXPECT THAT SHE WILL USE THE DAYS BETWEEN NOW AND THEN TO FINALIZE AND REFINE HER SELECTION. WE ALREADY KNOW WHO SOME OF THE
KEY NAMES ARE AND THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH A VETTING PROCESS. THAT DOES INCLUDE THINGS LIKE
LOOKING AT COMMENTS THAT THEY HAVE MADE.
J.D. VANCE'S COMMENTS FROM TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO IS DURING THE TIME THAT JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS HAD BEEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, SO IT IS NOT LIKE
REACHING BACK 20 YEARS. THEY WILL LOOK FOR THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT GOVERNORS OR CENTERED R. KELLY THEY HAVE
BEEN THROUGH SOME ELECTIONS, AND THAT CAN PRODUCE SOME OF THE VETTING THAT TAKES PLACE. IT DOES POP TO A DIFFERENT LEVEL WHEN YOU'RE TALKING
NATIONAL POLITICS. YOU CAN WIN STATEWIDE AND NOT HAVE THE LEVEL OF SCRUTINY OVER YOUR FINANCES OR PERSONAL LIFE AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE EVER SAID LIKE YOU DO AT THE
NATIONAL LEVEL. SOME OF THAT IS CERTAINLY BEING POURED OVER NOW TO TRY TO REFINE THE CHOICES TO GIVE HER A PICK THAT SHE CAN FEEL
COMFORTABLE ABOUT WITHOUT SURPRISES, BUT WE WILL SEE HOW THAT GOES.>> GLAD TO HAVE YOU.
>>> A NEW WARNING FROM IRAN'S
SUPREME LEADER. PLEDGING TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF HAMAS'S TOP POLITICAL OFFICIAL. BLAMING ISRAEL FOR THE ATTACK THAT KILLED THAT OFFICIAL.
ONE OF THEIR MOST SENIOR LEADERS. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ADDRESSED
THE WORLD TODAY BY MAKING NO
MENTION OF THE THING THAT THE WORLD IS TALKING ABOUT. NOT SAY WHETHER THEY HAD ANY ROLE IN THE ASSASSINATION. THE TO TAKE CREDIT FOR ANOTHER
ONE HOURS EARLIER THAT THEY SAY KILLED A TOP HEZBOLLAH COMMANDER. WITH ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS IN
BOTH THE TAX RAISING CONCERNS YET AGAIN ABOUT WIDENING CONFLICT IN A REGION. WE HEARD FROM BENJAMIN
NETANYAHU. HE DID NOT MENTION THE KILLING IN THIS ADDRESS.
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO READ INTO REGARDING THAT OMISSION AND WHAT DID HE SAY? >> HE DID AND MENTIONED THAT
ATTACK, AND THEY ARE NOT CONFIRMING OR DENYING IT. IN
THE PAST THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TARGETED STRIKES. BACK IN THE DAY THEY USED TO
WITH SOME REGULARITY HAVE THESE AND NUCLEAR SCIENTISTS.
ACTIVISTS AGAINST THE ISRAELI'S. THEY WOULD STRIKE IN SYRIA AND
POWERPLANT AND OTHER FACILITIES AND NOT CONFIRM OR DENY IT.
WHY DID THEY CONFIRM AND ANNOUNCE THEY HAD HIT HEZBOLLAH HERE WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW JUST YESTERDAY? THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THEY HAD MORE OF A
CONSTITUENCY TO ANSWER TO AND AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE. TALKING ABOUT THE ATTACK ON THE SOCCER FIELD OVER THE WEEKEND THAT KILLED 12 CHILDREN AND
TEENAGERS. I DO NOT HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU.
WHEN IT COMES TO STRIKES WITHIN IRAN THEY TYPICALLY DO NOT DO THAT.
IN HIS SPEECH HE WENT THROUGH A LONG LIST OF ALL OF THE TARGETS THEY HAD BEEN STRIKING AND EACH ONE OF THOSE OUR IRAN BACK
GROUPS. WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THEIR PERSISTENCE THEY HAVE BEEN ACTING IN CONCERT. NOW
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SEEMS TO BE ATTACKING THEM IN SUCCESSION
ONE AFTER ANOTHER, AND THAT REALLY IS VERY THREATENING BECAUSE IT MAKES IT SEEM AS THOUGH THIS WHOLE THING IS
GOING TO COME TO A HEAD WITH A FIGHT BETWEEN IRAN AND ISRAEL.
>> AND THAT IS THE THING THAT THE WORLD FEARS. MORE POLITICAL THAN MILITARY AND INVOLVED IN NEGOTIATIONS FOR POTENTIAL CEASE-FIRE, SO WHERE DOES THAT STAND?
>> I AM SURE THEY THINK THE
NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN KNEECAP BY THIS MOVE. THE FACT IS HE WAS A MAIN
DIPLOMAT WHEN IT CAME TO HAMAS AND ITS DEALINGS ABROAD.
HE IS AN OUTWARD LOOKING HAMAS FIGURE.
WITHOUT HIM HE WAS CONSIDERED SOMETHING OF A MODERATE BY HAMAS STANDARDS.
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU COMPARE HIM TO SOME OF THE OFFICIALS THERE RIGHT NOW. THIS REALLY DOES PUT THE NEGOTIATIONS BACK, BUT THEY
WERE ALL BUT DEAD ANYWAY. >> GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US TONIGHT. >>> ECONOMIC NEWS TONIGHT.
DROPPING SOME TEA LEAVES THAT AN INTEREST RATE CUT COULD BE ON THE TABLE AS SOON AS SEPTEMBER BUT FOR ANOTHER KEEPING RATES STEADY AS THEY
WERE TO REIN IN INFLATION. MARKETS SEEMS TO LIKE IT.
WHAT IS WITH THIS DECISION AND IS IN THE GOOD NEWS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LOWER MORTGAGE RATE? >> THIS IS MY FAVORITE BECAUSE THE STORY IS THAT NOTHING
HAPPENED. >> IT IS UP WHAT IS UNDER THE STORY. >> EXACTLY. THIS IS THE BEST HARD.
HOW IS IT THAT CUT THEY WERE EXPECTING COULD LIKELY HAPPEN.
IT HAS BEEN ENCOURAGED BY INFLATION READINGS.
WITH INFLATION HING COME DOWN TO ABOUT 2.5% ON ONE MEASURE
THE FED HAS BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THAT NUMBER.
THAT IS IT NEAR MULTI-DECADE HIGHS. THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO CUT
INTEREST RATES AS SOON
>> THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE FALL OF VACATED PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN YEAR. HE SAID TODAY HE KNOWS THAT IS A PART OF THE OVERLAY.
>> WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS THERE IS ALWAYS THE CALENDAR THAT MIGHT NOT WORK.
I WOULD BE RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION. WHAT THEY HAVE SAID IS WE CANNOT ANSWER TO CONGRESS OR
THE PRESIDENT. ARE DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE WE ARE STEERING THE ECONOMY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HE DID ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF
INDEPENDENCE. TAKE A LISTEN.>> WE DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN OUR APPROACH.
WE NEVER USE OUR TOOLS FOR ANY
POLITICAL OUTCOME. >> A SHORT TRANSLATION. IT IS BECAUSE THE ECONOMY NEEDS IT
>>> OPEN WITH NEWS TODAY NAMING
A NEW CEO. ON THE OTHER HAND ANNOUNCING RECORD LOSSES. YOU HAVE THE INDUSTRY VETERAN WHO IS SAID TO REPLACE THE
OUTGOING CEO NEXT WEEK. WITH OPEN HOPING TO STOP THE BLEEDING AFTER REPORTING A LOSS OF NEARLY 1.5 BILLION IN THE
SECOND QUARTER. STEPPING DOWN AFTER A NOT SO GREAT YEAR SO FAR STARTING IN JANUARY.
THE STARLINER SPACESHIP IS STILL DOCKED AT THE SPACE STATION WITH ITS ASTRONAUTS UNABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR AFTER
ENGINE PROBLEMS. >> THE NEW CEO. IS THIS GOING TO TURN THEIR FORTUNES AROUND? >> THE HAS A TOUGH JOB. EVERY SINGLE UNIT HAS STRUGGLED.
COMMERCIAL AIRLINES.
STILL DOCKED TO THE SPACE STATION. DO NOT SAY IT IS STUCK. IN AN EMERGENCY THEY COULD RETURN HOME. YOU HAVE BEEN THERE SIX WEEKS
AND CAN'T GET HOME. REALLY?
YOU CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT, BUT THEY CAN'T GET UT OF THERE RIGHT NOW. WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THEM TO GIVE US A TIMELINE FOR AND
THEN THEY COULD RETURN. OPENING IS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER BUDGET ON THAT DIVISION. AND THEN MILITARY ALSO
STRUGGLING WITH IN BOWLING. TROUBLE ACROSS THE BOARD TO THE NEW CEO HAS A VERY BIG JOB.
>> WAS FIRST ON THE LIST? >> THE IS MOVING THE HEADQUARTERS BACK TO SEATTLE FROM RIGHT ACROSS THE RIVER.
THEY MOVED THE HEADQUARTERS A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO CATER TO THE MILITARY. BY DOING THAT THE ARGUMENT IS THEY TOOK THE EYE OFF THE BALL,
AND IT IS COMMERCIAL AIRLINES. THAT IS THE BREAD AND BUTTER. ENGINEERING THEY LOST FOCUS ON SO THE ARGUMENT GOES.
HE IS A VETERAN AEROSPACE ENGINEER. 35 YEARS IN THE BUSINESS.
HE IS BRINGING ALL OF THE HEADQUARTERS OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT BACK TO SEATTLE.
HE IS 64 YEARS OLD. THEY HAVE A MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE OF 65. THE BOARD IS WAIVING THAT. WE NEED THIS GUY.
HE COMES FROM THERE, AND WE
WILL WAIVE THAT MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE. THAT WILL BE THE CHALLENGE. HE HAS TO DO A LOT OF WORK AND REGAIN THE CONFIDENCE OF
AIRLINES, WHICH ARE THE REAL CUSTOMERS. >> CAN GO BACK TO THE SPACE STATION SITUATION? I THOUGHT THEY WERE THERE IN COULD GET BACK IF THEY WANTED
TO BUT ARE GIVING THEMSELVES MORE TIME TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIX THIS ENGINE THRUSTER ISSUE WHILE THEY ARE OF THERE? IS THAT STILL THE THINKING?
>> IT IS. SIX OR SEVEN WEEKS AGO THEY SAID
DON'T CALL THEM STUCK BECAUSE IN AN EMERGENCY THEY COULD COME HOME AND PROBABLY BE COMING HOME IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE
FOR NINE OR 10 DAYS. THEY HAVE BEEN THERE 50+ DAYS AND WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THEM TO DO A FULL THOROUGH
ANALYSIS BEFORE THEY SAY IT IS SAFE TO COME BACK IN THE SPACESHIP. AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU HAVE TO SAY IF THEY ARE NOT STUCK WHAT
ARE YOU CALLING IT HERE? A DELAY TO STAY WITH A ROOM WITH A VIEW BUT WE ARE NOT
STUCK. AT A CERTAIN POINT THEY HAVE TO GET IT BACK SAFELY
>> STILL WEARING OTHER PEOPLE'S UNDERWEAR. >> THANK YOU. WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO
OTHER NEWS AS WELL TONIGHT >>> COMING UP NEXT
>>> IN GEORGE'S LONGEST-RUNNING CRIMINAL TRIAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS FOR YOUNG THUG'S SAY THEY HAVE LEARNED OF YET ANOTHER SECRET MEETING BETWEEN THE FORMER JUDGE AND PROSECUTORS IN THE CASE AFTER
DRAMATIC SCENES IN COURT WEEKS AGO AND THE DEFENSE FOUND OUT ABOUT A DIFFERENT SECRET MEETING THE FIRST TIME AROUND. YOU ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF
THOSE MOMENTS THAT WENT VIRAL WHEN HE WAS ORDERED TO SPEND WEEKENDS IN JAIL FOR CONTEMPT. THAT JUDGE ENDED UP REMOVED ALTOGETHER, BUT NOW THEY WANT A
MISTRIAL CALLING IT A REVERENTLY TAINTED. YOUNG THUG IS FACING CHARGES HE LED AN ATLANTA-BASED CRIMINAL GANG AND OVERSAW CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER, ARMED ROBBERY,
AND DEAL DRUGS. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES BASED ON
REPORTING THE DEFENSE GETS THE MISTRIAL IT WANTS AFTER
REVEALING WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS THIS SECRET MEETING BETWEEN A JUDGE WHO USED TO OVERSEE THE CASE AND PROSECUTORS? >> THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT
LEGAL OBSERVERS WHO HAVE BEEN CAPTIVATED BY THIS CASE ARE DEBATING RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR IS THAT THE JUDGE
WHO HAS TAKEN THE ROLE IN THIS CASE HAS DENIED ALL THE EMOTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD SO FAR THAT SHE HAS GOTTEN A CHANCE TO SEE ANY SORT
OF MISTRIAL. THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE THE MOST MEAT TO IT BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO INDICATE A PATTERN THAT THE JUDGE WAS HAVING THE SECRET
MEETINGS WITH PROSECUTORS AND OTHER DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARE BRINGING UP THE FIRST TIME THE SECRET MEETING THAT WAS CONDUCTED ON JUNE 10 WAS BROUGHT UP WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
AT LENGTH. I WAS NEVER BROUGHT UP IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS THAT THERE THERE WAS NOW ONE OF THE SECRET MEETING THAT HAPPENED ON JUNE 7? ESSENTIALLY THEY ARE TRYING
TO SAY RIGHT NOW IS THAT EVERYTHING THE JUDGE RULED ON AND ALL THE DECISIONS HE MADE
PRIOR TO HIM BEING RECUSED FROM THE CASE SHOULD BE CALLED INTO QUESTION AND NOT JUST THAT. WHEN THE FIRST SECRET MEETING WAS REVEALED BY THE DEFENSE
ATTORNEY THAT THE CASE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN PUT ON PAUSE AT THAT POINT AND THAT THE JUDGE ACTUALLY DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT AND REFER THE OF THE JUDGE TO
COME IN AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS GOING TO BE RECUSED, BUT HE CONTINUED TO ALLOW THE JURY TO LISTEN TO WITNESS TESTIMONY FOR DAYS, SO NOW THEY
ARE SAYING THAT IS TAINTED TESTIMONY. THERE IS A REALLY HIGH BAR WHEN IT COMES TO A JUDGE DECLARING A MISTRIAL, BUT THIS IS BEEN
ABSOLUTELY AN UNPRECEDENTED CASE, SO ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. >> DID THE INSTALLATION OF THE SLOWDOWN THE TRIAL MORE?
WHAT IS THE TIMELINE AS THIS
WAS ALREADY THERE LONGEST- RUNNING CRIMINAL TRIAL? >> I THINK THAT IS ANOTHER QUESTION THAT EVERYBODY IS WATCHING. SHE SEEMED TO INDICATE SO FAR
WHEN IT HAS PICKED BACK UP THAT SHE WANTS TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY. SHE SAYS THAT SHE IS HOPING IT WON'T TAKE ANOTHER SEVEN MONTHS, BUT SHE IS PREPARED IF
IT DOES. THE PROSECUTORS HAD ANOTHER 105 WITNESSES THEY WANT TO CALL TO THE STAND, BUT THE JUDGE HAS MOVED RATHER SWIFTIE MAKING BIG DECISIONS.
ONE WAS TO NOT ALLOW YOUNG THUG
TO ACTUALLY BOND OUT OF JAIL. HIS DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WERE TRYING TO ARGUE HAS BEEN BEHIND BARS SINCE MAY 2022 AND A LOT
OF THE DELAYS AND PAUSES HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. HE IS NOT A FLIGHT RISK OR A RISK TO THE COMMUNITY, BUT THE
JUDGE ACTUALLY DENIED THAT REQUEST. SHE ALSO DENIED THE
PROSECUTION'S REQUEST TO PUT A GAG ORDER ON THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND NOT ALLOW THEM TO SPEAK PUBLICLY OR TO THE MEDIA ABOUT THIS CASE, SO IF YOU LOOK
AT THOSE DECISIONS EVERYONE IS HOPING THAT PERHAPS THIS CASE
COULD BE WRAPPED UP KIND OF QUICKLY, BUT IT HAS ALREADY SET RECORDS FOR BEING THE LONGEST TRIAL IN GEORGE'S HISTORY.>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.>>>
RESCUERS IN INDIA SEARCHING FOR PEOPLE AFTER THOSE LANDSLIDES WE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT HAVE
KILLED MORE THAN 150 ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS. LOOK AT ALL OF THAT MOTHER.
THAT RAIN YOU SEE FALLING IS MAKING IT HARDER. OVER 5500 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RESCUED SO FAR. >>> TWO FORMER STUDENTS PLEADING GUILTY TO MISDEMEANOR
HAZING AND AFTER A PLEDGE AT THEIR FRATERNITY DIED. THEY APPARENTLY DRANK, FELL,
AND I. THEIR LAWYERS DO NOT MERELY RESPOND TO REQUEST FOR COMMENT. >>> FOUR PEOPLE HURT AFTER AN
EXPLOSION AT A LAUNDROMAT IN FLORIDA. THAT IS THE PARKING LOT COVERED IN SHATTERED GLASS. THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING WAS ALSO DAMAGED.
THAT BORIS HAD RECALL IS NOW EXPANDING TO INCLUDE 7 MILLION MORE POUNDS OF DELI MEAT AND OTHER FOOD OVER CONCERNS ABOUT
LISTERIA. YOU CAN SEE SOME OF WHAT HAS BEEN RECALLED ON THE SCREEN. OVER 30 PEOPLE CROSS SEVERAL STATES HAVE GOTTEN SICK ACCORDING TO HEALTH OFFICIALS.
>>> AND I SPOKE RIGHT IN FLORIDA TAKING A TURN FOR THE WORSE WHEN A WOMAN REALIZED HER DOG WAS NOT ON BOARD. THERE SHE IS.
THE CAPTAIN OF A TOUR BUS SPOTTED HER AND AFTER A DAY SHE WAS REUNITED WITH HER OWNER. THAT IS AMAZING TO SEE
>>> WITH IN-DEPTH REPORTING ON A TOPIC WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING PEOPLE'S POPULAR WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS WE HAVE BEEN COVERING.
STUDIES AND SHOWING THESE REVOLUTIONARY MEDICATIONS CAN HAVE DRAMATIC BENEFITS, BUT DOCTORS ARE ALSO REPORTING SOME PATIENTS DEVELOPING EATING DISORDERS OR SEEING THEM GET WORSE WHEN USING THE DRUGS
>> SHE HAS ALWAYS HAD A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH FOOD. FIGHTING OBESITY SINCE SHE WAS A KID. EVENTUALLY DIAGNOSED WITH BINGE
EATING DISORDER. >> FOR ME IT WAS OBSESSING ABOUT MY NEXT MEAL IN MY NEXT
SNACK. I WAS ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT FOOD IT. IT JUST CONTINUOUS THOUGHTS ABOUT IT.
>> HER DOCTOR RECOMMENDED A DRUG AS A PART OF A NEW CLASS OF MEDICATIONS USED FOR WEIGHT LOSS
>> SHE ADMITTED SHE USES A WEIGHT-LOSS MEDICATION. >> WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SHOCKED HER. >> COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY I
THINK ABOUT FOOD.
FOR THE BINGE EATING IT ALMOST COMPLETELY TOOK IT AWAY. >> SHE BEGAN EATING AS LITTLE AS 500 CALORIES PER DAY. >> I DID EXPERIENCE MY BLOOD
SUGAR LEVELS DROP BECAUSE I WASN'T EATING ENOUGH OR FREQUENTLY ENOUGH. OF THE FIRST TIME I FAINTED I WAS ON THE SUBWAY. IT BECAME MORE IMPORTANT TO
MAINTAIN THAT WEIGHT LOSS AND TO CONTINUE LOSING WEIGHT OVER FIELDING MY BODY. >> THEY SAY SHE WAS A PART OF AN EMERGING TREND OF PATIENTS.
>> THE CHIEF OF THE PROGRAM
SAYS HE HAS SEEN PATIENTS DEVELOP EATING DISORDERS A FEW MONTHS AFTER STARTING THE DRUGS. >> THE RELATIONSHIP WITH FOOD BECAME MORE OBSESSIVE.
YOU START TO TURN INTO SOMEONE NOT LIKE YOURSELF. >> AND TAKING THE DRUGS IT IS
NORMAL TO HAVE LESS OF AN APPETITE THAT THIS LEADS THEM TO EAT LESS AND ULTIMATELY LEADS TO WEIGHT LOSS, BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN GO TOO FAR.
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW IF EATING LESS IS A PART OF A REACTION OR CROSSES A LINE INTO AN EATING
DISORDER?>> THE OTHER KIND OF
SYMPTOMS WE SEE IS A PREOCCUPATION WITH THE PROGRESS I AM MAKING.>> THEY SAY THEY
ARE NOW CALLING FOR DOCTORS TO SCREEN PEOPLE FOR CONDITIONS LIKE ANOREXIA OR BULIMIA BEFORE PRESCRIBING THESE DRUGS.
IN A STATEMENT THEY SAY THE MEDICATIONS SHOULD ONLY BE TAKEN AS PRESCRIBED AND TRUST
THAT THEY ARE EVALUATING A PATIENT'S INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. TO
ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN MONITORING AND REPORTING SAFETY INFORMATION AND IF SOMEBODY IS EXPERIENCING ANY SIDE EFFECTS
THEY ENCOURAGE THEM TO SPEAK WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. SHE IS NOW WORKING CLOSELY WITH A PSYCHOLOGIST THAT HAS HELPED HER GET BACK TO A HEALTHY
WEIGHT
>> I WISH I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER PREPARED FOR THE SIDE EFFECTS THAT MY MENTAL HEALTH HAD, BUT I APPRECIATED THE MEDICATION HELPING ME REACH MY
GOALS.
>> A PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE LACK OF EDUCATION AND SCREENING BY DOCTORS TO FIND THOSE WHO MIGHT BE AT RISK OF AN EATING
DISORDER. FOR THOSE LOOKING TO START THEM AND WORRIED YOU MIGHT BE AT RISK OF A RECOMMEND YOU TALK TO
A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL.>>> STILL TO COME. A LOT MORE INCLUDING BEYOND THE
METALS AND WORLD RECORDS. WE WILL TALK ABOUT
>>> RECOVER HUNDREDS OF INTERNATIONAL STORIES EVERY DAY, AND BECAUSE IT CAN BE TOUGH TO LISTEN TO THEM ALL OUR TEAMS HAVE DONE IT FOR YOU. YOUR IS AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY
ARE WATCHING. FIREFIGHTERS BATTLING HUGE WILDFIRES FOR THE THIRD DAY IN A ROPE. AT LEAST ONE PERSON HAS DIED BUT DOZENS OF HOMES ARE DONE.
AND THOUGHT OF WIND IS CREATING TOUGH CONDITIONS FOR THIS THING TO BE PUT OUT. 66 WILDFIRES HAVE ERUPTED ALONE OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS
>>> A BIG FUEL SHORTAGE TONIGHT IN BOLIVIA. LOOK AT THESE ROWS OF CARS WAITING FOR GAS. THEY IMPORT ABOUT HALF THE GASOLINE. THIS WAS MOSTLY CAUSED AFTER
THIS SHIPMENT OF DIESEL SUPPLIES DID NOT COME THROUGH. TRANSPORT UNIONS PROTESTING THE
SHORTAGES. >>> A COUPLE OF PANDAS LOOKING LIKE THEY ARE GETTING IN ON ALL OF THE FUN SHOWING OFF THEIR GYMNASTIC SKILLS. SOME STRENGTH ON THE RINGS.
ALL OF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO HELP THEM ENHANCE THEIR BEHAVIOR AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THAT IS GOOD STUFF.
TAKING YOU TO PARIS NOW.
THE SWIMMING SUPERSTAR MAKING HISTORY WITH HER WIN. SETTING A NEW OLYMPIC RECORD. SHE DOMINATED . HERE SHE IS.
IF YOU DO NOT SEE SWIMMERS IN THE OTHER LINES AROUND HER THAT IS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO FAR BACK HERE SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE
WAS SWIMMING BY HERSELF AT SOME POINTS. THIS IS HER EIGHTH GOLD MEDAL.
>> THESE TRIATHLETES FINALLY SWIMMING AFTER THE WATER WAS DECLARED SAFE YOUR GUESS WHO IS LIVE IN PARIS FOR US. THERE IS A LOT OF SWIMMING TALK
TONIGHT. NOT YOURS, BUT SHE IS AMAZING. WHAT IS INTERESTING IS EVEN AT
27 YEARS ON VERY YOUNG FOR HUMANS ON THE ORDER END FOR
OLYMPIC SWIMMERS. SHE IS KILLING IT. >> THAT IS NOT ME.
I SAID SHE WAS YOUNG >> WE ARE STARTING LIKE THIS RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.
27 IS ORDER FOR AN OLYMPIAN. ALSO JUST TRY SWIMMING ONE LAP
OF A POOL FREESTYLE. 15 MINUTES.
IT IS LIKE IT IS A LONG CRUSHING. MUSCLED THE PLEADING.
IT IS UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE HER. I THOUGHT AT ONE STAGE SHE MIGHT START MAPPING THE OTHER COMPETITORS. SHE WAS SO FAR AHEAD IT WAS
RIDICULOUS. AN AMAZING MOMENT FOR HER. I THINK WE HAVE A GRAPHIC. THAT SHE IS CLOSE TO HAVING THE
MOST METALS AGAINST TEAM USA
WOMEN. I THINK WE HAVE THAT GRAPHIC. THAT IS GOING TO BE QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT.
SHE IS 27, BUT SHE IS REALLY JUST GETTING STARTED. SIMONE BILES AND THE WOMEN GYMNASTS CALL THEMSELVES THE GOLDEN GIRLS, SEE YOU ARE RIGHT
TO MAKE THE REFERENCE IN TERMS OF HOW AMAZING IT IS AT THIS POINT IN THEIR CAREERS
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
THIS A BUNCH. LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE RIVER. IT IS FINALLY OPENING BACK UP AS OF TODAY. YOU ACTUALLY SAW THEM SWIMMING IN A. DID YOU GET ANY VIBES THAT THEY WERE NERVOUS ABOUT IT
OR WAS THIS PAR 4 COURSE FOR THEM?>> I THINK THEY SAW ME SWIMMING AND FELT KIND OF EMBARRASSED. OVERNIGHT THEY
TESTED THE WATER. DESPITE THE THUNDERSTORMS
OVERNIGHT. DESPITE THAT THE BACTERIA
LEVELS WERE LOW ENOUGH, AND THERE THEY ARE SWIMMING. SWIMMING UNDER THE ALEXANDER THE THIRD BRIDGE, AND LOOKING EXHAUSTING AT MOMENTS THERE.
WHAT A HISTORIC PLACE. YOU LOOK BACK AT THOSE PICTURES
OF OLYMPICS PAST. WE WILL LOOK AT THOSE IN 100 YEARS TIME AND SAY HOW ABOUT THAT? SO GLAD THAT HAPPENED THAT WAY. AND A GOLD MEDAL FOR PARIS.
WHICH HAS SPEND BILLIONS, SO THEY HAVE INVESTED A LITTLE BI
. >> YOUR DAILY QUESTION OF THE EVENING. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MOMENT TODAY? WHAT IS YOUR ROSE?
>> YOU PREPARED ME YESTERDAY AND I DIDN'T PREPARE FOR THIS.
I THINK KATIE HONESTLY. WE DID
SEE SOUTH SUDAN AND BASKETBALL
AGAINST TEAM USA, AND THEY DID LOSE, BUT IT IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE TO SEE THEM GOING
TOE TO TOE WITH THE TEAM USA AND BASKETBALL. LeBRON JAMES AND HOW ABOUT THAT? >> THAT WAS ANOTHER GREAT MOMENT. WE ARE GOING TO TALK EVERY DAY,
AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU THAT QUESTION.
APPRECIATE YOU. THANK YOU. >>> SOME OF THE OLYMPIC SWIMMERS IN CHINA COMPETING FOR THAT COUNTRY. THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT THRILLED WITH HOW THEY HAVE BEEN
TREATED. THEY SAY THEY'RE GETTING TESTED MORE THAN ANY OTHER ATHLETES STEMMING FROM THIS DOPING CONTROVERSY GOING BACK TO THE GAMES FROM 2020 THAT WERE
PLAYED IN 2021. THREE CHINESE SWIMMERS TESTED POSITIVE FOR ONE OF THEM YOU CAN SEE THERE COMPETING IN THE
200 METER FLIGHT TODAY COMING IN FIRST PLACE, BUT THIS WHOLE
THING IS REALLY ADDING TO SOME OF THE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA. THIS GROUP OF LIGHT MAKERS FEARS OVER HOW THAT CASE WAS
HANDLED SO MAD THEY INTRODUCED
A BILL THAT COULD CUT UNDING FOR THE GLOBAL SPORTS ANTI DOPING SYSTEM UNLESS THERE ARE SOME CHANGES. WORLD ANTI-DOPING OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE BEING UNFAIRLY CAUGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT THEY DESCRIBE AS GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS BETWEEN SUPERPOWERS. WE ARE JOINED NOW FROM BEIJING. THIS IS A PART OF WHAT IS SO
INTERESTING ABOUT THE OLYMPICS IS IT IS FUN AND INCREDIBLE
COMPETITION SHOWCASING THE WORLD'S GREATEST ATHLETES, BUT ALSO A GEOPOLITICAL DYNAMICS AT PLAY, AND WE ARE SEEING THAT WITH THIS DOPING SCANDAL. TALK US THROUGH IT.>> YOU ARE
EXACTLY RIGHT. THIS CLOUD OF SUSPICION OVER CHINESE SWIMMERS IS THE DOPING SCANDAL BECAUSE IT IS EXPOSING
WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CHRONIC LACK OF FAITH THAT MANY U.S.
ATHLETES HAVE IN A SYSTEM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO ENSURE CLEAN AND
FAIR COMPETITION. AND THEN YOU HAVE CHINESE SWIMMERS WHO ARE SAYING THEY
ARE BEING UNFAIRLY TREATED IN PSYCHOLOGICALLY IMPACTED. THAT CHINESE SUMMERS ARE BEING BYPASSED IN THE CONGRATULATIONS DURING METAL CEREMONIES BY OTHER ATHLETES.
THAT IS IS DISRUPTING THE GAMES. THEY ARE BEING TESTED MORE THAN OTHER ATHLETES. WERE THE QANTAS OFFICIALS CONFIRM THAT ON AVERAGE SINCE 1 JANUARY CHINESE SWIMMERS HAVE
BEEN TESTED 21 TIMES BY VARIOUS ANTI-DOPING ORGANIZATIONS. YOU COMPARE THAT WITH AMERICAN SWIMMERS AND SIX TIMES ON
AVERAGE AND AUSTRALIAN SWIMMERS AT 4 TIMES A, BUT YOU ALSO HAVE U.S. ANTI-DOPING AUTHORITIES AND U.S. ATHLETES LIVID ABOUT
WHAT IS HAPPENING. MICHAEL PHELPS TESTIFIED RECENTLY TO A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE AND HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY
>> I THINK IF WE CONTINUE TO LET THIS SLIDE ANY FURTHER THE OLYMPIC GAMES MIGHT NOT EVEN BE THERE.>> AND THEN YOU HAVE
ALLISON SCHMIDT WHO WAS ALSO TESTIFYING TO THE COMMITTEE. SHE WAS ONE OF THE SWIMMERS WHO LOST OUT ON A GOLDEN OKYO TO SOME OF THE CHINESE SWIMMERS
WHO WERE NOW CAUGHT UP IN THE SCANDAL. >> WHAT ABOUT A RESPONSE FROM
CHINESE LEADERS ON THIS AND OLYMPIC OFFICIALS ON THIS? BECAUSE IT IS REALLY SWIRLING AROUND THE COMMUNITY.
>> WE SUBMITTED SOME QUESTION TO CHINA'S MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND THEY TOLD US CHINESE SWIMMERS ARE CLEAN AND HAVE NEVER FEARED TESTING.
THEY ALSO SAID THE ALLEGATION
SMEARS AND ATTACKS IN CHINA AND INTERNATIONALLY ANTI-DOPING INSTITUTIONS AND INTERFERES WITH THE GLOBAL ANTI-DOPING GOVERNANCE SYSTEM. CHINA STRONGLY CONDEMNS THIS. IT IS ALL OVER CHINESE SOCIAL
MEDIA. THIS IS A HUGE TOPIC.
SAYING THAT THEY JUST AREN'T PERFORMING AS WELL AT THIS OLYMPIC GAMES BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE PRESSURE. USING COMMENTS LIKE BEING TARGETED. THAT IS DISCRIMINATION.
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL TORMENT. >> GLAD TO HAVE YOU COVERING
ALL OF THAT FOR US. >>> COMING UP.
STUNNING NEW CLAIMS ABOUT THE WAY IS
>>> A REPORT IS MAKING NEW CLAIMS ABOUT THE WAY ISRAEL TREATS ITS PALESTINIAN DETAINEES.
FROM THE UN'S HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICE BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH FORMER DETAINEE DESCRIBES ALLEGATIONS OF SEVERE TORTURE INCLUDING REPORTS OF BEING HELD IN CAGE LIKE FACILITIES AND
WATER BOARDED AND WATER DEPRIVATION. ELECTRIC SHOCKS. SENDING DOGS ON PRISONERS.
THE ISRAELI MILITARY RESPONDING SING ABUSIVE DETAINEES IS ILLEGAL AND AGAINST MILITARY ORDERS AND THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE LAUNCHED INTO ALL DETAINEE DEATHS IN CUSTODY. IN A NEW EXCLUSIVE A FORMER
PALESTINIAN DETAINEE IS DETAILING THEIR ACCOUNT IN LINE WITH THE UN'S FINDINGS.
WE WANT TO WARN YOU SOME OF WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR IS DISTURBING. >> ON JULY 9 HE WALKED OUT OF
PRISON A BROKEN MAN. HE COULD BARELY WALK AT ALL. HIS LEGS SHATTERED AND HIS RIGHT ARM FRACTURED.
ONCE A FIT 200 POUND BODYBUILDER
HE TELLS US HE WAS RELENTLESSLY TORTURED IN PRISON. THEY
STRIPPED ME AND BEGAN TO BEAT ME WHILE I WAS NAKED HE TOLD ME IN AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW FROM HIS HOME IN BETHLEHEM.
THEY EVEN HIT ME ON THE GENITAL ORGANS HE SAID, AND THE PEOPLE
AS WELL. THESE TO BEAT ALL OF THE PRISONERS AND THEY USED TO MAKE US SIT ON THE GROUND LIKE ANIMALS HE SAYS. ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE SERVICES
DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST TO RESPOND. IT IS THIS TYPE OF
ALLEGED ABUSE AT ANOTHER DESERT PRISON THAT LED FAR RIGHT ISRAELI PROTESTERS TO BREAK INTO THE DETENTION CAMP ON
MONDAY. NOT TO PROTEST SUSPECTED PRISONER USE BUT TO TRY TO STOP THE ISRAELI POLICE FROM ARRESTING AND QUESTIONING NINE GUARDS SUSPECTED OF TORTURING
DETAINEES THAT THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY SEVERAL FAR RIGHT MEMBERS OF THE ISRAELI PARTLY AMEND. SCREAMING DEATH TO TERRORISTS.
SINCE THE ATTACKS NBC NEWS HAS INTERVIEWED DETAINEES WHO GIVE
LARGELY SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF SEVERE MISTREATMENT IN
DETENTION LIKE THIS GROUP OF PRISONERS RELEASED JULY 25. SON UNABLE TO WALK AND OTHERS SUFFERING FROM AMNESIA AND BROKEN BONES ACCORDING TO THEIR
RELATIVES. THE IDF SAYS THEY TREAT DETAINEES ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL LAW. HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS DISPUTE THAT
AN ESSAY THE ARRESTS AND ABUSES HAVE INCREASED SINCE OCTOBER 7.>> UNDER HUMANITARIAN LAW
THEY HAVE THE MAIN MANDATE TO MONITOR DETENTION FACILITIES, AND THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NO VISITS, SO THERE IS COMPLETE ISOLATION AND NO AWARENESS TO
WHAT IS EXACTLY HAPPENING IN THESE CONDITIONS. EXCEPT WHEN THEY SPEAK TO MEDIA
AND ARE ABLE TO REALLY GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT IS GOING ON. >> ISRAELI FORCES CALLED HIM A KILLER. SOMETHING HE DENIES. HE SAID HE WAS INTERROGATED
ONLY ONCE IN NINE MONTHS. NO CHARGES WERE EVER FILED. HELD UNDER SO-CALLED ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION WHERE
PRISONERS CAN BE DETAINED WITHOUT CHARGE AND WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM. >> HER FAMILY DID NOT KNOW YOUR
WHEREABOUTS AT THE TIME.
>> I WAS ISOLATED FROM THE WORLD.
THE PRISON IS THE WORST TORTURE PRESENT KNOWN IN HISTORY. HIS FIFTH CHILD WAS BORN WHILE
HE WAS HELD IN CAP 70.
HE SAYS HE NOW CARRIES THE PRISON WITH IN HIM AND THAT EVEN THOUGH HE IS HOME HE IS NOT ENTIRELY FREE.
>>> AND NEW LAWSUIT ACCUSES STUB HUB OF HIDDEN FEES. YOU HAVE PROBABLY USED THEM TO BUY SPORTS TICKETS. MAYBE HAVE SOLD TICKETS ON THERE. THE LAWSUIT ACCUSES THEM OF
SOMETHING CALLED DRIP PRICING MEANING POSTING A PRICE THAT IS NOT COMPLETE. USING THAT LITTLE
COUNTDOWN CLOCK TO MAKE IT FEEL URGENT. THEY SAVE BOOSTING PROFITS AT
THE EXPENSE OF CUSTOMERS BY THE TUNE OF 118 MILLION SINCE 2015.
IN A STATEMENT THEY ARE RESPONDING SALAK COMMITTED TO CREATING A TRANSPARENT AND COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE TO BENEFIT CONSUMERS. ADDING THEIR USER EXPERIENCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW AND
WITH COMPETITORS PRACTICES. WE ARE SHOWING THIS EXAMPLE. BY THE TIME THE PERSON GETS TO
THE SCREEN WHERE THEY ACTUALLY PAY THEY ARE HIT WITH $140 IN
ACTUAL FEES. BOOSTING THE TICKET PRICE BY
QUITE A BIT. WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT TRICKING
CUSTOMERS INTO PAYING THIS STUFF? >> IT INTRODUCES US TO THE DRIP PRICING, BUT ALSO A TERM WE ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH. THE BAIT AND SWITCH.
THEY PUT THOSE WORDS IN BOLD. EVERYONE IS FAMILIAR WITH THAT PRACTICE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE
ALLEGING THAT STUB HUB DOES A
DATE AND SWITCH. BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE END AND IT IS TIME TO BUY YOU ARE NOW AT ANOTHER PRICE. THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
WHAT NOT ON THE D.C. IS BUT MANY STATES, WHICH IS VERY BROADLY DRAFTED CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS. SOME OF THEM BROADLY PROHIBIT ANY UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE TRADE
PRACTICE. THAT IS A VERY BIG TENT. CREATIVE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR PRIVATE PLAINTIFF CAN BRING
SUIT AND IF THE THEORY FITS THE COMPANY MIGHT BE ON THE HOOK
UNDER THESE VERY PERMISSIVE STATUTES. >> THIS IS THE LATEST STRING.
ARTIFICIAL DEMAND THAT DOESN'T EXIST BECAUSE OF MULTIPLE
MONOPOLISTIC PRACTICES. THIS IS DIFFERENT. THIS IS LIKE DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING WHERE THEY TELL US ONE PRICE AND GIVE US ANOTHER AT THE END.
