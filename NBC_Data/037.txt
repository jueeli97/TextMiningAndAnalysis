>> GOOD EVENING. WELCOME TO THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF TOP STORY LIVE FROM PARIS. YOU MAY HEAR SIRENS IN THE
DISTANCE BECAUSE THEY ARE OW OPENING ROADWAYS ALL OVER THE CITY. THE ROAD HAD SSENTIALLY BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR HE OPENING
CEREMONY. THE CITY ABUZZ, RIGHT? IT WAS THE KIND OF START TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES THE CITY IN THE
WORLD NEEDED, CEREMONY OF EPIC
PROPORTIONS SPANNING FOUR MILES, LINED WITH SPECTATORS, NOT LETTING ANYTHING RAIN ON THEIR PARADE. ORGANIZERS DELIVERING ON THEIR PROMISE THAT THIS WOULD BE THE START UNLIKE ANYTHING WE HAVE
SEEN IN THE GAMES HISTORY. YOU CAN SEE THEM RIGHT HERE, WAVING FLAGS AS THEY MADE THEIR WAY DOWN THE FAMED WATERWAY.
THEY HAD INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCES, LADY GAGA HEADLINING, SINGING IN FRENCH AT ONE POINT. SINGERS AND DANCERS KEEPING
FRANCE ALIVE, LEANING INTO ROMANTIC CLICHI■.
TIGHTROPE WALKERS AND ZIP LINERS SALIVATING FROM ABOVE, AND THE PYROTECHNIC SHOW LINING SOME OF THE MOST NOTABLE
LANDMARKS. LOOK AT THAT. FROM THE BALCONIES TO THE STANDS, EVERYONE WANTED A GLIMPSE OF THE JAW-DROPPING SPECTACLE. TEAM USA LED BY LeBRON JAMES
AND TENNISGRAND SLAM CHAMPION,
COCO GOLF, SCREAMING AND CHANTING. SOME OF THE MOST UNIQUE MOMENTS INCLUDING THE PASSING OF THE OLYMPIC TORCH, UNITING ATHLETES FROM AROUND THE GLOBE. THE TORCH MADE ITS FINAL STOP
LIGHTING THE OLYMPIC CAULDRON INSIDE OF A HOT AIR BALLOON. YES, YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT. THE BALLOON LIFTING OFF INTO THE NIGHT SKY, LITERALLY LIGHTING UP THE CITY OF LIGHT.
AND TO CLOSE OUT THE EVENING, CELINE DION SERENADING THE CITY FROM THE TOP OF THE EIFFEL TOWER, MORE ON HER INSPIRING PERFORMANCE LATER IN THIS
BROADCAST. THE OUTDOOR EVENT PUTTING IMMENSE PASSION ON SECURITY OPERATIONS, AND OPERATION THAT WAS QUICKLY TESTED AFTER A COURT NEEDED ARSON ATTACK
PARALYZED MUCH OF FRANCE'S HIGH
SPEED TRAIN LINES. YOU CAN SEE HOW EXPENSIVE THE SYSTEM IS. 800,000 PASSENGERS WERE IMPACTED AS FAR AS LONDON. THE LATEST ON THAT INVESTIGATION AND JUST A
MOMENT. RIGHT NOW, EXCITEMENT IS PULSING THROUGH THE CITY, VENUES FEATURING SCENIC BACKDROPS READY FOR COMPETITIONS
OFFICIALLY BEGINNING. STARTING IN JUST HOURS, WE WILL GET A GLIMPSE AT TEAM USA'S MOST NOTABLE ATHLETES IN ACTION. SIMONE BILES, KATIE LEDECKY, AND LeBRON JAMES ARE SOME OF
THE STARS GOING FOR GOLD THIS WEEKEND. WE ARE BRINGING YOU THE MOST INCREDIBLE MOMENTS AND, OF
COURSE, PREVIEW OF WHAT IS IN STORE. WE WANT TO START WITH KEIR SIMMONS WHO HAS BEEN COVERING THE OLYMPICS IN THE LEAD UP FOR
MONTHS NOW. YOU HAVE BEEN OUT THERE COVERING THIS. TELL US EVERYTHING THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. WE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST IME. TELL US WHAT SURPRISED YOU.
>> Reporter: IT WAS AMBITIOUS, UNPRECEDENTED, IT WASN'T ALWAYS
PERFECT. IT WAS POURING WITH RAIN HERE THROUGH MOST OF THE
EVENING. AND WE WORRIED ABOUT SO MANY THINGS, DIDN'T WE? WE WORRIED ABOUT SECURITY, WE
WORRIED ABOUT WHETHER THE EVENT WOULD BE READY. WE HAVE TO LAUGH NOW. WE WORRIED IF PARIS WOULD BE TOO HOT FOR THE OLYMPICS. INSTEAD, WE HAD THE RAIN,
SOMETHING NOBODY PREDICTED. AND YEAH, THE ATHLETES IN THE PERFORMANCE WERE WORKING
THROUGH IT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME, YOU HAD THIS INTERWEAVING OF THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCES, AND THE ATHLETES PARADE. REMEMBER IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS
THERE WAS SO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE ABOUT THE OPENING CEREMONY. IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS, WE HAVE SEEN THE PERFORMERS THAN THE ATHLETES. WITH THIS, THE BOATS WERE GOING
FOR MILES ALONG THE RIVER, IT MADE IT SO MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING. IT WAS SO FRENCH. ONLY THE FRENCH COULD DO THIS
WITH THE CONFIDENCE KNOWING THEY HAVE THE BEAUTIFUL EIFFEL TOWER SO THEY CAN FRANKLY PULL
ANYTHING OFF. I THINK THE GLOVE HAS BEEN LAID DOWN TO OTHER CITIES TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO COPY SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
BECAUSE, IT WAS LESS EXPENSIVE. IT WAS MORE SUSTAINABLE. IT WAS, FRANKLY, BRILLIANT. >> HERE, BESIDES THE EIFFEL
TOWER, RIGHT, THAT WAS INCREDIBLE, THE LIGHT SHOW THAT
IT HAD. IT WAS THE FINALE, RIGHT? THE CAULDRON AND THE HOT AIR BALLOON, REALLY, THE CITY OF
LIGHT LIGHTING UP QUITE LITERALLY OVER OUR HEADS.
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT, TOM. WE CAN SEE THE HOT AIR BALLOON LIGHTING UP THE PARIS SKY TO MY RIGHT. IF YOU KNOW PARIS, YOU KNOW
THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE WHERE THERE ARE HUGE BUILDINGS. EVERYWHERE ELSE IS ONE LEVEL.
IT REALLY DOES STAND OUT. YOU ARE RIGHT, THE PERFORMANCE BY CELINE DION, LOOK HOW CLOSE WE WERE THERE. SHE WAS ON THE EIFFEL TOWER,
RIGHT THERE. IT WAS, FRANKLY, INCREDIBLE. BY THE WAY, WE WERE THIS CLOSE AS TEAM USA CAME BY WITH LeBRON JAMES LEADING, HOLDING THAT
FLAG, THE AMERICAN FLAG, REALLY ASTONISHING. BEGINNING WITH LADY GAGA'S PERFORMANCE, YOU KNOW, THIS OPENING CEREMONY INTERLEAVED MODERN MUSIC AND CLASSICAL
MUSIC WITH WORLD MUSIC.
IT HAD CULTURAL REFERENCES. IT WAS HISTORY MAKING. IT ALSO REFERENCED HISTORY AGAIN AND AGAIN. AGAIN, ONLY THE FRENCH COULD DO THIS.
>> BEFORE YOU GO, TELL US, HOW WET DID IT GET?
YOU MENTIONED TEAM USA. WHEN THEY CAME OUT, THEY WERE SOAKING. >> Reporter: IT WAS WET. YEAH, IT WAS SO WET. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.
I MEAN, THE ATHLETES, YOU CAN SEE THEM AT TIMES BATTLING WITH THE WEATHER. TEAM USA WAS ON A BIG BOAT.
THERE WERE SOME COMING ALONG ON TINY BOATS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL. IT WAS BRAVE, WASN'T IT?
IT WAS AMBITIOUS. THEY WERE PREPARED TO TAKE RISKS, THE FRENCH. WE DIDN'T REALIZE ONE OF THE
RISKS WOULD BE THE WEATHER THERE.
BUT THEY GOT THROUGH IT, BUCKLED THROUGH IT. AND OF COURSE, THE OLYMPICS IS ALL ABOUT BATTLING WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH THE COMPETITION,
SHOWING THE STRENGTH OF HUMAN ENDURANCE. THAT'S WHAT THEY DID TONIGHT IN THIS OPENING CEREMONY WHICH WAS JUST BECAUSE OF THE RAIN.
Arsonists attack french high-speed train system
>> KEIR SIMMONS LEADING US OFF ON TOP STORY, WE APPRECIATE THAT. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE SURPRISES. THE OPENING
CEREMONY MOVED ON AS PLANNED DESPITE ANOTHER SURPRISE, ARSONISTS TACKING THE HIGH
SPEED RAIL SYSTEM, THREE DIFFERENT PLACES WERE TARGETED. IT CAUSED TRAVEL DELAYS FOR AN ESTIMATED 800,000 PEOPLE INCLUDING SOME ATHLETES ON THE WAY TO THE GAMES.
FOR THE LATEST ON THE ATTACK AND HOW FRENCH AUTHORITIES ARE RESPONDING, I WANT TO BRING IN RICHARD ENGEL. RICHARD, WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW
ABOUT WHO IS BEHIND THIS, AND WHY THEY DID IT?
>> Reporter: SO, FRENCH AUTHORITIES ARE NOT CONSIDERING THIS A TERRORIST ATTACK. THERE WERE NO PEOPLE KILLED, NO PEOPLE INJURED. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT WAS
THE INTENTION AT ANY STAGE. INSTEAD, IT WAS AN ATTACK IN AN
EFFORT TO DISRUPT THE GAMES, AND TO GET A LOT OF ATTENTION.
U.S. OFFICIALS, FRENCH OFFICIALS QUOTED IN LOCAL MEDIA BELIEVE THIS WAS THE WORK OF A FAR LEFT GROUP. THEY ARE
ANARCHISTS OR ENVIRONMENTALISTS WHO HAVE LONG BEEN OPPOSED TO THE GAME, LONG OPPOSED TO THE HIGH-SPEED RAIL NETWORK HERE,
OPPOSED TO MANY TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY SEE AS
DAMAGING TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PLANET. THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BRING THEIR CAUSE TO THE WORLD STAGE AND CAUSE DESTRUCTION. IT IS CAUSING DESTRUCTION.
300,000 PEOPLE WERE DISRUPTED TODAY, EXPECTED TO BE 800,000 BY THE TIME THEY GET THIS SYSTEM UP AND RUNNING BY MONDAY
-- IS THE HOPE. IT WAS A STRATEGIC, COORDINATED
ACT OF SABOTAGE.
THE REGULATION SYSTEM WAS DESTROYED. THE GUIDANCE SYSTEM OF THE RAIL NETWORK WAS ATTACKED IN THREE PLACES TO THE NORTH, TO THE WEST, AND TO THE EAST.
THERE WAS A FOURTH ATTEMPTED ATTACK TO THE SOUTH, NOT SURPRISINGLY, SO THEY COULD CUT OFF PARIS ENTIRELY, BUT POLICE SAY THEY WERE ABLE TO STOP THAT
ATTACK. >> RICHARD, BEFORE YOU KNOW, OUR VIEWERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN
HEARING THE SIRENS. THERE IS A MASSIVE SECURITY PRESENCE IN PARIS. WE WERE TALKING BEFORE THE BROADCAST.
YOU WERE SAYING YOU WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THERE WERE POSSIBLY MORE ATTACKS OR OTHER PLOTS TO DISRUPT THE OLYMPICS WHILE WE ARE HERE.
>> Reporter: I THINK IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THERE IS SOME BASE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE.
THERE HAS BEEN VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A LONG TIME. THERE HAVE BEEN ATTACKS,
STABBINGS, SHOOTINGS AGAINST
THE POLICE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN FRENCH SOCIETY. SO DOES, BY THE WAY, SABOTAGE ATTACKS.
SO DO DISRUPTIVE PROTESTS THAT SOMETIMES TURNED VIOLENT. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL AT ALL TO HAVE PROTESTS WHERE THE STREETS
ARE SUDDENLY BLOCKED WITH TRACTORS OR DEMONSTRATORS, OR THEY ARE SMASHING WINDOWS. THE FRENCH, I DON'T WANT TO SAY THEY ACCEPT IT, BUT THAT'S PART
OF PASSIONATE POLITICAL DISCOURSE.
WHEN HE WENT TO THE TRAIN STATION TODAY, I WAS AT THE TRAIN STATIONS AS WELL. PEOPLE WERE NOT ENRAGED. THEY WERE NOT FRIGHTENED. THEY DIDN'T CONSIDER IT A
TERRORIST ATTACK. THEY CONSIDERED IT AN INCONVENIENCE, AN ATTEMPT TO EMBARRASS THE GOVERNMENT. NOW, WE COULD SEE VIOLENCE.
YES. IT IS POSSIBLE. THERE COULD BE A STABBING ATTACK. THERE COULD BE SOME EXTREMISTS
PROFESSING A CAUSE WHO ATTACKS A GROUP OF POLICE OFFICERS, SECURITY, OR EVEN SPECTATORS. IT IS POSSIBLE, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS HAPPEN.
BUT THE -- AND THEY ARE VERY HARD TO STOP, RANKLY, ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND IN ANY PLACE.
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE AUTHORITIES HERE ARE TRYING TO STOP THAT, BUT REALLY FOCUSED ON MASS ATTACKS, MULTIPLE GUNMEN ROAMING THROUGH A LOCATION, A BOMB AT A STADIUM,
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE DEVASTATING, WOULD BE A WORLD EVENT.
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THERE COULD BE SOME LEVEL OF VIOLENCE OVER THE NEXT 2.5 WEEKS IN SOME CITY. THAT HAPPENS FAIRLY REGULARLY HERE. YEAH, I THINK IT IS NOT OUT OF
THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY AT ALL.
>> ALL RIGHT. RICHARD ENGEL REPORTING FOR US, WE APPRECIATE THAT. THE OPENING CEREMONIES WENT OFF WITHOUT A HITCH. THANKFULLY, MORE THAN 300,000 SPECTATORS WATCHED THE PARADE
OF NATIONS DURING THE OLYMPIC OPENING CEREMONY TONIGHT. MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD, THE HOTTEST TICKET, SOME PAYING THOUSANDS, AND A VERY LUCKY
LIMITED NUMBER WINNING A
LOTTERY TO HAVE A ONCE-IN-A- LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY. OUR NEXT GUEST WAS OUT THERE TONIGHT. YOU CAN SEE HER IN THIS PHOTO RIGHT HERE. NOW LIVE TONIGHT ON TOP STORY,
NIKO ANDERSON, RESIDENT OF PARIS WHO ATTENDED THE CEREMONY WITH HER HUSBAND AND FRIEND. SHE IS FROM THE U.S., FROM OHIO LIVING IN FRANCE. I SPOKE TO YOU THIS MORNING.
YOU BRAVE THE ELEMENTS. WAS IT WORTH IT? >> IT WAS MORE THAN WORTH IT. THE RAIN, I DIDN'T FEEL IT. THE CAMARADERIE, THE HISTORY,
JUST TO BE THERE, SO BLESSED. >> IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL PERFORMANCE, CEREMONY, WHAT
STOOD OUT FOR YOU? >> CELINE DION AT THE END. EVERYONE KEPT CHANTING HER NAME
AFTER EVERY GUEST. TO SEE HER AT THE END, SERENA WILLIAMS, THEN THE FLAME, IT WAS JUST AMAZING.
>> IT WAS VERY MOVING. I KNOW YOU WENT THERE WITH YOUR HUSBAND AND WITH A FRIEND OF YOURS. TALK TO ME ABOUT THE CROWD.
PEOPLE WERE LOVERS OF THE OLYMPICS, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COMING TOGETHER. >> YES, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY COMING TOGETHER, EVERYONE, THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS
RAINING, THEY PUT THE UMBRELLAS AWAY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T MATTER. THEY JUST ENJOYED THE MOMENT. SPAIN, ARGENTINA, EVERYBODY
JUST CHEERING. OF COURSE, THE AMERICAN BOAT,
WOW! IT WAS SPECTACULAR. AT THE END, THE FRENCH BOAT, EVERYONE SINGING, YES. >> FOR AMERICAN VIEWERS AT HOME
WATCHING IT, IT WAS A SPECTACLE. THERE WERE MOMENTS THAT WERE
VERY, VERY FRENCH. DID ANYTHING SURPRISE YOU? WOW! THEY WENT THERE? >> I WAS SURPRISED AT THE VERY END TO SEE WHEN THEY LIT THE
TORCH. THAT WAS KIND OF THE SECRET, I THINK. THAT WAS A SURPRISE.
JUST TO -- IT WAS JUST A SURPRISE TO BE SURROUNDED BY SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. EVERYONE WAS SO SUPPORTIVE. THAT WAS THE THING, DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES, EVERYONE IS CHEERING AND, YES. >> YOU ARE SO PROUD TO BE IN AMERICA. YOU WERE TELLING ME YOU STILL
WATCH THE TODAY SHOW. >> MY CHILDREN WERE BORN HERE.
YEAH. >> IT WAS PRETTY COOL. >> YES. >> WHEN YOU SEE THE CAULDRON, THE HOT-AIR BALLOON, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME PRIDE, I THINK,
FOR YOUR NEW COUNTRY. >> YES, I'M VERY PROUD. FRANCE PULLED IT OFF GREAT AND ALL. IT WAS ON THE RIVER. BECAUSE OF THAT, MORE PEOPLE
EVER WERE ABLE TO SEE THE GAME
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. THAT SAYS IT RIGHT THERE, HISTORY BEING MADE. >> AS WE LOOK LIVE AT THE HOT AIR BALLOON, MIKO ANDERSON, THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US.
I MEAN, UTRECHT OUT THERE,
UTRECHT BACK OVER HERE, YOU LIVED THROUGH THE RAIN, YOUR STORIES FOR A LIFETIME. >> THANK YOU. >> WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE FROM PARIS IN THE SHOW.

VANCE WAS ASKED TODAY ABOUT HIS 2021 COMMENT THAT REFERENCED HARRIS AND SAID THIS. >> WE ARE EFFECTIVELY RUNNING THE COUNTRY VIA DEMOCRATS AND
CORPORATE OLIGARCHS BY CHILDLESS CAT LADIES.
>> Reporter: IN TODAY -- >> IT WAS A SARCASTIC COMMENT. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST CATS. >> Reporter: THEN HE SAID HE HAD A BROADER POINT.
>> IT'S ABOUT CRITICIZING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR BECOMING ANTI-FAMILY AND ANTI-CHILD.
>> Reporter: MARK KELLY FIRED BACK. >> IT IS RIDICULOUS, OBNOXIOUS AND WRONG. WE REALLY WORRY ABOUT IS WHAT HE WOULD DO ONE HEARTBEAT AWAY
FROM THE PRESIDENCY. >> Reporter: MR. TRUMP POSTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT HE INTENDS TO GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITY OF BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE THE
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT HAPPENED TWO WEEKS AGO. IT KILLED A FATHER AND LEFT TO OTHERS IN THE CROWD INJURED. THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS IT IS NO LONGER DOING BIG, OUTDOOR

WORLD AT HER FIRST OLYMPICS IN 2012, WINNING GOLD IN THE WOMEN'S 800 METER FREESTYLE. SHE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST IF
One-on-one with Olympian Katie Ledecky

TO BE WITH FAST MAIL SWIMMERS,
THE TOP U.S. SWIMMERS. YOU HEARD HER. SOMETIMES, SHE CATCHES THEM. IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS FOR HER. IT'S THAT KIND OF DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT.
IT'S ALSO, LET'S FACE IT, SHE IS BORN THAT WAY. SHE HAS THIS INCREDIBLE ENGINE FOR ENDURANCE SPORTS. YOU CAN SEE IT IN ACTION. THAT IS WHY SHE CAN WIN SO
HANDILY ESPECIALLY IN LONG RACES. >> SHE COULD BECOME THE MOST DECORATED FEMALE ATHLETE IN ALL THE OLYMPICS WHICH IS INCREDIBLE. >> Reporter: SHE IS ON THE
EDGE. SHE HAS THREE COMING UP. THAT IS GOING TO BE TOUGH. SHE HAS VERY STIFF COMPETITION. A COMPETITOR FROM AUSTRALIA AND

EXCITING PART OF THIS, YOU CALL IT THE OLYMPIC GAMES AT THE CENTER. YOU SHOULD SEE A LOT OF WORLD RECORDS. IF YOU WANT TO WIN A GOLD
MEDAL, [ INAUDIBLE ] THAT'S EXCITING. >> WHAT ABOUT CALEB? HOW DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO DO
DURING THE GAMES? >> HE IS JUST MAGICAL TO BEGIN WITH. HE HAS BEEN SO HONEST AND OPEN ABOUT THE JOURNEY OF BEING AN
OLYMPIC CHAMPION, COMING BACK AFTER THAT GLORIOUS MOMENT WHERE HE WAS FOREVER INTRODUCED
AS THE ELLIPTIC CHAMPION. IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY, IT'S NOT ALWAYS PERFECT HERE HE HAS BEEN OPEN ABOUT THAT PROCESS.
IT WAS A HUGE SENSE OF RELIEF. AND ALSO GRATITUDE WHEN HE
QUALIFIED FOR THE LIMIT GAMES. HE IS COMING IN WITH SUCH A DIFFERENT MINDSET. HE IS PROBABLY SOAKING UP EVERY SINGLE MOMENT OF IT.
AND THAT PUTS THEM IN A POSITION TO DO AMAZING THINGS. >> FINALLY, SUMMER, YOU WON A GOLD MEDALS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
PRACTICE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE UP TO AN ENTIRE POINT AND SHOW UP ON
THE STAGE IN THE WORLD. TALK ABOUT THE MOMENT PEOPLE JUMP INTO THE POOL KNOWING THEY HAVE TRAINED SO HARD, THEY WILL EITHER COME HOME WITH SOME KIND
OF MIDDLE OR NOT. >> IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. I HAD TEARS IN MY EYES. TONIGHT, THE MESSAGE WE HEARD
WAS BEING AN OLYMPIAN IS THE MOST AMAZING THING. WHAT YOU DO ON THAT IS THE
CHERRY ON TOP.
YES. YOU TRAIN YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS MOMENT. THE MOMENT IS NOT ONE MOMENT. I'M SITTING HERE IN THE USA
HOUSE LISTENING TO THE CHEERING.
IT IS A MOMENT WHEN THE WORLD COMES TOGETHER AS ONE. WE AS A COUNTRY WILL COME TOGETHER AS ONE. IT IS GREATER THAN ANY GOLD
MEDAL. THE ATHLETES FEEL LIKE IT'S PART OF IT. YES, MEDALS ARE AWESOME.

LIST OF CARTEL LEADERS AND ASSOCIATES WHOM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE IN THE UNITED STATES. >> Reporter: AMONG THOSE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE, EL CHAPO, WHO
WAS CAPTURED IN MEXICO AND EXTRADITED TO THE U.S. IN 2016. HE IS CURRENTLY SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE IN A MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON AFTER BEING CONVICTED OF
DRUG TRAFFICKING, MONEY LAUNDERING, AND WEAPONS CHARGES. FOUR OF HIS SONS KNOWN AS THE CHIPPY TOES ARE FOUND TO HAVE TAKEN UP CARTEL ORGANIZATIONS AFTER HIS FATHER'S ARREST.
>> THEY TORTURE AND KILL THE VICTIMS. THEY FED SOME OF THE VICTIMS, DEAD AND ALIVE, TO TARGETS -- TIGERS BELONGING TO THEM.
>> Reporter: TONIGHT, TWO OF THEM ARE IN CUSTODY. LAST YEAR, A VIDEO SHOWED HE
WAS EXTRADITED TO THE U.S. IN SEPTEMBER, HE PLED NOT GUILTY TO DRUG AND MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES. PRESIDENT BIDEN COMMENDING THE JOINT HOMELAND SECURITY DEA AND
FBI EFFORT SAYING, QUOTE, TOO MANY OF OUR CITIZENS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES TO THE SCORCH OF FENTANYL. TOO MANY FAMILIES HAVE BEEN BROKEN AND ARE SUFFERING
BECAUSE OF THIS DESTRUCTIVE DRUG. >> THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL NOT REST UNTIL EVERY SINGLE CARTEL LEADER, MEMBER, AND ASSOCIATE RESPONSIBLE FOR
POISONING OUR COMMUNITIESIS
HELD ACCOUNTABLE. >> Reporter: TONIGHT, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER GUZMAN-LOPEZ TO ANY OF THE LENIENCY HE WAS HOPING FOR. >> JUSTICE AND INTELLIGENCE
CORRESPONDENT KEN DELANEY AND JOINS US NOW. THESE MEN LANDED IN NEW MEXICO THEN FLEW TO EL PASO WHERE THEY WERE ARRESTED AS WE SAW IN YOUR
PIECE. WHAT COMES NEXT? >> Reporter: GUZMAN LOPEZ
WAIVED HIS FIRST APPEARANCE. HE WAS FLOWN IN AN FBI PLANE TO CHICAGO WHERE WE BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO FACE SOME SORT OF FEDERAL OR CRIMINAL CHARGES.
IT APPEARS THE FATE OF THESE MEN WILL DIVERGE. GUZMAN LOPEZ MADE A DEAL. HE WILL GET SOME BENEFIT FOR
THAT. THE OTHER MAN IS ONE OF THE MOST WANTED DRUG LORDS IN THE WORLD. THE U.S. IS TRYING TO THROW THE BOOK AT HIM.
Maduro facing loss in 2024 Venezuela elections
THERE ARE ANOTHER NUMBER OF CHARGES HE COULD FACE. AND IF HE FOLLOWS THE FATE OF EL CHAPO, HE WOULD END UP WITH LIFE IN PRISON IN A MEXICO --
MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. >> KEN DELANEY AND, THANK YOU. >>> NOW TO THE AMERICANS,
VOTERS IN VENEZUELA ARE PREPARING FOR A MONUMENTAL ELECTION, THE REIGNING PRESIDENT, NICOLAS MADURO,
SEEKING ANOTHER TERM IN OFFICE. OTHERS ARE URGING HIM TO
ACCEPT THE ELECTION RESULTS FROM 2018 WHICH WAS CONSIDERED BY THE U.S. AND OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES TO BE A SHAM. HE SAID IN A RECENT BROADCAST
HE WILL WIN BY, QUOTE, A LANDSLIDE. HE FACES OVERWHELMING COMPETITION. THE OPPOSITION CANDIDATE IS
PULLING 59 POINTS AHEAD. FOR MORE ON THIS UPCOMING ELECTION, I WANT TO BRING IN ONE WHO JOINS US FROM MIAMI. THE U.S. AND VENEZUELA HAVE HAD
A VERY STRAINED RELATIONSHIP UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP. HE HAS BEEN CRITICIZED AS A DICTATOR, ACCUSED OF TAKING POLITICAL PRISONERS. HOW SIGNIFICANT COULD HIS
ELECTION LOSS BE TO VENEZUELA AND THE REST OF THE AMERICAS INCLUDING THE U.S.? >> Reporter: THIS WOULD CHANGE
EVERYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VENEZUELA. SO, FIRST OFF, NICOLAS MADURO
HAS DONE EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO STOP THE OPPOSITION, NOT ALLOWING MARIA CORINA
MACHADO TO RUN THE GOVERNMENT, BANNED HER FROM RUNNING. THEY DID EXPECT THE OPPOSITION TO NAME ANOTHER CANDIDATE, A SURROGATE WHO THEY HAVE NOW,
WHO HAS ALREADY SAID THAT MARIA CORINA MACHADO WILL HAVE ANY ROLE SHE WANTS IN THE GOVERNMENT IF HE IS ELECTED.
SO, IF NICOLAS MADURO WERE TO
LOSE AND GET POWER TO THE OPPOSITION, THIS WOULD CHANGE EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY FOR THE U.S. BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VENEZUELA IS PRETTY MUCH BROKEN.
WE HAVE A CRISIS OF IMMIGRATION IN THE U.S. MANY MIGRANTS COMING FROM VENEZUELA. WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE AN AGREEMENT WHERE THE U.S. CAN REPATRIATE VENEZUELANS ON A
DAILY BASIS.
THERE COULD BE BETTER DEALS WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION WITH THE U.S. AND VENEZUELA, ALSO WITH THE ECONOMY, ALL SORTS OF THINGS WOULD CHANGE OR
IMPROVE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VENEZUELA IF NICOLAS MADURO LOSES. >> LOOKING BACK AT THE LAST ELECTION IN 2018, THAT WAS BELIEVED BY WESTERN COUNTRIES
TO HAVE BEEN A SHAM WITH NICOLAS MADURO CLAIMING A FALSE VICTORY. IT LOOKS LIKE HE COULD LIKELY LOSE THIS RACE. CAN WE EXPECT HIM TO ACCEPT THE
RESULTS OF THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS? >> Reporter: THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN QUESTIONS, RIGHT? WHAT WILL HE DO IF THERE IS A LOSS AND THERE'S NOTHING HE CAN
SAY? SOME EXPERTS SAY HE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO RIGGED THE SYSTEM. HE WOULD REQUIRE EVERYONE INTERNALLY TO SUPPORT SOME TYPE
OF WAY OF RIGGING THE SYSTEM. SO, IF THERE'S ENOUGH OBSERVERS, THE DIFFERENCE IS SO BIG THAT
NOTHING CAN BE DONE AND THE OPPOSITION WINS, HE WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT LOSS WITH PRESSURE FROM BRAZIL, PRESSURE FROM COLUMBIA, ALLIES FOR HIM
TO ACCEPT A RESULT IF HE DOES LOSE THE ELECTION, VALERIE. >> THERE ARE SO MANY EYES ON THE ELECTION. HOW ARE THE VOTERS FEELING
ABOUT IT? >> Reporter: WELL, VOTERS SAY, THEY ARE LOOKING AT SUNDAY. THEY PLAN TO SPEND THE WHOLE
DAY VOTING OR OBSERVING VOTING SITES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE NOBODY CHEATS, OF COURSE. WHEN WE SPEAK TO VOTERS THAT ARE IN VENEZUELA AND HAVE
FAMILIES WHO LEFT, THEY'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS WOULD MEAN FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY, MORE THAN 8 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE LEFT VENEZUELA.
THIS IS SOMETHING PEOPLE TALK ABOUT. LET'S HEAR FROM A VOTER WHO TOLD US WHAT HE INKS WOULD HAPPEN IF HE WINS OR LOSES.
>> DEPENDING ON WHO WINS THE ELECTION, HOW WILL THIS CHANGE THINGS FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY?
>> THERE IS NO OPTION FOR ME. THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT CONTINUES, WE WILL SEE THE
LARGEST IMMIGRATION IN HISTORY. OKAY? OTHERWISE, EVERYBODY WILL
RETURN TO THEIR HOMES, IMMEDIATELY. >> AND THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF THE MIGRANTSLY.
Lester Holt reflects on historic opening ceremony
I WAS LIKE YOU IN THE SAME POSITION, MY FRIEND. >> ME? NO, NO, NO. THIS WAS A CHURCH THEME KIND OF PARTY. NONE OF THAT WAS GOING ON.
KEIR SIMMONS, WE ALWAYS THANK YOU. >> Reporter: SURE.
>> JOINING US NOW IS NIGHTLY NEWS ANCHOR LESTER HOLT. HE HAS COVERED 11 OLYMPIC GAMES
FOR ASSET NBC NEWS. OF COURSE, WE THANK YOU FOR BEING ON TOP STORY TONIGHT. YOU'VE COVERED 11 OLYMPICS. I KNOW YOUR FIRST WITH SALT
LAKE CITY RIGHT AFTER 9/11. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH AN INCREDIBLE NEW CYCLE, AND ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION ON FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WE ARE HERE IN PARIS. SOMETIMES WE IN THE U.S. AND THE WORLD NEED THE OLYMPICS. >> THAT'S A GOOD POINT. WE ARE DEEP INTO IT.
IT IS COMING 90 MILES PER HOUR. PEOPLE KEEP STOPPING ME, INCLUDING HERE, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? YOU KNOW, THE OLYMPICS WEREN'T DESIGNED AS AN EVENT TO MAKE
PEOPLE FEEL BETTER. BUT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. WE CAN WALK AND CHEW GUM.
WE CAN COVER NEWS TO CELEBRATE.
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD AGREE IT IS A GOOD TIME RIGHT NOW TO CELEBRATE OUR COUNTRY IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY.
>> AS REPORTERS AND BROADCASTERS, A LOT OF TIMES, WE MEET PEOPLE ON THE WORST DAYS OF THEIR LIVES.
THIS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR WHAT WE DO TO TELL A DIFFERENT KIND OF STORY, STORY THAT IS USUALLY HELPFUL. >> USUALLY WHEN TALKING ABOUT
THE OLYMPICS, YOU MEET PEOPLE WHO TOIL IN OBSCURITY FOR
MONTHS, YEAR AFTER YEAR WORKING ON THEIR CRAFT. THEN SUDDENLY, THEY ARE IN THE LIMELIGHT. SUDDENLY, THEY ARE HOUSEHOLD
NAMES. THEY COME TO OUR SETS, THEY HAVE THEIR GOLD MEDALS ON, AND
THEIR STORIES, IT IS WONDERFUL. >> YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY DONE A LOT OF ANCHORING AND REPORTING.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME REPORTING YOU DID IN BEIJING WHERE YOU TOOK A BICYCLE AND ESSENTIALLY SHOWED AMERICANS WHAT LIFE WAS LIKE IN
CHINA. >> THAT WAS BACK IN 2008 WHEN A LARGE NUMBER OF CHINESE PEOPLE RODE BIKES.
IT CLEARLY STILL HAPPENS AS WELL. THE RATIO HAS BEEN DROPPING. WE WANTED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO COMMUTE IN A CITY LIKE
THAT ON A BIKE. IT WAS A LITTLE FOOLHARDY, BUT IT WAS A GOOD INSIGHT INTO HOW THE COUNTRY WAS MODERNIZING AT THE TIME. YOU GOT TO ADMIT, RELATIONS
WERE A LITTLE EASIER IN 2008 AS THEY PUT ON A SPECTACULAR -- ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE SHOWS I'VE SEEN. >> IT'S AMAZING.
THEY WANT TO SHOWCASE COUNTRIES. SOMETIMES WITH CHINA, IT PEELS BACK THE CURTAIN. VIEWERS GET A SENSE OF HOW THOSE COUNTRIES ARE.
>> I THINK EVERYONE WANTS TO GET AN IDEA WHAT THE COUNTRIES ARE LIKE. THEY SPEND A LOT OF MONEY, A LOT OF EFFORT. THE HOURS OF PRIME TIME
COVERAGE, TO KIND OF MAKE A CASE
ABOUT THEIR INNOVATION AND THEIR PROGRESS AS A NATION. >> I KNOW YOU ARE EXCITED BUT A COUPLE DIFFERENT EVENTS IN PARIS, NAMELY TABLE NNIS.
>> YEAH, TABLE TENNIS. I HAVEN'T PLAYED IN A WHILE.
BUT BEFORE THERE WAS PICKLE BALL, THERE WAS TABLE TENNIS. I THINK WE DID THAT, ACTUALLY, IN BEIJING WITH ONE OF THE LOCALS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
>> WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT? >> IT'S THE SPEED, PUTTING THE SPIN ON IT.
>> THEY PLAY AT AN INTENSE PACE. >> THEY TAKE THAT THING GOING 90 MILES PER HOUR. IT'S JUST A FUN GAME.
I WAS IN A PING-PONG CLUB FOR A WILD. >> THAT DOES NOT SURPRISE ME. THAT IS AMAZING.
>> WHEN I SAID PING-PONG, IT IS TABLE TENNIS. >> YOU HAVE BEEN TO 11 OLYMPICS. RIGHT? WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED? >> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALL
TIME. PEOPLE JUST WANT TO CELEBRATE LIFE, AND THEIR CRAFT.
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN THE TIME AND THE EFFORT TO DEVELOP THESE SKILLS IN SPORTS THAT MANY OF US DON'T KNOW VERY WELL.
IT IS JUST A GREAT MOMENT. AS CORNY AS IT SOUNDS, TO COME
TOGETHER, CELEBRATE THESE PEOPLE, WHAT THEY CAN DO, AND KIND OF MAKES YOU WONDER, WHAT AM I CAPABLE OF? >> I BELIEVE ALL OF THAT.
LESTER HOLT, HE ANCHORS THE NEWS, HE PLAYS BASS, HE PLAYS PING-PONG. HE IS TRULY
