THE USA WOMEN'S AND MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAMS DOMINATING THE COMPETITION IN THEIR FIRST
GAMES IN GROUP PLAY. IN A REMATCH, THE WOMEN'S SQUAD DISMANTLING JAPAN 102-76.
TWO TIME WNBA CHAMPION ASIA
WILSON LEADING ALL SCORERS WITH 24 POINTS. THE MEN'S TEAM YESTERDAY EASING PAST SERBIA IN WHAT WAS EXPECTED TO BE THEIR TOUGHEST
GAME RUNNING BY A WHOPPING 26 POINTS. FOR MORE ON USA'S DOMINANCE ON
THE COURT, KAYLEE HARTUNG JOINS ME NOW. SO GREAT TO SEE YOU HERE IN PARIS. LET'S START WITH THE WOMEN'S TEAM GOING FOR A RECORD EIGHTH GOLD MEDAL IN A ROW.
HOW DID THEY WIN AGAINST JAPAN?
>> THIS IS A REMATCH OF A GOLD MEDAL GAME FROM TOKYO YOU WOULD THINK THIS IS A TOUGH PLACE TO
START AND IT WAS IN A LOT OF WAYS BECAUSE THE WAY TOKYO PLAYS ON OFFENSE THEY PLAY QUICK, THEY PLAY FAST, THEY KNOW EACH OTHER REALLY WELL BUT
IT WILL CHALLENGE ANY DEFENSE. THE U.S. HAD A HARD TIME SETTLING IN, THEY COULDN'T HIT A THREE IN THE FIRST HALF, THEY ONLY HAD ONE, IT MADE YOU THINK
WHERE IS CAITLIN CLARK, COULD SHE HIT ONE IF SHE WAS HERE? BUT IN THE SECOND HALF THEY SETTLED IN AND ABSOLUTELY DOMINATED. HEAD COACH CHERYL REEVE HAS HAD
A BIT OF A HARD TIME PINNING DOWN WHAT MAKES THIS TEAM SO
DOMINANT IS IT DEPTH? IS IT SIZE?
IT'S 1A, 1B. OPPONENTS BEWARE . >> WHY ISN'T CAITLIN CLARK HERE?
>> COMPLICATED QUESTION IN THE SENSE THAT HER WNBA CAREER HAD JUST BEGAN. SHE HAD A MONTH OF PLAY WHEN
THEY SELECTED THIS TEAM BACK ON JUNE 11th. HER PLAY HAS GOTTEN CONSIDERABLY BETTER AS SHE HAS SETTLED INTO HER ROLE IN THE
WNBA SO A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO,
DALY SAID, IF WE WERE CHOOSING
NOW, IT MIGHT'VE MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION. >> THAT IS CRAZY. LET'S TALK THE U.S. MEN'S TEAM. THEY ARE LOOKING GREAT GETTING COMPARED TO THE DREAM TEAM IN
1992. HOW DO THEY LOOK AGAINST SERBIA? A SLOW START?
>> LIKE THE WOMEN, SLOW START BUT THEY SETTLED IN. THIS TEAM DID NOT START KEVIN DURANT. HE HADN'T PLAYED A GAME IN
NEARLY THREE MONTHS SO STEVE KERR SAID HE WANTED TO EASE HIM
IN. IN KEVIN DURANT'S OVER 1000 GAMES IN THE NBA HE'S ONLY COME OFF THE BENCH THREE TIMES. MAKE THIS TIME NUMBER FOUR IF YOU WILL AND HE PLAYED LIKE A
MAN POSSESSED. THROUGHOUT THE GAME ONCE HE GOT ON THE COURT, HE ONLY MISSED
ONE SHOT THAT HE TOOK. HE HAD 23, LeBRON HAD 21, LeBRON WAS DOING WHAT LeBRON
DOES, THE -- BEATING EVERYONE TO THE BALL AND GETTING IT INTO THE NET. A SIMILAR STORY TO THE WOMEN,
SO MUCH DEPTH ON THIS ROSTER WHEN YOU CAN BRING KEVIN DURANT OFF THE BENCH.
>> OTHER COUNTRIES MAY HAVE NBA PLAYERS BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE AMOUNT OF NBA TALENT THAT OUR TEAM HAS. THEY ARE GOING TO PLAY SOUTH SUDAN. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY SOUTH
SUDAN BUT YOU CAN'T SLEEP ON SOUTH SUDAN. >> YOU CAN'T. THERE WAS AN EXHIBITION GAME A COUPLE WEEKS AGO IN LONDON. ONE POINT. THE U.S. A LAY-UP BY LeBRON
JAMES WITH EIGHT SECONDS LEFT. FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IN THAT GAME, SOUTH SUDAN HAD A CONSIDERABLE LEAD TO BUT OF COURSE THE U.S. GOT DASHES
>> YOU WERE TELLING ME SOMETHING ELSE, RIGHT? THE WHOLE A TEAM WAS PLAYING, RIGHT? >> ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS WAS DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME WHEN HE WAS OUT WITH THE
STRAINED CALF THAT HE WAS DEALING WITH AND THIS IS THE CHALLENGE FOR BOTH TEAM USA'S
MEN AND WOMEN. THEY DON'T SPEND AS MUCH TIME PLAYING TOGETHER AHEAD OF THE OLYMPICS AS OTHER COUNTRIES DO BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEIR PROFESSIONAL CAREERS IN THE WNBA AND THE NBA AND THE
COMMITMENTS THOSE BRING. SO THEY ARE GETTING ADJUSTED TO ONE ANOTHER BUT WHEN THE LIGHTS SHINE THE BRIGHTEST, YOU KNOW THESE STARS PLAY THEIR ABSOLUTE BEST. >> THE WOMEN'S TEAM WILL FACE
OFF AGAINST BELGIUM IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. DO THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT? IS THERE ANYONE THAT CAN MATCH UP AGAINST THEM? >> I DON'T THINK THE WOMEN HAVE
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT IN
PARIS. PERIOD. THE END.
THIS IS A WINNING STREAK FOR TEAM USA BASKETBALL IN THE OLYMPICS THAT DATES BACK TO BEFORE MANY OF THE PLAYERS ON THIS ROSTER WERE EVEN BORN, 1992.
THOSE OLYMPICS WERE THE LAST TIME THE TEAM USA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL LOST A GAME ON THE STAGE, BUT AS WITH ANY GREAT TEAM, WITH ANY TEAM OF DOMINANCE, THAT LEGACY BRINGS
PRESSURE WITH IT. THIS TEAM HAS TALKED A LOT ABOUT TRYING TO CREATE THEIR OWN IDENTITY, NOT THINK ABOUT THE PAST JUST LOOKED TARDS
THE FUTURE BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOAL IS. ONE GOAL AWAY AND IT'S TO WIN
AN ACE GOLD. >> INCREDIBLE LEGACY. THANK YOU . >>> FOR MORE ON OLYMPIC COVERAGE LET'S GO TO NBC SPORTS
OLYMPIC STUDIOS. JOINING US NOW IS SCOTT HANSEN, THE HOST OF GOLD ZONE ON
PEACOCK. SCOTT IS ALSO ANCHOR AND REPORTER FOR THE NFL NETWORK. SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU TONIGHT. I JUST GOT BACK FROM MEN'S GYMNASTICS AT THE ARENA.
IT WAS INCREDIBLE. WHAT A GREAT GROUP OF GUYS AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THE JAPANESE, THE CHINESE, THEY WERE SO INTENSE AND TEAM USA
CAME OUT AND THEY SURPRISED
EVERYONE. >> ABSOLUTELY. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU AND ON GOLD ZONE WE GO 10 STRAIGHT HOURS AND WE SHOW YOU EVERY MEDAL EVENT.
THERE WERE 12 TOTAL GOLD MEDALS WON, BUT THAT BRONZE SECURED BY THE MEN'S TEAM IN GYMNASTICS
FOR THE USA, THAT BRONZE PROBABLY FELT LIKE GOLD. THE LAST THREE OLYMPICS WENT
FIFTH-PLACE, FIFTH-PLACE AND
DEFIED SOME ODDS TO COME THROUGH WHEN IT MATTERED FIRST IN FRONT OF THE WORLD STAGE AND GET ON THE PODIUM. THAT WAS A SWEET MOMENT FOR TEAM USA.
SO, IN GOLD ZONE YOU GOT SOME OF THE BEST MOMENTS OVER THOSE 10 HOURS. A BIG DAY AND SWIMMING TONIGHT AS WELL AND U.S. WOMEN'S RUGBY? >> YEAH, U.S. WOMEN'S RUG, BOTH
RUGBY TEAMS FOR THE UNITED STATES, MEN'S AND WOMEN'S LOOKS PRETTY GOOD AND I THINK RUGBY IS CATCHING ON MORE STATESIDE
BECAUSE IT'S AMERICAN FOOTBALL OF COURSE IS THE NUMBER ONE SPORT HERE IN THE USA AND RUGBY
IS THE OLYMPIC SPORT WHICH PROBABLY MOST TRANSLATES TO IT. NEITHER THE U.S. MEN NOR THE U.S. WOMEN'S RUG TEAM HAS EVER
ADVANCED TO THE SEMI FINALS BUT THE WOMEN WERE ABLE TO GET IT DONE IN THEIR QUARTERFINAL MATCHUP TODAY SO THEY ARE GOING TO PLAY FOR A MEDAL AND WHO
KNOWS, IT COULD BE GOLD. WE WILL HAVE THAT FOR YOU ON TUESDAY ON GOLD ZONE.
>> YOU ARE WATCHING ALL THIS COVERAGE, TALKING NONSTOP, DOING THE RESEARCH, WHAT OTHER EVENTS ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN THE COMING DAYS?
>> THE GREAT THING ABOUT GOLD ZONE IS, THERE IS 39 SPORTS IN THE OLYMPICS WITH MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES AND EVENTS OF COURSE SO THERE ARE 329 MEDAL
EVENTS IN THESE OLYMPICS. WITH GOLD ZONE AND THROUGH THE POWER OF NBC SPORTS AND THE
INCREDIBLE TEAM THAT SURROUNDS US HERE, WE ARE ABLE TO CHECK EVERYTHING. WE WATCH EVERYTHING SO YOU CAN WATCH THE BEST THINGS ARE THE
WAY I LIKE TO PUT IT MORE COLLOQUIALLY IS, THE TEAM AT
NBC SPORTS IS GOING TO TAP ME ON THE SHOULDER WHEN I NEED TO TAP THE UNITED STATES ON THE SHOULDER TO SAY I NEED YOUR ATTENTION RIGHT NOW.
WATER POLO, THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON, GREAT. OR OVER IN GYMNASTICS WE'VE GOT TO SHOW YOU THIS RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE POOL RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A GOLD MEDAL
ALERT GOING ON SO WE GOING WITH A PLAN EACH DAY BUT THEN THE GAMES ARE THE GAMES AND THEY ARE ORGANIC AND UNIQUE TO EVERY HOST CITY AND EVERY FOUR YEARS
SOMETHING FRESH POPS UP AND THE GREAT NEWS IS WHATEVER DOES HAPPEN YOU WILL SEE IT LIVE OR SECONDS AFTER IT HAPPENS ON
GOLD ZONE. >> SCOTT, I KNOW PEOPLE KNOW YOU AND LOVE YOU FROM RED ZONE. SIMILAR IDEA WITH GOLD ZONE WHICH IS SO SPECIAL THAT WE ARE
OFFERING THAT AND SOME PEOPLE MAY BE WATCHING YOU GOING THIS GUY HAS GOT THE EASIEST JOB,
HE'S IN THE STUDIO, THE AIR CONDITIONING, HE'S WATCHING TV ALL DAY, BUT YOU HAVE THE SCARS TO PROVE IT, RIGHT? IT'S NOT AN EASY JOB AND SOMETIMES THINGS GET UGLY AND
THEY GET DANGEROUS. TALK TO OUR VIEWERS ABOUT THAT?
>> ARE YOU REFERRING TO WHAT JUST HAPPENED ON THE LATEST EDITION OF GOLD ZONE? UNDOUBTEDLY YOU ARE. SO I GUESS LET THE STORY BE
TOLD RIGHT NOW. I'M DOING THIS INTERVIEW WITH A BANDAGE ON MY FINGER.
THE SICKLY THE STORY IS THIS. THE MEN'S 200 METER FREESTYLE GOLD MEDAL EVENT IN SWIMMING WAS HAPPENING. I WAS INTRODUCING THE DIFFERENT
SWIMMERS THAT WERE COMING OUT. THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMERICAN WHO WAS IN THE FIELD.
LUKE HOBSON AND RIGHT BEFORE THE RACE STARTED I JUST SAID, BY THE WAY, THERE IS ONE AMERICAN IN THIS RACE, LUKE
HOBSON. THE EXPERTS WERE SAYING HE WAS GOING TO FINISH SEVENTH. SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH OUT OF EIGHT BUT I SAID, LUKE HOBSON
IS GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THE SWIM OF HIS LIFE TO GET A
MEDAL. WELL DON'T YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING GOOSEBUMPS FOR CALLING THIS RIGHT NOW. AS THE RACE IS GOING ON HE HITS THE TURN, COMING HOME HE WAS IN
THIRD PLACE AND HE JUST OUT TOUCHED THE OTHER SWIMMERS TO
SECURE A BRONZE MEDAL. HE HAD THE GREATEST SWIM OF HIS LIFE ON THE BIGGEST STAGE OF HIS LIFE. AND I POUNDED THE DESK AS HE
WAS DOING IT IN SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY WITH HIM, SLICED MY
FINGER OPEN ON THE ACRYLIC SHARP DISCS -- DESKS THAT THEY HAVE HERE AND, CURT SCHILLING
HAD HIS BLOODY SOCK, I HAVE MY BLOODY SCRIPT RIGHT HERE.
TAKING ONE FOR THE TEAM. TAKING ONE FOR TEAM USA OUT HERE ON GOLD ZONE. >> WE SAW THE TWEET, WE SAW THE
SCRIPTS. THEY ARE PUTTING THAT UP IN A MUSEUM. I'M SURE THAT'S GOING TO BE UP THERE. WE THANK YOU.

IS STEPHANIE GOSK WHO JOINS US NOW FROM PARIS. SO GREAT TO SEE YOU. I WANT TO START WAS SIMONE BILES. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS INJURY?
EVERYONE SAW WHAT HAPPENED THERE AT THE GYMNASTICS ARENA AND THEN WE HEARD FROM HER COACH AFTER. EXPLAIN IT TO OUR VIEWERS?
>> WHAT HAPPENED, SHE CAME OUT TO DO HER FLOOR EXERCISE, TO WARM UP AND SHE CLEARLY TWEAKED HER LEFT CALF. SHE THEN WENT BACK OUT, SHE
CAME BACK IN AND HER LEFT ANKLE WAS WRAPPED UP, BUT CONSIDER
THIS, AFTER THAT MOMENT SHE DID THE FLOOR, SHE DID THE VAULTS TWICE AND THEN SHE DID THE BEAM
AND SHE ENDED UP HAVING THE HIGHEST ALL-AROUND SCORE FOR THIS OLYMPIC CYCLE.
HER COACH POINTING OUT IF IT HAD BEEN THAT SERIOUS OF AN INJURY, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO ANY OF THAT.
>> IT'S A GOOD POINT AND EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE WATCHING TOMORROW. AT 27 YEARS OLD, WE KNOW BILES LEADS THE OLDEST TEAM THE
AMERICANS HAVE BROUGHT TO THE OLYMPICS. DO THEY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO GO FOR GOLD AND TELL OUR
VIEWERS WHAT ELSE YOU ARE WATCHING FOR BESIDES SIMONE BILES BECAUSE THIS TEAM IS SO STACKED. >> LISTEN, THIS TEAM ALMOST ALL OF THEM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
ONE WAS IN TOKYO BUT SIMONE BILES, THIS IS HER THIRD OLYMPICS. IT USED TO BE IN GYMNASTICS YOU
HAD ONE OLYMPICS IN YOUR CAREER AND NOW SHE HAS TWO AND THIS IS HER THIRD AND SHE IS PROVING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT SHE HAS
THIS LONGEVITY AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU DO HAVE A DEEP TEAM HERE AND ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME INJURIES AND TRIALS, YOU HAVE SUNI LEE. SHE WON THE
GOLD MEDAL IN THE ALL-AROUND IN TOKYO. THIS IS A VERY STRONG TEAM AND THEY ARE HUNGRY BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT THE SILVER IN TOKYO AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT REDEMPTION.
SIMONE BILES REDEMPTION BUT IT'S THE WHOLE TEAM. >> STEPHANIE GOSK FOR US TONIGHT. THANK YOU.
>>> TOP STORIES TOP FANS.

YOU GUYS ARE PARISIANS BUT YOU ARE AMERICANS RIGHT? >> CHICAGOANS BY BIRTH, PARISIANS THE LAST YEAR.
>> I KNOW YOU DID GYMNASTICS GROWING UP. HOW GREAT WAS IT WATCHING THIS?
WHAT DID YOU THINK FROM WATCHING THEM? AS A GYMNAST WERE YOU JUST LIKE THEY ARE SO INCREDIBLE? >> INCREDIBLE. ALL THE GYMNASTS ARE INCREDIBLE BUT WHEN TEAM USA WALKS IN THEY
ARE QUITE A FEW STEPS ABOVE. >> YOU GUYS LIVE HERE IN PARIS, YOU ARE FROM CHICAGO. A LOT OF USA FANS BROUGHT A
FRENCH FANS, EVERYBODY IS IN THE STADIUMS . >> EVERYONE REALLY COMES
TOGETHER AND WANTS TO SEE THE BESTF THE BEST PERFORM AT THEIR BEST AS WELL. NO MATTER WHAT FLAG YOU ARE CARRYING OR WHAT CLOTHES YOU
HAD ON, EVERYONE WAS CHEERING FOR THE BEST AT THE EVENT.
>> ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE OLYMPICS THAT I REALIZED QUICKLY IS THAT AS OPPOSED TO SPORTS IN AMERICA THERE IS NO BOOING. EVERYONE IS VERY FRIENDLY AND
VERY SUPPORTIVE. >> EXCEPT FOR FOOTBALL.
SOCCER. 100%. >> YOU GUYS WERE THERE WHEN SIMONE BILES, IT'S BEEN CALLED AN INJURY IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT IT
IS. HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN IT? >> FIRST WE WERE UNSURE BECAUSE SHE CLEARLY IMMEDIATELY WALKS RIGHT OFF THE FLOOR AND DID NOT
COME BACK SO WE WEREN'T SURE IF SHE WAS GOING TO COMPETE AND SHE CAME BACK AND SHE WAS
INCREDIBLE SO I KNOW SHE'S PROBABLY USED TO TOUGHING IT OUT BUT SHE DID A GREAT JOB SO.
>> I WAS TEXTING BACK WITH PEOPLE AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING IN THE U.S. THAT WERE WATCHING AND ON TV COVERAGE THEY GIVE A
LITTLE MORE INFO AND LET US KNOW HE WAS A CALF STRAIN.
THAT'S HOW WE WERE GETTING THE INFO. >> I KNOW YOU GUYS AREN'T DOCTORS. DID IT SEEM MORE SERIOUS OR DID IT SEEM LIKE SOMETHING SHE
COULD PUSH THROUGH. SHE FINISHED ALL THE EVENTS. >> IT WAS HARD TO TELL BECAUSE SHE IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE FLOOR. A BUNCH OF PEOPLE CAME UP TO HER AND WE DIDN'T SEE HER AGAIN
SO HE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BUT THEN SHE CAME BACK, SHE DID THE FLOOR IN THE VAULT WAS
INCREDIBLE SO. >> AFTER THE FLOOR SHE LIMPED OFF SO WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE WORSE THAN THAT BUT FOR THE VAULT YOU COULDN'T TELL ANYTHING ANYMORE AND SHE WAS
PERFECT ON BARS. >> I KNOW YOU'VE GONE TO OTHER OLYMPICS. WINTER OLYMPICS. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE?
>> WHAT'S REALLY NICE ABOUT THIS ONE IS IT IS SO CONCENTRATED IN THE CITY CENTER.
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO TO SO MUCH JUST RIGHT HERE WITH THE METRO OR THE BUS TO GET TO.
THE WINTER OLYMPICS ARE MORE SPREAD OUT WITH THE VENUES GETTING TO THE MOUNTAINS AND THESE ARE BIGGER AS WELL. BUT WE ARE REALLY ENJOYING
OURSELVES HERE. >> YOU GUYS HAVING A GOOD TIME? >> WE ARE HAVING A GREAT TIME. >> THANK YOU FOR BEING THE FIRST SET OF TOP FANS HERE ON

MILITARY PRESENCE IN JAPAN AS TENSIONS ESCALATE WITH CHINA. THE BILATERAL DEAL WITH THE -- WILL ESTABLISH -- UNDER THREE- STAR GENERAL. IT WILL ALSO INCREASE PRODUCTION OF AIR DEFENSE
WEAPONS AMID CONCERNS STEMMING FROM WHAT THE U.S. AND JAPAN SEE AS INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE MOVES FROM CHINA AND NORTH
KOREA IN THE INDO PACIFIC REGION. THE MOVE FOLLOWS A LANDMARK SUMMIT WITH SOUTH KOREA AS THE THREE COUNTRIES LOOK TO SUSTAIN
PEACE AND DEEPEN SECURITY TIES. SOME BEACHGOERS IN RHODE ISLAND MET WITH A SWARM OF UNWANTED
GUESTS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. NEW VIDEO SHOWS BEACHGOERS TAKING COVER AS THOUSANDS OF
DRAGONFLIES INVADE A WESTERLY BEACH. NO WORD YET ON JUST WHY OR HOW THAT HAPPENED. LUCKILY NO ONE WAS HURT WHILE
TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM THE INSECTS. >>> POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH IN COLON CANCER SCREENING.
THE TEST WOULD NEED TO BE GIVEN EVERY THREE YEARS STARTING AT THE AGE OF 45. THE SAME AGE IT IS RECOMMENDED TO BEGIN COLORECTAL SCREENING.
HOWEVER HEALTH OFFICIALS HOPE IT CAN EVENTUALLY BE USED TO
TEST PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO YOUNG FOR ROUTINE COLONOSCOPIES. IT IS A TYPE OF CANCER THAT IS
THE SECOND HIGHEST CAUSE OF CANCER DEATHS IN THE UNITED STATES. >>> WE TURN NOW TO THE AMERICAS AND TO VENEZUELA WHERE
PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO CLAIMS A CONTROVERSIAL ELECTION VICTORY AND A THIRD TERM IN OFFICE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS YET TO RELEASE THE FULL ELECTION DATA

AND OPPOSITION IS CLAIMING THEY WANT.
DAVID NORIEGA HAS MORE.
>> Reporter: TONIGHT, OUTRAGE
ACROSS VENEZUELA AFTER PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO CLAIMS VICTORY IN HIS THIRD STRAIGHT ELECTION. THE NATIONAL ELECTORAL COUNCIL
ANNOUNCING NICOLAS MADURO SECURED 51% OF THE VOTE COMPARED TO OPPOSITION
CANDIDATE AT MUNDO GONZALES WITH 34% BUT GONZALES AND THE OPPOSITION ALSO CLAIMING
VICTORY, SAYING THEY RECEIVED 70% OF THE VOTE.
NICOLAS MADURO'S GOVERNMENT SO FAR REFUSING TO RELEASE THE DETAIL OFFICIAL RESULTS NEEDED TO BACK UP ITS CLAIM OF VICTORY. IN A STATEMENT RELEASED MONDAY, HE CLAIMED SOMEONE HACKED THE
NATIONAL ELECTORAL DATA
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. -- PROTESTERS HAVE STARTED TAKING TO THE STREETS.
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT THE PEOPLE WITHOUT ANYONE TELLING THEM TO
GET THE SUITES THEY ARE NOW IN THE SUITES. AT LEAST RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE OR BIGGER BUT SO FAR THE PEOPLE
ARE JUST SHOWING THAT THERE IS
NO CELEBRATION. >> Reporter: SEVERAL COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE U.S. ALSO CASTING
DOUBT ON THE OUTCOME AND URGING A DETAILED TABULATION OF VOTES. >> WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THE RESULT ANNOUNCED DOES NOT REFLECT THE WILL OR THE
VOTES OF THE VENEZUELAN PEOPLE. FOR MORE THAN 7 MILLION PEOPLE
HAVE LEFT VENEZUELA SINCE MADURO TOOK OFFICE. MANY NOW SAYING THEY WON'T GO
HOME. [ SPEAKING IN A GLOBAL LANGUAGE

DATES BACK TO THE TRUMP'S ADMINISTRATION. TALK TO US ABOUT WHY THE U.S. IS WATCHING THE ELECTION SO
CLOSELY. >> FOR ONE THING THERE'S THE ISSUE OF MIGRATION. THE 7+ PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT VENEZUELA IN THE LAST FEW
YEARS, 10%, 7000 PEOPLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN BORDER INTO THE U.S. BUT IN GENERAL THE U.S. IS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THIS STORY.
THE ECONOMIC CRISIS THAT PRODUCED THE MIGRATION CRISIS WAS MADE WORSE BY SANCTIONS ON VENEZUELA AND IF MADURO SERVES
ANOTHER SIX-YEAR TERM IN POWER, THOSE SAME CRISES ARE LIKELY TO INTENSIFY. THE U.S. HAS BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET MADURO OUT OF POWER. HE IS UNDER INDICTMENT IN THE
Israel vows retaliation for soccer field strike
U.S., WANTED FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING AND CORRUPTION BY U.S. FEDERAL AUTHORITIES AND HE IS NOT LIKELY TO LEAVE OFFICE PEACEFULLY UNLESS HE CAN GET SOME KIND OF GUARANTEE THAT
