>> WELL, OF COURSE, I SEE NOT
SEEN THE REPORTS. AND WHAT ALL
I CAN TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW IS
I THINK NOTHING TAKES AWAY FROM THE IMPORTANCE OF
SAID A MOMENT AGO
GETTING TO THE CEASE-FIRE, WHICH IS MANIFESTLY IN THE
INTERESTS OF
THE HOSTAGES AND BRINGING THEM HOME. IT'S MANIFESTLY IN THE
INTERESTS OF PALESTINIANS WHO ARE SUFFERING TERRIBLY EVERY
SINGLE DAY.
CHILDREN. WOMEN MET IN GAZA HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN THIS
CROSSFIRE OF HAMAS IS MAKING. IT'S PROFOUNDLY IN THE INTEREST
OF TRYING TO PUT THINGS
ON A BETTER PATH, NOT ONLY IN GAZA, BUT ACTUALLY THROUGHOUT
THE REGION BECAUSE SO MUCH IS TIED TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN
GAZA RIGHT NOW. I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE ON WHAT IMPACT ANY
ONE EVENT
MIGHT HAVE ON THAT. I'VE LEARNED
OVER MANY YEARS. NEVER REALLY SPECULATE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE
SIMPLY DON'T KNOW. WHAT I DO KNOW
IS THE ENDURING IMPERATIVE OF GETTING A CEASE-FIRE. AND WHAT
I DO KNOW IS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AT THAT EVERY DAY.
