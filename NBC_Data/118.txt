THE EXCITEMENT.
RAINING MEDALS FOR TEAM USA.
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.
I AM JOE FRYER.
>>> WE BEGIN WITH BREAKING NEWS
OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST.
THE ASSASSINATION THAT RAISES
FEARS THE REGION WILL PLUNGE
DEEPER INTO CRISIS.
OVERNIGHT, HAMAS -- WAS KILLED
BY ISRAEL AND THE STRIKE ON HIS
HOME IN TEHRAN.
ISRAEL HAS NOT YET COMMENTED ON
THE ATTACK BUT IT PREVIOUSLY
SAID IT WOULD TARGET HAMAS
LEADERS.
WHAT HAMAS AND IRAN ARE VOWING
TO RETALIATE.
ONE OF THE MAIN NEGOTIATIONS
AND THE DEAL COULD BE IN DOUBT
AFTER MEDIATOR CONDEMNED IS A
SAYING, QUOTE, UNDERMINES THE
CHANCES OF PEACE.
ON TUESDAY, ISRAEL CONFIRMED
THAT ASSASSINATED A SENIOR
HEZBOLLAH LEADER AND A STRIKE
OUTSIDE THE LEBANESE CAPITAL OF
BEIRUT.
REPORTS HER TWO CHILDREN AND I
WANTED WERE ALSO KILLED.
DOZENS WERE LEFT INJURED. THE
ATTACK WAS IN RETALIATION FOR A
STRIKE IN THE ISRAELI CONTROL
GOLAN HEIGHTS LAST WEEK.
IT KILLED 12 PEOPLE.
>>> IN A FEW MOMENTS WE WILL
SPEAK WITH OUR MILITARY ANALYSTS
BUT FIRST LET'S GET TO OUR
INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT
BRADLEY WHO JOINS US FROM
BEIRUT.
WE KNOW THE HUNT FOR HAMAS
LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR
10 MONTHS.
WALK US THROUGH HOW THIS
UNFOLDED AND THE REACTION WE
ARE GETTING FROM ACROSS THE
REGION INCLUDING IRAN WHERE
THIS HAPPENED.
>> Reporter: WE HAVE HEARD FROM
THE IRANIANS AND THEY SAID THIS
WAS A MISSILE THAT WAS FIRED
FROM SOME SORT OF AIRBORNE
ENTITY, SOME SORT OF PLANE.
OUTSIDE OF IRANIAN TERRITORY.
WHATEVER WAS CARRYING THIS
MISSILE DID NOT ENTER INTO
IRANIAN AIRSPACE. THIS IS
ACCORDING TO -- EMERALDS
RETALIATE.
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING A CHORUS
OF COMBINATIONS THROUGHOUT THE
MIDDLE EAST, CALLS FOR
ESSENTIALLY ISRAEL TO STEP BACK
BUT ALSO CAUSE FOR -- THAT IS
THIS IS AN INFLAMMATORY MOVE BY
THE ISRAELIS.
THEY HAVE SAID THEY WILL BE
HUNTING DOWN HAMAS LEADERS
WHEREVER THEY CAN FIND THEM AND
KILLING THEM.
THEY DID THE SAME THING BACK IN
BEIRUT IN JANUARY.
THERE WAS A SIMILAR ATTACK JUST
YESTERDAY THAT ASSASSINATED A
HAMAS LEADER.
AND THE ISRAELIS HAVE NOT SAID
IF THEY WERE BEHIND THAT
ASSASSINATION, A TOP OFFICIAL
IN THE CAPITAL OF IRAN, BUT
EVERYBODY IS PRETTY MUCH
ASSURED THEY HAVE DONE THIS.
THEY HAVE NOT DENIED IT AND IN
THE PAST THEY HAVE BEEN BEHIND
SEVERAL ASSASSINATIONS OF TOP
OFFICIALS AND TOP IRANIAN
OFFICIALS AND SCIENTISTS IN IRAN
WHICH IS ENTIRELY FEASIBLE.
WHETHER OR NOT THIS COMPLICATES
NEGOTIATIONS OR CREATES A
REGIONWIDE WAR, THAT IS A
CONCERN I WANT THAT AMERICAN
DIPLOMATS ARE WATCHING CLOSELY.
>> I MEAN, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
CEASE-FIRE DEAL.
THE CEASE-FIRE TALKS. HOW DOES
HIS DEATH IMPACT HOPES FOR THE
HOSTAGES?
>> Reporter: WE HEARD FROM
ANTHONY BLINKEN IN SINGAPORE
AND HE SAID HE REFUSES TO
SPECULATE ON HOW EVENTS IN
GENERAL WILL AFFECT THE FUTURE.
THAT IS A Y POSITION TO TAKE.
WE HAVE GOTTEN SOME SIGHTINGS
THAT THIS WILL COMPLICATE
THINGS.
QATAR'S PRIME MINISTER CAME OUT
AND SAID IF THE ISRAELIS ARE
BEHIND IT, HOW WAS THAT THEY
CAN NEGOTIATE WITH THE ISRAELIS
IF THE ISRAELIS ARE KILLING TOP
NEGOTIATORS?
THIS IS BECAUSE QATAR HAS BEEN
HOSTING AND MEDIATING A LOT OF
THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN HAMAS
IN ISRAEL.
SO FOR THEM, THIS IS ONE OF THE
MAIN PARTIES AND THEIR
NEGOTIATION.
HE WAS PART OF ALL OF THIS.
THIS COULD COMPLICATE THINGS
GOING FORWARD BUT THE
COMPLICATION IS WHATEVER THE
RETALIATION IS BEEN HERE AND
HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON, THEY ARE
POISED AND READY TO RESPOND TO
THAT ATTACK FROM YESTERDAY NOW
WE ARE HEARING THE IRANIANS ARE
VOWING TO RETALIATE AND HAMAS,
OF COURSE, HAS REASON TO
RETALIATE.
THIS IS THE CIRCLE CLOSING IN
ON ISRAEL AS THEY CANNOT AFFORD
TO OPEN A NEW FRONT ON THE
NORTHERN BORDER.
IN THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>> COLONEL, GOOD TO HAVE YOU
WITH US.
MANY COUNTRIES, THIS COULD BE A
DANGEROUS ESCALATION.
IT COULD JEOPARDIZE CEASE-FIRE
TALKS.
HOW DO YOU SEE THIS IMPACTING
THE WAR IN GAZA AND HOPES FOR A
PEACE DEAL?
>> THE CEASE-FIRE TALKS WILL BE
ON HOLD FOR SURE.
THEY WERE RUNNING INTO PROBLEMS
IN ANY CASE BECAUSE HAMAS WAS
BEING -- ABOUT THE TERMS BUT
NEVERTHELESS, THIS WILL SLOW OR
STOP COMPLETELY CEASE-FIRE
TALKS.
THEY WERE MEDIATED BY THE
UNITED STATES AND QATAR AND
OTHERS.
THAT WILL SLOW DOWN IF NOT
STOP.
WITH RESPECT TO HEZBOLLAH, IN
THE PAST, HEZBOLLAH'S RESPONSE
HAS BEEN TO FIRE A LARGE NUMBER
OF ROCKETS FROM LEBANON INTO
ISRAEL.
THEY DO HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF
REACHING TEL AVIV AND OTHER
CITIES.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HAS BELOW
WILL RESPOND BY FIRING ROCKETS
INTO POPULATED AREAS FARTHER
SOUTH FROM THE LEBANESE BORDER.
IF THAT HAPPENS, WE CAN EXPECT
A SERIOUS ESCALATION IN THE
CONFLICT.
ISRAEL HAS PUT ITSELF IN A
DIFFICULT POSITION BECAUSE
NETANYAHU'S STATEMENT WAS THE
OBJECTIVE WAS TO DESTROY HAMAS
AS A MILITARY ENTITY COMPLETELY.
DIFFICULT TO DO INSIDE GAZA.
EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO DO WHEN
YOU ARE THREATENED AS ISRAEL IS
BY HEZBOLLAH IN THE NORTH AND
VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH AND
OF COURSE, DANGEROUS ESCALATION
WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF
FIGHTING WITH IRAN.
>> LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED IN IRAN THAT TOOK
PLACE ON IRANIAN SOIL.
IRAN SAID IT WILL RETALIATE AND
DEFEND ITS TERRITORY INTEGRITY.
DO YOU THINK THIS COULD LEAD TO
A RESURFACING OF THE BACK-AND-
FORTH OF ATTACKS WE SAW BETWEEN
ISRAEL AND IRAN BACK IN APRIL
OR IS THIS SOMETHING BIGGER?
>> NOTHING CAN BE BIGGER THAN
WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE BECAUSE
THAT HAD THE CAPABILITY OF
ESCALATING INTO A REGIONAL
CONFLICT.
THIS WILL BE A STEP LEVEL
EFFORT WHICH MEANS WE CAN
EXPECT HEZBOLLAH WILL FIRE A
LARGE NUMBER OF ROCKETS AND HOW
ISRAEL RESPONDS, THAT WILL TELL
THE DIFFERENCE. THAT WILL SPELL
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER
OR NOT IT WILL BE AFTER THAT OR
IF THERE WILL BE A DANGEROUS
ESCALATION INCLUDING IRAN.
WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT IRAN
SUPPORTS HEZBOLLAH COMPLETELY
AND ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENS THAT HEZBOLLAH DOES
IS SUPPLIED BY, SUPPORTED BY,
IRAN.
SO, WATCH FOR ROCKETS.
IF THERE IS A SLOWER RESPONSE
FROM ISRAEL AFTER THAT, THINGS
WILL QUIET DOWN AND IT MAY VERY
WELL BE NEGOTIATIONS WILL
CONTINUE ABOUT GAZA.
BUT IF THERE -- IT IS POSSIBLE
IT COULD SPILL OVER QUICKLY AND
IF IT DOES THEN ISRAEL WILL
HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE
PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH.
DON'T FORGET, ISRAEL HAD TO
TAKE A LOT OF HIS TROOPS OUT OF
GAZA BECAUSE IT COULD NOT
AFFORD TO HAVE THEM IN UNIFORM
200 THOUSAND ISRAELIS IN
UNIFORM.
THEY CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN.
THERE WILL BE A BIG ESCALATION
PRACTICALLY IN THE NORTH.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>> LEADERS OF THE SECRET
SERVICE ARE STILL FACING TOUGH
QUESTIONS FROM LAWMAKERS ABOUT
THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD
TRUMP.

CANNOT DEFEND WHY THAT ROOF WAS

>> OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE
HAS MADE CLEAR WE BELIEVE THE
IRANIANS ARE ATTEMPTING TO KILL

THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE AND WE
HAVE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS.
I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN THE
END OF THAT.

ABOUT WHAT HE CALLED THE SCARY
INCREASE IN VIOLENT THREATS TO

CAMPAIGN EVENT AND HARRISBURG
WITH THOUSANDS EXPECTED TO
ATTEND.
THERE HAVE BEEN 18 DAYS SINCE
HE HELD A RALLY IN BUTLER RAY
GUNMAN OPENED FIRE GRAZING HIS
EAR WITH A BULLET.
ONE PERSON WAS KILLED TWO
INJURED.
NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN
COVERING THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND
JOINS US NOW WITH THE LATEST.
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT AT THE RALLY
TONIGHT?
WE KNOW THEY ARE HAPPENING

BEING INDOORS IS A SHIFT IN
MANY OF HIS RALLIES HAVE BEEN
OUTSIDE.
AND SECURITY DETAILS, THEY ARE
TRYING TO KEEP THAT CLOSE TO
THE BEST, BUT THERE WILL BE
MORE SECURITY.
GIVEN IT IS THE FIRST TIME IN
PENNSYLVANIA SINCE THE
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, I EXPECT
THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS
IT.
WE WILL ALSO BE WATCHING FOR
MESSAGING PIVOT ON VICE
PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS.
AT HIS LAST RALLY HE WAS VERY
MUCH FOCUSED ALTHOUGH HE LEFT
THE RACE BUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
IS TRYING OUT NEW ATTACK LINES
ON HARRIS AND THE BORDER AND

THESE ARE IMPORTANT POSITION
FOR THE STRATEGY AND THE
CANDIDATE.

KAMALA HARRIS.
HE IS ALSO TALKING ABOUT HIS
ROLLOUT AS MR. TRUMP'S RUNNING

UP TO HIM AND TALK TO HIM
YESTERDAY AND VANCE TOLD HIM HE
DOES NOT FEEL HE DISAPPOINTED

HE KNEW COMING OUT OF THE GATES
THERE WOULD BE SOME POSITIVE
PRESS COVERAGE AND THEN THEY
WOULD GO ON THE ATTACK.
-- OF WOMEN WHO DON'T HAVE
CHILDREN REFERRING TO THEM AS
CHILDLESS CAT LADIES.
OVER THE LAST WEEK, HARRIS'S
CAMPAIGN HAS TRIED TO QUOTE TIM
AS WEIRD BUT HE WAS ALSO ON THE
ATTACK.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> WE FACE THE WORST BORDER
CRISIS IN AMERICAN HISTORY ON
HER WATCH AND 3 1/2 YEARS, --
INVADED OUR COUNTRY.
LOYALTY IS SERVING IN THE
MARINE CORPS AND SOMETHING I
DID.

WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM VICE
PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS IS
RUNNING MATE CHOICE SOON.
TWO SOURCES TELL NBC NEWS THEY
WILL GO TO BATTLEGROUND STATES
TOGETHER BEGINNING NEXT WEEK.
>>> ON THE WEST COAST,
CALIFORNIA'S PARK FIRE GREW
OVERNIGHT AND IS NOW THE FIFTH
LARGEST WILDFIRE IN THAT
STATE'S HISTORY.
THAT MIGHT BE THE BIGGEST FIRE
BUT IT IS FAR FROM THE ONLY
ONE.
OFFICIALS ACROSS WAS REPORTED
89 LARGE ACTIVE WILDFIRES NBC
NEWS CORRESPONDENT STEVE
PATTERSON JOINS US NOW NORTH OF
SACRAMENTO WITH THE LATEST.
OVERNIGHT, THE FIRE CONTINUED
TO GROW.
HOW BIG IS IT NOW AND ARE THEY
CLOSER TO GETTING A HANDLE ON
IT
>> Reporter: THE FIRE SEEMINGLY
NEVER STOPS GROWING HERE.
MORE THAN 380,000 ACRES, IF YOU
CAN PICTURE, IT IS LARGER THAN
THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.
IT IS HALF THE SIZE OF THE
STATE OF RHODE ISLAND.
THAT ENTIRE CIRCUMFERENCE DOES
NOT LITERALLY BE ON FIRE AS WE
SPEAK FIREFIGHTERS ARE DOING A
GOOD JOB OF PUSHING IT INTO A
WORSTED AREA HOPING IT LAYS
DOWN AND BURNS OUT AND IT DIES
AWAY BUT OFFICIALS ESTIMATE
THAT COULD TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS.
SEVERAL RINGS BEFORE THAT
HAPPENS.
IN THE MEANTIME, THE MAIN
OBJECTIVE IS TO PUSH IT AWAY
CITIES AND THEY DON'T A GOOD
JOB.
18% CONTAINMENT AND THAT NUMBER
GOES UP WITH A LONG --
FIREFIGHTERS WORKING AS HARD AS
I CAN AROUND THE CLOCK TO KEEP
IT AWAY FROM WHERE PEOPLE
ACTUALLY LIVE.
MOST OF THE EVACUATION ALERTS
ARE NOW WARNINGS AND NOT ORDERS
AND EVEN SOME OF THOSE ORDERS
AND WARNINGS HAVE LIFTED SINCE
WE HAVE BEEN HERE ON THE GROUND
IT FIREFIGHTERS DOING THE BEST
THEY CAN, BUT THERE IS MORE
HOT, DRY, WINDY WEATHER IN THE
FORECAST.
WE CAN'T REACH TRIPLE DIGITS AS
EARLY AS TODAY OR TOMORROW AND
THAT COMPLICATES EVERYTHING
GOING ON HERE.
>> EVERY FIRE PRESENTS ITS OWN
CHALLENGE.
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
HERE?
AND ARE THEY HELPING RESIDENTS
EVACUATE OR IS THAT BEHIND US?
>> Reporter: THERE ARE MANY
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STILL
IMPACTED AND AFFECTED BY THE
IMMEDIATE THREAT OF FIRE.
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THEY ARE
AT A HAIR'S BREATH AT ALL-TIME.
IF THIS WERE TO EXPLODE AGAIN
IN ANOTHER DIRECTION, THAT IS
ALWAYS A DANGER AND IT'S A
DANGER EVERYWHERE WHEN YOU ARE
NEXT TO A FIRE ZONE LIKE THIS.
OTHER PLACES ARE HARDER TO DEAL
WITH THAN OTHERS, OF COURSE.
BUT FOR THE MOST PART,
FIREFIGHTERS HAVE A GOOD HANDLE
ON KEEPING IT BACK AND AWAY
FROM WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING.
THEY ARE TRYING TO DO THE BEST
THEY CAN OF THAT.
THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN THE
TERRAIN.
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE TRYING
TO PUSH IT INTO AN AREA OF
FOREST DID.
INTO AN AREA THAT HAS HILLSIDES
AND CLIFF SIDES.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE PRECISE
AIRDROPS IF YOU HAVE AN AIR
GAME, SO TO SPEAK.
IF NOT, HANG CREWS HAVE TO DO IT
IN THE NETWORK OF HILLS AND
KEEP THE FIRE CONTAIN.
THAT IS THE BIG DEAL AND THE
OTHER THING IS THE THING I
MENTIONED.
IF THIS HEATS UP AGAIN, IT IS
MISERABLE TO PUT OUT A FIRE
WHEN YOU HAVE 100 PLUS DEGREE
TEMPERATURES.
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE GOT GEAR THAT
THE GUYS ARE WEARING DOING THE
WORK.
>> THERE ARE DOZENS OF FIRES
BURNING OUT WEST RIGHT NOW.
HOW IS THAT IMPACTING THE CREWS
WHICH ARE STRETCHED US IN THIS
TIME OF YEAR?
>> Reporter: 5000 FIREFIGHTERS
ON THIS FIRE ALONE. THE
RESOURCES TO COMBAT THESE
THINGS IS ENORMOUS.
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE
WORKING 24, 36, 28 HOUR SHIFTS.
THEY ARE EXHAUSTED AND HAVE
BEEN DOING IT FOR WEEKS.
WE ARE STILL EARLY IN THE
FIREFIGHTING SEASON IT'S
UNBELIEVABLE TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE COME FALL.
IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF WORK
HERE.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR COVERAGE.
PLEASE CONTINUE TO STAY SAFE.
>>> LET'S TURN TO ANGIE LASSMAN
FOR A CHECK ON THE WEATHER.
>>> WE'VE GOT THAT HE DID TALK
ABOUT NOT JUST FOR PARTS OF THE
WEST BUT A GOOD CHUNK OF THE
COUNTRY.
WE HAVE EXPANDED ALERTS AS THE
MORNING HAS GONE ON INCLUDING
MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS LIKE
NEW YORK CITY, MIAMI, OKLAHOMA
AND OUT WEST WE HAVE SOME AND
THOSE ARE LIKELY LASTING FOR
THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE THE
GREATEST HEAT AND HUMIDITY IS
CENTERED RIGHT NOW.
SPECIFICALLY ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY.
WICHITA IS EXPECTED TO HIT 103
TODAY.
ST. LOUIS IN THE HIGH 90s BUT
FEELING LIKE 110.
CHICAGO, UPPER 80s, NOT ABOUT
ACTUAL TEMPERATURE, BUT WHAT IT
FEELS LIKE IT WILL BE CLOSER TO
THE 90s.
THE FURTHER SOUTH YOU GO,
TRIPLE DIGITS FOR WASHINGTON AND
FEELS LIKE TEMPERATURES, JUST
TODAY, WE WRAP UP JULY FEELING
LIKE SUMMER AND GO INTO AUGUST
WITH MUCH OF THE SAME.
THIS GOES OUT WEST AS WELL.
SALT LAKE CITY 99 DEGREES.
ST. LOUIS 98 DEGREES.
108 IN CHARLOTTE TOMORROW.
NEW YORK CITY LOW 90s BUT
FEELING NEAR 100 AS WE GET INTO
TOMORROW.
THIS WEEKEND, DEALING WITH THE
HEAT WAVE ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF
THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS PARTS OF
THE ROCKIES.
100 DEGREES FRIDAY AND SATURDAY
IN SALT LAKE CITY.
SIMILAR STORY FOR OKLAHOMA CITY.
INTO THE TRIPLE DIGIT FRIDAY,
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY YOU ARE
NEAR TRIPLE DIGITS.
MEMPHIS 97 AND 94 ON SATURDAY
AND SUNDAY.
WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE AS MANY
BUYER ALERTS IN PLACE RIGHT NOW
BUT THERE ARE STILL OUT THERE.
THE FIRE WEATHER WATCH BOARD
FOR PARTS OF CALIFORNIA AND
OREGON, WE HAVE ELEVATED WINDS
AND A LOW LEVEL OF HUMIDITY.
CONDITIONS AND WARM
TEMPERATURES BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR
ALERTS.
WE HAVE A LOT OF SMOKE WE ARE
DEALING WITH THE POOR AIR
QUALITY WILL BE SOMETHING THAT
STICKS WITH US TODAY LETTING
INTO THIS EVENING.
MAYBE TOMORROW.
WE WILL SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT.
YOU WILL NOTICE A BIT OF A HAZE
AND IF YOU HAVE RESPIRATORY
ISSUES
