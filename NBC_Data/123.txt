>>> WELCOME BACK.
CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR -- IS
REMOVING HOMELESS THE CABINETS
FROM ALL PUBLIC PROPERTY.
THE GOVERNOR SAYS IT'S IN THE
INTEREST OF PUBLIC HEALTH.
ADVOCATES SAY IT COULD CAUSE
MORE DAMAGE TO AN ALREADY
VULNERABLE POPULATION.
FOR NOW, LET'S GO TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE
NATIONAL COALITION OF THE
HOMELESS.
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THIS
MORNING.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
I KNOW HOMELESSNESS IN
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AN ISSUE
LAWMAKERS HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING
WITH FOR A LONG TIME.
WHAT ARE YOUR ISSUES WITH THE
-- AND WHAT HAPPENS WITH PEOPLE
WHO LIVE IN THESE ENCAMPMENT
ONCE THEY ARE RELEASED?
>> FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU FOR
HAVING ME.
AND THANK YOU FOR ADDRESSING
THIS ISSUE.
THERE ARE MANY THINGS I THINK
HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACT FOR PEOPLE
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS
BECAUSE OF THIS ORDER.
FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THAT IT
DOES NOTHING TO SOLVE
HOMELESSNESS, SAFETY ISSUES, OR
ANYTHING ELSE RELATED TO THE
PEOPLE IN THOSE ENCAMPMENTS.
WHEN YOU MOVE PEOPLE FREQUENTLY
FROM ENCAMPMENTS TO ENCAMPMENTS,
IT DOES NOT SOLVE THEIR
HOMELESS ISSUE, AND MIXED THE
HOMELESSNESS WORTH.
BUT IT MAKES THE PATH OUT OF
HOMELESSNESS HARDER.
I THINK IT'S UNDER THE BELIEF
THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE IN THESE
CONDITIONS THE -- PEOPLE ARE
FORCED INTO HOMELESSNESS.
AND THIS DID NOT ADDRESS ANY
OF THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES.
>> GOVERNOR NUISANCE AT THE
MAKESHIFT CASKET LIKE
ELECTRICITY AND RUNNING WATER,
AND THEY POSE A SAFETY AND
HEALTH HAZARD.
>> WE DO NOT WANT PEOPLE IN
SHELTERS, EITHER -- SORRY, WE
DO NOT WANT PEOPLE IN
ENCAMPMENTS EITHER.
ENCAMPMENTS ARE NOT THE ONLY
WAY FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THE
RICHEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.
PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING ON THE
GROUND.
THEY ARE SLEEPING IN TENTS.
THEY ARE NOT SAFE, THERE ARE NO
LOCKS ON THEIR DOORS.
WE ARE NOT IN ANY WAY PROMOTING
ENCAMPMENTS.
WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS, THE
SOLUTION TO REDUCING THE NUMBER
OF PEOPLE LIVING ON THE
STREETS, AND ENCAMPMENTS -- IS
TO BE A LITTLE COMPASSIONATE,
THAT INVOLVES PERMANENT
HOUSING, PARTICULARLY SHELTERS.
[ INAUDIBLE ] WHETHER IT BE A
PERMANENT HOUSING UNIT, OR
SHELTER, PRIOR TO SWEEPING THEM
AWAY.
THEM AWAY AND YOU DO NOT HAVE A
DESTINATION, THEY ARE STILL
OUTSIDE.
THEY ARE STILL HOMELESS.
IT IS NOT ADDRESS THE SAFETY
ISSUES, AND IS MUCH MORE
EXPENSIVE TO CRIMINALIZE
PEOPLE, ARREST THEM, FIND THEM
AND PUT THEM IN JAIL, THEN IT
IS TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE HOSING
-- HOUSING, -- THAT APPROACH IS
EFFECTIVE 90% OF THE TIME.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ROOT OF
THE ISSUE, WHICH IS OF COURSE
INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED.
IT IS A NUMBER OF ISSUES.
THE CALIFORNIA SENATE SAID 20%
OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION
LIVES IN THE GOLDEN STATE.
I USED TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.
I SENT WITHIN BLOCKS OF WHERE I
LIVED.
WHY IS IT SO MANY PEOPLE IN
CALIFORNIA ARE EXPERIENCING
HOMELESSNESS?
>> I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO
READ -- HOMELESSNESS IS A
HOUSING CRISIS.
THE NUMBER ONE REASON -- IT IS
VERY COMPLEX, AS YOU SAID.
BUT THE NUMBER ONE PEOPLE THAT
THE REASON PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS
IS -- HOUSING.
THEY ARE DRAMATICALLY
INCREASING HOUSING COSTS, AND
LIMITING AVAILABILITY OF OF
WHAT WILL HOUSING.
ONLY A QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE
ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING
WERE GOING TO GET SOME SUPPORT
IF THEY CANNOT ACTUALLY PAY FOR
THE HOUSING THEMSELVES.
ONLY ONE QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE ELIGIBLE ACTUALLY
RECEIVED HOUSING BECAUSE OF
LACK OF UNITS.
WE SAW 12% INCREASE IN HOUSING
AND HOMELESSNESS.
WE ALSO SIGNED 18% YEAR-OVER
YEAR INCREASE IN HOUSING COSTS.
IT'S A HOUSING ISSUE.
WE HAVE TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE
HOUSING PRODUCTION IN THIS
COUNTRY.
OR WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THIS
NUMBER RISE.
THE HOMELESS SYSTEM, IT WILL
HOUSE OVER 700 PEOPLE A YEAR,
BUT THE NEXT DAY, 700 WILL SHOW
UP.
WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE -- OR
ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
[ INAUDIBLE ] ALL OF THESE
THINGS MAKE FOR A VERY COMPLEX
ISSUE, AS YOU SAID.
AND MY SOLUTIONS ARE QUICK FIX
SOLUTIONS LIKE -- DO NOTHING
BUT MAKE THE ISSUE WORSE.
