>> SENATORS. IT'S BEEN A LONG
ROAD TO GET HERE. THE BILL
PASSED THE SENATE. HOW DO YOU FEEL? WE FEEL ENERGIZED AND
HOPEFUL AND UP TO THIS DAY THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD
WITH THIS. IT IS NICE TO HAVE 70 SENATORS.
>> THIS LEGISLATION, IT SHOWS YOU THAT THE PARENTS HAVE DONE.
>> TALKING TO THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND SAYING THIS
IS WHAT I MEAN. THAT'S
>> NOT ONLY ENERGIZE BUT REALLY INSPIRED.
THIS IS WHY WE CAME HERE TO GET THINGS DONE AND DO IT IN A
BIPARTISAN WAY THAT
LITERALLY WILL SAVE LIVES.
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS GIVING PARENTS AND KIDS THE TOOLS TO
DISCONNECT FROM HARMFUL CONTENT. WE EATING DISORDERS
STUFF THAT REALLY HURTS THEM AND ALSO IMPOSE A DUTY OF CARE
ON BIG TECH
HAS SAID TRUST US
AND BETRAYED THAT TRUST AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COMPLY
WITH THE LAW THAT IMPOSES A DUTY ON THEM TO MITIGATE OR
PREVENT HEART.
>> AND 3 AND A HALF DECADES SAYS CONGRESS PASSED ANY KIND
OF INTERNET ONLINE REGULATION. THIS TIME WE'RE TARGETING KIDS
THAT ARE GETTING TARGETED BY THE SOCIAL MEDIA. WHY HAS IT
TAKEN SO LONG TO GET TO THIS POINT?
>> YOU KNOW, 1998 WAS THE LAST BILL THAT WAS PASSED THAT DEALT
WITH PROTECTING CHILDREN FOR TO SPIKES.
WHAT THIS SHOWS YOU IS HOW THIS ARMY OF LOBBYISTS AND LAWYERS
THAT WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING NOW FOR OVER 3 YEARS HAVE POWERFUL.
THEY HAVE BEEN ON CAPITOL HILL
AND CHU
MAKE THE CASE THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE NOT THE PRODUCT
CAN BE EXPLOITED BY THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES. AND WE'VE HAD
THOUSANDS OF
KIDS AND PARENTS AND WE HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF ORGANIZATIONS
THAT HAVE AS WE DID HEARINGS. YOU KNOW, JULIE, THEY STEPPED
FORWARD. THEY TOLD THEIR STORIES THEY CAME TO US.
THEY SAID LET US BE A PART OF THIS. LET US HELP.
AND THEY HAVE PUSHED BACK.
THEY KNEW SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAND THE RESEARCH
THAT SHOWED THESE PLATFORMS KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING,
PUSHING HARMFUL CONTENT TO KIDS.
>> THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE MIKE JOHNSON TODAY SAID HE
BELIEVES IN THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL, BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DETAILS. HE TALKED TO ME ABOUT WHAT'S
NEXT FOR THIS BILL.
>> WE WILL SEND IT ACROSS TO THE HOUSE. THERE IS BROAD
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE HOUSE AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING
TO BE LOOKING TO TAKE UP TO 4.
>> WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT TIME WHEN THE HOUSE COMES
BACK TO DC AND RECONVENES. DO YOU THINK THIS WILL PASS AND
ALL THAT ATTENTION YOU? YEAH.
>> BIPARTISAN.
WE'VE DEALT WITH A LOT OF THE CHANCE TO DRAFT IT. REDRAFTED
MET WITH ADVOCATES AND ADVERSARIES.
>> AND MY MOM MET WITH THE LAWMAKERS TO YES, THEY'VE BEEN
FABULOUS. THE MOMS AND DADS AND THE KIDS HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY
WONDERFUL WORKING
AND PUSHING PAST.
>> IT'S REALLY A HUMAN STORY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS KIDS
WHERE THEY LIVE.
WHEN WE GREW UP
WAS ON THE PLAYGROUND.
KIDS CAN GO HOME, FIND A SAFE PLACE. NOW THERE ARE NO SAFE
PLACE AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE HOUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE IS
HERITAGE AND HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY HERE
AND WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING FOR 3 DECADES ABOUT TIME.
