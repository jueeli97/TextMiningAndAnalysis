DIRECT OR INDIRECT CONVERSATIONS
WITH IRAN IN THE AFTERMATH O
THE STRIKES.
JOINING ME NOW IS DEMOCRATIC
SENATOR FROM COLORADO, MICHAEL
BENNETT.
SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US
I WANT TO GETD GET YOU
REACTIONS TO THE MIDDLE EAST
HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU THAT THI
ESCALATES TENSIONS IN THE REGION
AND PUTS AN END TO THE CEASE
FIRE NEGOTIATIONS?
>> I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOU
IT
I THINK WE ALL SHOULD BE DEEPL
CONCERNED ABOUT IT
THERE IS A MOMENT IN WHICH THE
ESCALATIONS BEGIN TO FEE
POSSIBLE AND A WIDER WAR COULD
BECOME INEVITABLE.
WE HAVE TO TRY NOT TO ALLOW THAT
TO HAPPEN.
I THINK THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION
IS OBVIOUSLY DEEPLY INVOLVED I
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS HERE.
I THINK THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE TO
TRY TO PUSH EVEN WHEN TH
DOMESTIC POLITICS OF THE PARTIES
IN THE MIDDLE EAST SEEM TO B
POTENTIALLY PUSHING THEM APART
IN THE END, I THINK THE ONLY
HOPE HERE IS FOR TWO STATES THAT
ARE LIVING SIDE BY SIDE.
WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM THA
HAPPENING.
BUT I THINK THE UNITED STATE
HAS A ROLE TO PLAY TO TRY TO
KEEP IT FROM BECOMING A GREATE
REGIONAL CONFLICT.
I'M GLAD THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION FOLKS ARE TRYIN
TO DO THAT
>> YOU MET WITH SOME AMERICA
CONGRESS MEMBERS
WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM NOW?
>> WHAT THEY SAID TO ME IS THA
THEY WERE DESPERATE FOR TH
HOSTAGES TO COME HOME, THAT THEY
WANTED TO HAVE A SETTLEMENT THAT
WOULD ALLOW THE HOSTAGES TO COME
HOME
I THINK THAT IS TRUE TODAY
WE SHOULD BE PUSHING FOR THAT.
>> IF THE DEMOCRATS WIN TH
WHITE HOUSE IN NOVEMBER, WHA
ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF VICE
PRESIDENT HARRIS' FOREIG
POLICY
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HER FOREIG
POLICY RESUME?
>> I THINK WE WERE MEMBERS
TOGETHER ON THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE.
I THINK SHE HAS GOOD FOREIGN
POLICY AND THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION HAS A RECORD OF
LEADERSHIP, ESPECIALLY WIT
RESPECT TO THE MOBILIZATION OF
THE EUROPEAN NATIONS AND NATIONS
ALL AROUND THE WORLD IN TH
FIGHT AGAINST PUTIN THAT UKRAINE
HAS LED.
IT IS NOT JUST A FIGHT FOR
UKRAINE BUT A FIGHT FO
DEMOCRACY.
JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN A HUGE PART
OF THAT AND HARRIS WILL STEP
RIGHT INTO THE SHOES AS OPPOSE
TO THE RECKLESSNESS OF DONAL
TRUMP WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT AN
THE DOWN RIGHT INSANITY OF J
VANCE WHEN IT COMES TO HIS
ISOLATIONIST POSITION.
KAMALA HARRIS WOULD BE TAKING UP
A MUCH MORE NORMAL APPROACH TO
OUR FOREIGN POLICY THAN THE ON
THAT TRUMP AND VANCE WOULD B
ESPOUSING.
>> AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE
MORE ABOUT DOMESTIC POLITICS
YOU WERE ONE OF THE FIRS
DEMOCRATS TO EXPRESS CONCERN
ABOUT KEEPING PRESIDENT BIDEN ON
THE TICKET
ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THE LEVEL
OF ENTHUSIASM WE HAVE SEEN FOR
THE VP
>> WELL, I THINK IT IS
INCREDIBLE
I I THINK IT IS WONDERFUL.
I THINK JOE BIDEN'S DECISION H
MADE IS INCREDIBLY PAITIC AN
PUTS THE COUNTRY AHEAD OF JO
BIDEN.
NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE
NEXT FOUR MONTHS COUNT
SO IT IS DEBATABLE
WE HAVE TO SHOW UP BETWEEN NOW
AND ELECTION DAY AND MAKE SURE
WE ELECT A DEMOCRAT WHITE HOUSE,
SENATE AND HOUSE
IT WILL NOT HAPPEN BY ITSELF
WE WILL HAVE TO KNOCK ON DOORS
AND GET PEOPLE OUT AND MAKE SURE
THEY UNDERSTAND THE STAKES
WHEN YOU SEE A FORMER PRESIDEN
OF THE UNITED STATES DO WHAT
THIS PRESIDENT DID IN CHICAGO,
IF PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE A REASON
TO MAKE SURE WE ARE IN THE
ELECTION, YOU NOW UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES REALLY
ARE.
>> SENATOR, YOU MENTIONED TH
IMPACT ON DOWN BALLOT RACES.
WHAT RACE SPECIFICALLY DO YO
THINK SHE WILL IMPACT?
>> I THINK SHE ALREADY HAS
I CONCERNS ARTICULATED EARLY O
IS THAT I THOUGHT WE WOULD B
WIPED OUT IN THE HOUSE AND
SENATE
EVEN TODAY, OUR ODDS OF WINNIN
THE HOUSE ARE VASTLY IMPROVE
BEFORE THE VICE PRESIDENT TOOK
UP THE MANTLE.
AND I THINK OUR ODDS IN TH
SENATE TODAY ARE MUCH HIGHER
THAN THEY WERE BEFORE.
PART OF THAT IS THE GENERATIONAL
DIFFERENCE THAT THE VICE
PRESIDENT REPRESENTS
AND A HUGE PART OF IT IS THE
EXCITEMENT ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE,
ALL OVER COLORADO, ALL OVER THIS
COUNTRY WHO FEEL LIKE THEY NOW
HAVE A REASON TO VOTE.
I THINK THEY HAD A REASON TO
VOTE BEFORE.
BUT THAT IS NOT AS IMPORTANT
NOW THEY FEEL THEY HAVE A REASON
TO VOTE.
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE EVERYON
DOES VOTE.
>> AND THE CAMPAIGN SAYS SHE
WILL BE OUT IN BATTLEGROUN
STATES WITH HER VP PICK NEXT
WEEK
YOU TOLD US THAT SHE IS THE BEST
CHOICE
>> WELL, I STILL LOVE MARK
KELLY, I THINK SHE WILL MAKE A
EXCELLENT CHOICE AND SHE DOESN'T
NEED ME TO INTERFERE WITH THAT
DECISION
>> WITH REGARDS TO MARK KELLY,
TRUMP HAS GONE ALL IN ATTACKIN
HER RECORD ON THE BORDER
YESTERDAY AT A RALLY IN ATLANTA,
THE VICE PRESIDENT CAME OU
EARLY TRYING TO COUNTER TH
NARRATIVE.
CAN HE HELP ON THAT ISSUE?
>> I THINK HE CAN HELP A LOT O
THAT ISSUE
HE IS OBVIOUSLY FROM A BORDE
STATE.
BUT LISTEN, THE REALITY IS THE
REPUBLICANS WALKED AWAY FROM THE
IMMIGRATION BILL BECAUSE DONAL
TRUMP WANTED TO KEEP IT AS A
CAMPAIGN ISSUE
THAT IS NO SECRET TO EVERYONE.
WHAT IS LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME.
WE STARTED WITH A GANG OF TEN,
WHO WROTE THE LAST COMPREHENSIVE
IMMIGRATION BILL WITH 68 VOTES
AND WHO KILLED IT?
THE FREEDOM CAUCUS IN THE HOUS
KILLED IT.
THEY DON'T WANT TO SOLVE THE
ISSUE.
THEY JUST WANT TO CAMPAIGN O
THE ISSUE, WHETHER IT IS 8 YEARS
AGO, 10 YEARS AGO, WHEN WE WER
NEGOTIATING OVER UKRAINE AID
THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO DEAL WITH
THIS AND WE NEED TO DEAL WIT
THIS LIKE PASSING CITIZENSHI
FOR 11 MILLION PEOPLE, THE DREAM
ACT AND VISA BILLS THAT ARE SO
IMPORTANT TO OUR AGRICULTURA
SECTOR
AND I THINK THAT WE CAN DO IT,
YOU KNOW
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WITH TH
RIGHT LEADERSHIP IN WA
