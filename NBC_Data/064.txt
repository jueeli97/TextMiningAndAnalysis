>>> GOOD MORNING.
WE BEGIN THIS MORNING WITH A
TIGHT RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
WHICH IS NOW LESS THAN 100 DAYS
AWAY.
RECENT POLLS SHOW FORMER
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND VICE
PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS
APPROACHING A DEAD HEAT IN
MULTIPLE BATTLEGROUND STATES.
THOSE POLLS LEAVING TRUMP'S
SHARPENING HIS ATTACKS.
FIRST, AT THE COIN CONFERENCE
IN NASHVILLE, HE DISMISSED THE
SURGE IN THE PULSE OF THE
HONEYMOON PHASE.
>> WE HAVE COUNTRY TO RUN.
THE PROBLEM IS, LAW IS WORSE
THAN JOE.
SHE IS A RADICAL LEFT LUNATIC.
>> TRUMP AND HIS RUNNING MATE
JD VANCE HAD A RALLY IN
MINNESOTA WHERE HARRIS HAS THE
BIGGEST LEAD THAT NOMINEE SPENT
A LARGE PART OF HIS ATTACKS AT
PRESIDENT BIDEN.
MEANWHILE, HARRIS'S CAMPAIGN
EARNED MORE THAN $1 MILLION
ADDING TO HER MASSIVE $200
MILLION FUND-RAISING TOTAL JUST
ONE WEEK INTO THE RACE.
WE HAVE A TEAM JOINING US THIS
MORNING TO BREAK DOWN THE
LATEST INCLUDING NBC NEWS
POLITICAL REPORTER JOHN ALLEN
AND SENIOR WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT GABE GUTIERREZ.
GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
JOHN, I WANT TO START WITH YOU.
MINNESOTA IS THE ONE STATE
WHERE VP HARRIS IS MEETING
TRUMP.
SO, WHY IS HE FOCUSING HIS TIME
AND ENERGY THERE?
WE ARE STILL SEEING ATTACKS AT
BIDEN.
>> THE REASON IS THERE HAVE
BEEN POLLING OVER THE COURSE OF
THE CAMPAIGN AND CERTAINLY, IN
THE LAST WEEKS OF THE BUYING
CAMPAIGN BEFORE WE GOT A HARRIS
CAMPAIGN, THE NUMBERS ACCORDING
TO INDEPENDENT POLLSTERS CLOSE
SIGNIFICANTLY.
THERE WAS A PLAN TO GO TO
MINNESOTA, I STATE THAT IS
GOING TO BE A BATTLEGROUND AND
FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT PLAN.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH
POLLING.
WE ARE STILL EARLY IN THE STATE
OF A NEW CAMPAIGN OF HARRIS
VERSUS TRUMP AS OPPOSED TO
BIDEN VERSUS TRUMP.
>> WHAT A DIFFERENCE A WEEK
MAKES.
THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN SEEMS TO
HAVE A SUCCESSFUL TURNOUT THIS
WEEKEND.
THEY ARE TRYING TO WIND GEN Z
SUPPORT.
WALK US THROUGH WHAT SHE HAD TO
SAY ABOUT HER MESSAGES TO THAT
GROUP OF YOUNGER VOTERS?
>> IT IS NO SECRET THAT
PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD A DIFFICULT
TIME WITH YOUNG VOTERS AND VP
HARRIS IS TRYING TO LEAD INTO
THAT.
THE PAST COUPLE DAYS, SHE HAS
TAKEN MORE DIRECT ATTACKS ON
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
AND HIS RUNNING MATE JD VANCE
REFERRING TO THEM AS WEIRD AND
ALSO ATTACKING THE COMMENTS
FROM 2021 WERE JD VANCE REFER
TO SOME DEMOCRATS AS, QUOTE
CHILDLESS CAT LADIES.
BUT THE VICE PRESIDENT AND HER
TEAM ARE LEANING INTO SOCIAL
MEDIA TRYING TO WIN OVER THE
GEN Z VOTERS.
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF MEANS
AND THEY ARE LEANING INTO THAT
HOPING IT MIGHT CONVINCE SOME
OF THESE YOUNGER VOTERS TO GO
TO THE POLLS AND, AS OF NOW,
HER MAIN MESSAGE HAS BEEN THAT
YOUNG VOTERS DELIVER THE 2020
ELECTION TO JOE BIDEN AND SHE
IS TRYING TO GET THAT SAME TYPE
OF BEEN LOUISIANA THEM THIS
NOVEMBER.
>> THEY TOLD ME THIS IS JUST
THE BEGINNING.
THE POLLS MERELY TRUMPED UP HER
POLICIES ARE LARGELY THE SAME AS
BIDEN'S.
WHAT IS PLAYING VOTERS'
OPINIONS.
>> RIGHT OFF THE BAT, YOU HAVE
A CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN WHO WAS
STRUGGLING SO MUCH THAT HE
CHOSE NOT TO SEEK RE-ELECTION.
HERE'S A GUY THAT WAS RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT HIS ENTIRE ADULT
LIFE AND WHO EVENTUALLY
REALIZED THERE WAS NOT A PATH
TO VICTORY.
THE REASON WHY DEMOCRATIC
VOTERS WERE NOT EXCITED ABOUT
HIM COMING INDEPENDENT VOTERS
WERE WORRIED ABOUT IT AND THEY
THOUGHT HE SHOULD NOT BE IN
OFFICE NOW BASED ON HIS
APPARENT DECLINE.
SO, REPLACE THEM WITH SOLID --
SOMEBODY WITH ENTHUSIASM AND
AND NOT STUMBLING IN PUBLIC
APPEARANCES, I THINK THAT IN
AND OF ITSELF IS A BIG REASON
FOR WHY YOU SEE A CHANGE SO
QUICKLY.
THE OTHER THING IS, KAMALA
HARRIS IS SOMEBODY THAT
DEMOCRATS ARE EXCITED ABOUT.
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN PUNCH
THE TICKET OR PULL THE LEVER IN
THE BALLOT BOX FOR HER.
AGAIN, WE ARE STILL EARLY AND
HAVE NOT EVEN HIT LABOR DAY
YET.
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS A 180
ON THE ENERGY BEHIND ITS CANOPY
>> AT BACK TO PRESIDENT BIDEN.
HE IS HEADED TO TEXAS TODAY.
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?
>> THIS IS A TRIP THAT WHISKEY
RESCHEDULED FOLLOWING --
RESCHEDULED FOLLOWING THE
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON DONALD
TRUMP.
-- IN TEXAS BUT THIS MORNING,
HE HAS PUBLISHED AN OP-ED IN
THE WASHINGTON POST AND WE
EXPECT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS
THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHERE HE IS
PROPOSING SEVERAL SUPREME COURT
REFORMS.
A MESSAGE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE
HAS BEEN TOUTING OVER THE LAST
SEVERAL WEEKS.
AMONG THOSE REFORMS INCLUDES
TERM LIMITS, AND ALSO A BINDING
CODE OF ETHICS FOR THE SUPREME
COURT.
THIS COMES AFTER THE SUPREME
COURT RENDERED THAT DECISION ON
PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY SEVERAL
MONTHS AGO AND THE PRESIDENT
HAS REALLY FOCUSED IN ON THIS
MESSAGE FOR EMILY, IT IS
UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT THAT
THERE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED
HOUSE BUT THIS IS A WINNING
MESSAGE COME NOVEMBER.
>> BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, JOHN,
VP HARRIS HAS YET TO ANNOUNCE A
RUNNING ME.
DO YOU BELIEVE SHE IS CLOSER TO
A DECISION?
WHEN DO YOU THINK IT WILL, AND
WHO DO YOU THINK THE FAVORITES
ARE AT THIS POINT?
>> THERE IS WORK THAT SIMONE
BILES IS TOO YOUNG TO BE VICE
PRESIDENT.
AND MOST OF THE OLYMPIC ATHLETE
ARE.
WE HAVE SEEN A WHOLE GROUP OF
GOVERNORS AND ONE SENATOR, MARK
KELLY FROM ARIZONA, AND
GOVERNOR COOPER FROM NORTH
CAROLINA AND SHAPIRO FROM
PENNSYLVANIA AND BASHIR FROM
KENTUCKY.
I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL,
AND MY SOURCES HAVE NOT TOLD ME
WHO THEY THINK IT WILL BE, OR
AT LEAST WHO THEY KNOW IT WILL
BE, BUT WE WILL FIND OUT WITH
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
>> DOESN'T WANT SIMONE BILES?
RIGHT?
THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME.
>>> LEADERS ARE URGING
RESTRAINT AS ISRAEL DECIDES HOW
IT WILL RESPOND TO A ROCKET
STRIKE THAT KILLED 12 YOUNG
PEOPLE THANK GOLAN HEIGHTS.
ISRAEL HAS BOUGHT FOR THE
ATTACK AND IS VOWING TO RESPOND
BUT THE GROUP HAD DENY
RESPONSIBILITY.
THE VICTIMS WERE FROM A
COMMUNITY THAT PRACTICES AN
OFFSHOOT OF ISLAM AND MORE THAN
20,000 ALSO LIVED AND THE
OCCUPIED GOLAN HEIGHTS.
OUR CORRESPONDENT JOINS US NOW.
LAST NIGHT, ISRAEL SAID IT
WOULD DECIDE ON THE, QUOTE,
MANNER AND TIMING OF THE
RESPONSE, BUT WE HAVE ALREADY
SEEN SOME ATTACKS ON LEBANON.
WHAT THE LATEST?
>> THERE WAS A DRONE STRIKE
OUTSIDE OF TOWN THIS MORNING
AND TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND
THREE INJURED.
SATURDAY'S ROCKET ATTACK ON THE
SOCCER FIELD SET UP A SERIES OF
RETALIATORY STRIKES AND THE
DEFENSE FORCES SAID THEY HIT
SEVEN TARGETS DEEP INSIDE
LEBANESE TERRITORY.
HEZBOLLAH SAYS IT HIT HIS
REALITY -- IN RESPONSE TO THE
NME'S AGGRESSION.
ALL OF THIS AFTER THAT STRIKE
ON THE SOCCER FIELD SATURDAY
EVENING.
THERE IS A BOMB SHELTER A FEW
YARDS FROM THE SOCCER FIELD AND
RESIDENTS SAID THERE WAS NO
TIME TO REACH IT BECAUSE THE
SIREN SOUNDED JUST MOMENTS
BEFORE THE BLAST.
ISRAEL SAYS AT LEAST A DOZEN
CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS WERE
KILLED IN THE BLAST AND BLINKED
HAD BEFORE.
CLAIMING ROCKET FRAGMENTS ON
SITE ARE FROM A TYPE ONLY USED
BY HEZBOLLAH.
HABILIS SAYS IT WAS FIRING
ROCKETS AT ISRAEL SATURDAY BUT
DENIED INVOLVEMENT IN THAT
STRIKE.
>> TALK TO US ABOUT THE
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS WE HAVE BEEN
FROM THE U.S. TO TRY AND STOP
THE CONFLICT FROM BROADENING TO
LEBANON.
>> MANY WORLD LEADERS URGING,
RIGHT NOW.
SECRETARY OF STATE BLINKEN
AMONG THEM.
HE SAID THERE WAS EVERY
INDICATION THAT THE ROCKETS
THAT HIT THE SOCCER FIELD OR
FROM HEZBOLLAH AND HE SAID HE
WAS DEEPLY SADDENED BY THE LOSS
OF LIFE BUT URGING RESTRAINT.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH
THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL.
AND, GAIN, I EMPHASIZED IT IS
RIGHT TO DEFEND ITS CITIZENS
AND OUR DETERMINATION TO MAKE
SURE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THAT,
BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO SEE
THE CONFLICT ESCALATE OR
SPREAD.
>> THAT IS A REAL RISK.
IT IS A RISK ALL ALONG, EVER
SINCE THE ATTACKS ON OCTOBER
7th.
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, HE IS
VOWING TO STRIKE BACK USING
VERY FIRM LANGUAGE AND SAID
HEZBOLLAH WOULD PAY A HEAVY
PRICE, HEAVIER THAN BEFORE.
HE MET WITH HIS POLITICAL
SECURITY CABINET ON SUNDAY
RUSHING BACK FROM WASHINGTON,
D.C., AND LEAVING A FEW HOURS
EARLY, IN FACT, TO MEET WITH
TOP SECURITY OFFICIALS.
THE RISK OF ESCALATION IS A
REAL WORRY FOR PEOPLE AROUND
THE WORLD.
FOR LEADERS IN THE U.S. AS
WELL.
IT IS RISING TODAY AND THE IDF
IS WARNING OVER THE WEEKEND
THAT THEY ARE ON THE BRINK OF
AN ALL-OUT WAR AGAINST
HEZBOLLAH.
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT
LEADERS IN THE U.S. AND
ELSEWHERE HAVE BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT AND THE KIND OF THING,
ONCE AGAIN, THEY ARE TRYING
DESPERATELY TO PREVENT THIS
MORNING.
>> KELLY, THERE WAS ALSO A
DEADLY WEEKEND IN GAZA.
THEY CAPTURED THE AFTERMATH OF
THE ISRAELI AIR STRIKE ON A
SCHOOL.
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING ABOUT
THAT?
>> YES, THE WAR OBVIOUSLY
CONTINUES AND AND AIR STRIKE
HIT A SCHOOL IN CENTRAL GAZA
BEING USED AS A SHELTER BY
DISPLACED PEOPLE.
THE AFTERMATH CAUGHT ON CAMERA
BY OUR NEWS TEAM.
VERY SAD IMAGES OF PARENTS
LOOKING FOR THEIR CHILDREN,
DISTRAUGHT CHILDREN, A LOT OF
DEBRIS AND A LOT OF DISTURBING
IMAGES.
AT LEAST 30 PEOPLE WERE KILLED
ACCORDING TO GAZA HEALTH
OFFICIALS ISRAEL FOR ITS PART
SAID THEY WERE TARGETING HAMAS
COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTER USED
TO STORE WEAPONS AND PLAN
ATTACKS.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL
THE DETAILS FOR
>>> THIS MORNING, FIREFIGHTERS
IN CALIFORNIA ARE TRYING TO GET
A HANDLE ON ONE OF THE LARGEST
WILDFIRES IN THE STATE'S
HISTORY.
IT IS CHARRED MORE THAN 360,000
ACRES TO AND DESTROYED DOZENS
OF STRUCTURES AND IS SO BIG YOU
CAN SEE IT FROM SPACE.
OUR CORRESPONDENT D PATTERSON
IS IN CHICO, CALIFORNIA, WITH
THE LATEST.
>> Reporter: THIS STARTED AS A
SMALL BRUSH FIRE A FEW DAYS
AGO.
WE WATCHED A ROPE FROM 50,000
ACRES TO 160,000 ACRES AND NOW
THERE IS MORE THAN 360,000
ACRES, AND IS THE SEVENTH
LARGEST FIRE AND CALIFORNIA AND
THE LARGEST ACTIVE FIRE BURNING
NOW.
IT HAS DISPLACED THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT
HAD TO BE EVACUATED YEARS AGO
FOR THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE
WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY
OF, THE CAMP FIRE.
THE FIRE IS ALSO BEING
INVESTIGATED AS A ARSON. ALL OF
THIS WHILE THE FIRE CONTINUES
ITS RAPID EXPANSION AND GROWING
SO BIG SO FAST ON ALL FRONTS
THAT THE PRIMARY OPERATION
RIGHT NOW IS JUST SLOWING IT
DOWN.
THANKFULLY, THE WEATHER IS
COOPERATING.
IT IS A LOT COLDER THAN IT HAD
BEEN AND FIREFIGHTERS CAN GET
SOME CONTAINMENT ON IT.
WE ARE UP TO 12%, BUT THE FEAR
IS THAT THE LARGEST FIRE
CURRENTLY BURNING WILL ONLY GET
LARGER.
THERE IS FRESH BONE DRY FUEL
AND THE RIGHT IS THIS COULD
LAST FOR MONTHS.
BACK TO YOU.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

ONE OF THOSE EVENTS YOU DON'T

WHEN IT COMES TO FOIL FENCING
