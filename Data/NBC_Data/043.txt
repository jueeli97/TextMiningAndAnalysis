>>> EARLIER TODAY, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WELCOMED ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU AT MAR-A-LAGO.
A CONTRAST WITH THE MEETINGS NETANYAHU HAD AT THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY. AND ALL OF THEM HIGHLY
CONSEQUENTIAL. I AM ERIN McLAUGHLIN IN FOR GADI SCHWARTZ, AND THIS IS "STAY TUNED NOW."
♪
Trump and Netanyahu hold meeting
>>> TRUMP AND NETANYAHU'S MEETING TODAY, APPARENTLY A GOOD ONE. ACCORDING TO THE FORMER
PRESIDENT. IT WAS THE LAST STOP ON THE PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO THE U.S. AND COMES ON THE HEELS OF TWO BIG MEETINGS WITH PRESIDENT
BIDEN, AND ONE WITH PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE VICE PRESIDENT, KAMALA HARRIS .
>> CLOSER TO A CEASE-FIRE DEAL? >> I HOPE SO, BUT I THINK TIME WILL TELL. AND WE ARE WORKING
ON IT. >> HARRIS SHARED SHARP CRITICISM ABOUT THE WAR IN GAZA
FOLLOWING HER MEETING WITH NETANYAHU, YESTERDAY, ESTABLISHING HER OWN POSITION ON THE WAR SINCE ANNOUNCING HER CANDIDACY.
>> WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN GAZA OVER THE PAST NINE MONTHS IS DEVASTATING.
THE IMAGES OF DEAD CHILDREN, WE CANNOT LOOK AWAY IN THE FACE OF THESE TRAGEDIES. WE CANNOT ALLOW OURSELVES TO BECOME NUMB TO THE SUFFERING,
AND I WILL NOT BE SILENT. >> NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT,
JESSE KIRSCH, JOINS US NOW. HOW DO YOU COMPARE THE VISIT AT
MAR-A-LAGO VERSUS THE WHITE HOUSE? >> Reporter: YES, ERIN, I
THINK ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES IS THE EMPHASIS POINT, WE HEARD FROM VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS IS
SPEAKING NOT JUST ABOUT ISRAELI INTERESTS, BUT ALSO ABOUT CONCERNS FOR HOW PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE ARE BEING TREATED IN GAZA . CONTRAST THAT WITH THE MEETING TODAY BETWEEN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRIME
MINISTER NETANYAHU THAT WAS EMPHASIZING ISRAELI INTERESTS. I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY
DIFFERENTIATING POINTS. SOMETHING ELSE OF NOTE THIS WAS
THE FIRST TIME THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND PRIME MINISTER HAVE MET IN PERSON SINCE MR. TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU REMEMBER THERE WAS A
FALLING OUT IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 2020 ELECTION. THIS WAS ALSO A BIT OF A MOMENT OF COMING BACK TOGETHER IT SEEMS, EMBRACES AND SMILES WHEN
THEY MET WITH EACH OTHER TODAY. >> ON THAT NOTE, TRUMP AND NETANYAHU WERE ON GOOD TERMS,
BUT SOME PEOPLE MAY RECALL AS YOU ARE SAYING IT REALLY DID NOT END ON THE STRONGEST TERMS.
SO TALK TO ME A BIT ABOUT THAT. HOW DID IT PLAY OUT TODAY?
>> Reporter: YEAH, WE HEARD PUSHBACK FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT. HERE'S PART OF WHAT HE SAID.
>> NO PRESIDENT HAS DONE WHAT
I'VE DONE FOR ISRAEL, AND WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP, AND I HAVE A
SECRET WEAPON. AS LONG AS I HAVE SARAH--
>> [ LAUGHTER ] >> Reporter: FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP REFERRING TO THE PRIME
MINISTER'S WIFE, THEY ARE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR EVEN GOING BACK TO LAST FALL AS THE WAR
BEGAN BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD CRITICISM TO SHARE AS FAR AS
MR. NETANYAHU'S POLICIES AND HOW HE'S CARRYING OUT THE WAR. >> AND JESSE, TELL US WHERE
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING THERE TONIGHT? >> Reporter: A TURNING POINT
CONFERENCE, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON FAITH LEADERS, AND WE WILL HEAR FROM FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND THIS BEING
A FAITH CONFERENCE WE WILL SEE HOW HE MIGHT SPEAK TO HIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE ATTEMPTED
ASSASSINATION AND MAYBE THE CALLS WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME PEOPLE, HIS SUPPORTERS ABOUT HIM
POTENTIALLY BEING SAVED BY GOD, THAT'S ONE OF THE LINES WE'VE HEARD IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT SHOOTING. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
FBI confirms Trump was hit by bullet
HOW HE MIGHT LEAN INTO THAT. >> JESSE KIRSCH, THANK YOU FOR
THAT REPORTING. >>> BREAKING NEWS TONIGHT, THE FBI HAS CONFIRMED THE BULLET DID STRIKE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP YEAR DURING THAT
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT. EARLIER THIS WEEK DIRECTOR FOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS, SAYING THERE WAS "SOME QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A BULLET OR
SHRAPNEL THAT HIT THE FORMER PRESIDENT. BUT OFFICIALS ARE NOT CONFIRMING THAT TRUMP WAS DEFINITELY HIT BY A BULLET.

>>> MEANWHILE HARRIS WAS ENDORSED BY TWO OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL DEMOCRATS, BARACK
OBAMA, AND MICHELLE OBAMA. >> TO MY GIRL, KAMALA, THIS IS
GOING TO BE HISTORIC. >> MICHELLE AND I COULDN'T BE
MORE PROUD TO ENDORSE YOU, TO GET EVERYTHING TO THIS
ELECTION. >> HER CAMPAIGN, KICKING OFF HER CANDIDACY WITH WHAT THEY CALL THE WEEKEND OF ACTION,
HOLDING OVER 50 EVENTS IN THE STATE OF NEVADA, ALONE. NBC NEWS WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENT ALI RAFFA JOINS US NOW. THIS IS AN ENDORSEMENT THAT IS
SIGNIFICANT FROM THE OBAMA'S.
>> Reporter: YEAH, ERIN, IT WASN'T SURPRISING THAT THIS ENDORSEMENT CAME, BUT IT CANNOT
BE UNDERSCORED HOW CRITICAL IT IS FOR THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN AS IT TRIES TO BUILD MOMENTUM FROM THE LAST FIVE DAYS AND CONTINUE THAT MOMENTUM OVER THE NEXT 102
DAYS UNTIL ELECTION DAY. SOURCES FAMILIAR SAY WHILE FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS OVER THE LAST WEEK, HE
HELD OFF ON MAKING THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WHEN HE DID FOR A
COUPLE REASONS. HE DID NOT WANT IT FIRST OF ALL TO OVERSHADOW THE BIG OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS THE PRESIDENT AVON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHERE HE EXPLAINED TO THE NATION WHY HE
WAS DROPPING OUT OF THE 2024 RACE. HE WANTED IT TO STAND ON
ITS OWN, NOT THAT HE WAS GOING TO PUT THE SCALE MORE WEIGHT ON
THE SCALE. AS FAR AS WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE NEXT WE ARE TOLD THEY
ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE SCHEDULING AND LOGISTICS OF WHEN THEY COULD APPEAR ON THE
CAMPAIGN TRAIL TOGETHER. WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL DATE ON THE CALENDAR JUST YET, BUT YOU THINK OF HOW MUCH MORE VISIBLE AND HOW MUCH MORE OF A ROLE
FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS PLAYING IN THE BIDING CAMPAIGN
IN RECENT MONTHS, THINK OF HOW MUCH MORE INVOLVED HE WOULD BE OVER THE NEXT 100 OR SO DAYS FOR THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN.
>> YEAH, WE SPOKE WITH JESSE ON HARRIS' WORDS ON THE WAR IN
GAZA. HOW DOES THIS COMPARE? >> Reporter: THERE WAS A LOT OF
ATTENTION ON SPECIFICALLY HER MEETING WITH ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU YESTERDAY AND WHETHER THERE WOULD BE ANY DAYLIGHT BETWEEN
HER STANCE ON THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR WHERE THE PRESIDENT SEEMED
TO STAND ON THAT WERE SENT TO BEGAN, AND WE REALLY SAW HER AND NOT THE PRESIDENT COME OUT AND DELIVER THESE SOLAR REMARKS AFTER HER MEETING REALLY PUT TO
BED ANY SUSPICIONS THAT THE TWO
WERE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE. WE HEARD HER ECHO WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS CONTINUING TO DEFEND ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO
DEFEND ITSELF WHILE STILL EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN SITUATION IN GAZA, AND ADDING PRESSURE ON NETANYAHU TO AGREE TO THAT HOSTAGE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD END
THIS WAR AND SO WHAT WE ARE SEEING FROM HARRIS AFTER THAT MEETING WAS REALLY A PERSONAL
SPEECH. SHE DELIVERED REMARKS THAT HAD A PERSONAL TOUCH TO IT.
THE SAME MESSAGE AND OPINION AS THE PRESIDENT, BUT A DIFFERENT
DELIVERY, ERIN. >> HARRIS WAS ENDORSED BY A LARGE TRADE UNION AFTER
GOVERNOR JOSH SCHAPIRO GAVE HIS OWN ENDORSEMENT.
HE IS POTENTIALLY ON A SHORT LIST OF RUNNING MATES. HOW ARE THE VEEP-STAKES GOING?
>> Reporter: WE ARE TOLD FROM SOURCES FAMILIAR THERE WAS A
STAFF CALL AROUND A DOZEN POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. THEY BEGAN, ON TUESDAY, A
HARRIS CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON SAID IN A STATEMENT IN PART "WE
DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL UPDATES UNTIL THE VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES WHO WILL BE SERVING AS HER RUNNING
MATE AND AS THE NEXT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE EXPECT THAT DECISION TO BE MADE BEFORE AUGUST 7th,
DEADLINE SET BY THE DNC TO GET HARRIS AND THAT RUNNING MATE ON BALLOTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND THE HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS VOWING TO STICK TO THAT TIMELINE.
MOST CANDIDATES ARE DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNORS THAT WOULD HELP HARRIS WIN IN NOVEMBER, AND HARRIS IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO BE RECEPTIVE TO THESE
California park wildfire doubles in size
RUNNING MATES, HAVING BEEN IN THIS POSITION HERSELF A FEW YEARS AGO. >> ALI RAFFA , THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR THAT REPORTING. >>> BREAKING NEWS ON THE WEST COAST TONIGHT IN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES ARE EXPLODING OUT OF CONTROL.
>> THE STATE'S LARGEST FIRE DOUBLED IN SIZE OVER THE LAST
48 HOURS DESTROYING SEVERAL BUILDINGS AND HOMES. THE SO-CALLED PARK FIRE IS
BURNING, NEAR CHICO. FIREFIGHTERS THERE ARE MAKING LITTLE PROGRESS SO FAR.
MEANWHILE IN OREGON, THE FAA IS NOW CONFIRMING THE PILOT OF AN AIR TANKER DIED WHILE HELPING
FIGHT WILDFIRES IN THE EASTERN HEART OF THAT STATE. THE PLANE DISAPPEARED WHILE FIGHTING THE FIRE LAST NIGHT.
DAVID NORIEGA, HOW BETTER
CONDITIONS RIGHT TO MARK >> Reporter: CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED A LITTLE BIT.
YESTERDAY THEY WERE TERRIBLE, WINDS, LIGHTNING STORMS, TODAY, TEMPERATURES COOLED A LITTLE BIT. THE WINDS SLOWED DOWN, AND THERE IS BEEN TIME FOR CREWS TO
MAKE PROGRESS. YESTERDAY THE DURKEE FIRE, THE BIGGEST IN THE COUNTRY RIGHT
NOW, 0% CONTAINMENT YESTERDAY, TODAY, 55% CONTAINMENT.
THERE WAS A PLANE WHERE A PILOT CRASHED, THAT IS ABOUT 22%
CONTAINED, AND THAT WAS THE ONLY FATALITY. EXPERTS CAUTION THE FIRES ARE STILL THERE HUGE AND
UNPREDICTABLE, ERIN. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS, ARE THEY MAKING PROGRESS IN COMPANY?
>> IN CALIFORNIA IT IS THE OPPOSITE STORY UNFORTUNATELY. CONDITIONS AROUND THE PARK
FIREWORK OPTIMAL, HIGH WINDS, HOT TEMPERATURES, DRY VEGETATION, RUGGED TERRAIN.
EXPERTS DESCRIBE THE BEHAVIOR
AS EXTREME WITH A LOT OF SPOT FIRES, EMBERS FLYING OUT OF THE PERIMETER AND RAPIDLY GROWING THE PERIMETER OF THE FIRE. CAL FIRE HAD THE FIRE AT 3%
CONTAINMENT, IT HAS DECREASED TO 0% WHERE IT REMAINS NOW.
IT IS MAINLY BURNING AWAY FROM CHICO, ALLEGEDLY STARTED BY
ARSON, BUT IT IS WORSENING TO APPROACH OTHER SETTLEMENTS THAT
HAS DESTROYED ABOUT 134 STRUCTURES SO FOR BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL.
SO WE WILL BE LOOKING BETWEEN TODAY AND TOMORROW FOR HOPEFULLY SOME CONDITIONS TO
IMPROVE AND ALLOW CREWS TO START MAKING PROGRESS IN CONTAINING THAT FIRE, ERIN . >> DAVID NORIEGA, THANK YOU.
ANGIE GLASSMAN IS TRACKING WESTERN CONDITIONS INTO THE WEEKEND.

THOSE WILL REMAIN. WE STILL HAVE HOT AND WINDY CONDITIONS ON TAP AND THE POTENTIAL FOR DRY THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN AS WE GET INTO
TOMORROW. NOTICE THE FIRE WEATHER AREAS WE ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT. SOME OF THE SIMILAR SPOTS WHERE
FIRES CONTINUE TO BURN, WE WILL SEE THIS LAST INTO TOMORROW.
TOP OF THAT NOT A LOT OF RAIN IN THE FORECAST, AND WE EVEN HAVE SMOKE ON THE MOVE. THIS WILL BE SOMETHING WE SEE
THROUGH THE DAY TODAY INTO THE REST OF THE DAY TOMORROW. WORKING TO PARTS OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS. NOTICE THESE FIRES THAT ARE CURRENTLY
BURNING.
THE UPPER LEVEL WINDS WILL WORK MUCH OF THIS INTO PARTS OF THE MIDWEST. NOTICE A LITTLE BIT OF HAZE AND UNFORTUNATELY WITH CONDITIONS LASTING AS THEY ARE THROUGH THE

OF THE CAULDRON, AS WE SEE THE EIFFEL TOWER, SPARKLING BEHIND ME THERE, WE WITNESSED AN INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE FROM
LADY GAGA, LeBRON JAMES, COCO GAUFF CARRYING THE FLAG ON TEAM USA, AS THEY CELEBRATED, ONE OF
THE THINGS I REALLY LOVED ABOUT IT WITH OPENING CEREMONIES THAT YOU SEE IN PREVIOUS OLYMPICS,
AND THIS WAS A HISTORY-MAKING OPENING CEREMONY, PREVIOUS OPENING CEREMONIES YOU WOULD
HAVE THE PERFORMANCE, THEN YOU WOULD HAVE THE ATHLETES PARADE.
BUT HERE WHAT YOU HAD, BECAUSE THE ATHLETES WERE ON BOATS AND TRAVELED ABOUT FOUR MILES ALONG
THE RIVER, HERE IS WHAT YOU HAD WAS THE PERFORMANCES AND CELEBRATION ALONGSIDE THE PARADE.
AND IT REALLY MADE IT ENTERTAINING. ANOTHER PART ALSO,
TEAM USA WAS SECOND FROM LAST, HOSTING THE SUMMER GAMES, THAT'S THE TRADITION, THAT MEANT IT REALLY BUILT MOMENTUM.
IN THE END THE FINALE WAS FANTASTIC AS WE'VE SEEN. IT WAS A REALLY GREAT NIGHT. IT POURED DOWN RAIN, IT WAS THE
