The Booming Business of Cutting Babiesâ€™ Tongues



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina tavernes and this is the [Music]
0:11
daily a times investigation has found that doctors are increasingly performing
0:16
unnecessary medical procedures that generate huge profits while often harming
0:24
patients today my colleague Katie Thomas on the forces is driving this emerging
0:30
and troubling Trend in American Healthcare and the story of one family caught in the middle of
0:37
it it's Monday February
0:43
19th so Katie tell me about this investigation so I am a healthc care
0:49
reporter who writes about the kind of intersection of healthc care and money
0:56
and I was working with two other colleagues Sarah cliff and Jessica silver Greenberg and together the three
1:02
of us had long been interested in are the medical procedures and the tests and
1:09
other things that we get when we go to the doctor or into a hospital are they always necessary but what we were really
1:15
interested in exploring was not just are these procedures and are these tests Etc
1:20
are they necessary but in some situations could they actually be harmful to patients and so that's what
1:26
we decided to to try and take a look at and so we had gotten started in our
1:31
reporting when we got a tip and it was from a mom in boisey Idaho and her name
1:39
was Lauren lavel hello gosh nice to meet you Hi how are you and my colleague
1:47
Jessica silver Greenberg and I went to her house to meet with her and where
1:52
does her story start I am a mom of two I live in boisee my daughter June is four
1:59
and I have a a 17-month-old Flora her story starts when Lauren gets pregnant with her daughter June so by the time we
2:05
got pregnant with June November of 2018 about eight months after we had the
2:11
miscarriage I think I was just more hesitant and nervous than anything Lauren and her husband had had trouble
2:17
conceiving and so they were so happy when they learned that they were going to have June and like both firsttime
2:24
parents they were also a little bit nervous but being Tae and super prepared I did all my homework we hired a
2:31
doua I wanted an epidural having an actal Tri birth absolutely was not for me and you Lauren
2:38
is very organized she's always on top of everything and she makes all sorts of
2:44
plans and she gets a lot of different providers lined up ahead of time I didn't know anything about breastfeeding
2:49
like zero things including one that she has hired to help her with breastfeeding
2:55
where did you find out about her so I asked ulla for a list of recommendations and she gave me a very short list at the
3:01
time there were very few lactation consultants in the valley and Melanie was one of them she ended up deciding to
3:08
work with Melanie henstrom who is a local lactation consultant in Boise she
3:14
sold this package at the time I don't know if she still did but it was like prenatal visit breastfeeding class and then she'll come to the
3:20
hospital and help you latch and then she'll come to the house a couple times after and I thought oh this sounds perfect great you know I'm covered there
3:27
so one week after her due date she gives bir and it was a difficult labor it took 24
3:32
hours Lauren was completely exhausted but once June arrived the family was
3:38
very very excited to have her and I remember June coming out and that
3:44
surreal feeling you have when you see your first baby for the first time like oh my God like there's a baby in the
3:50
room and June was a healthy baby but she was having trouble breastfeeding she would not latch like she wouldn't even
3:56
attempt she would scream it was the only time she ever cried would if you tried to make her to
4:02
breastfeed so as her pediatrician was making the rounds they noticed that June was having trouble she and said that
4:08
June's tongue is really tight we can clip it if You' like and that they could clip it and what does that mean exactly
4:15
Katie clipping her tongue what it means is that there's a small percentage of
4:20
babies whose tongue is very tightly Tethered to the bottom of their mouth
4:26
and for a very small percentage of babies their tongue is almost tied so
4:31
tightly down that they can't nurse well so it makes breastfeeding very difficult if a baby has a tongue like this exactly
4:38
if you bottle feed your baby the baby can basically adjust and make do but if
4:43
you want to breastfeed some babies have trouble basically latching on to their mother when they don't have that tongue
4:51
motion and so some version of clipping these tongue ties has been done for centuries midwives have been doing it
4:59
pediatrician s do it and traditionally what it's been is a very quick snip
5:04
right underneath the tongue just to loosen up the tongue and traditionally that procedure is extremely
5:12
straightforward there's little to no follow-up care and basically the baby naturally heals as it learns to
5:18
breastfeed and so we said okay you know they explained that it was completely painless they do it with scissors she wouldn't even feel it and all of that
5:24
was true they clipped it I don't even think she woke up but in June's case it didn't seem to help much and she and
5:30
Lauren were still having problems breastfeeding afterwards so while she's still in the
5:36
hospital she calls up the lactation consultant that she had hired Melanie henstrom just to let her know what was
5:42
going on and from talking to her on the phone Melanie said that the situation
5:48
was actually much worse than Lauren had thought and that Lauren's baby needed another tongue tie procedure a deeper
5:54
cut under the tongue how did she make this diagnosis Katie was it over the phone how did she know this yes Lauren
6:02
told us that it was it was from a phone conversation and in addition to that she
6:07
also warned her that basically you know Lauren and her husband should really
6:12
take this seriously and consider getting it done because if she doesn't get it
6:17
fixed it could lead to a whole host of problems Beyond just problems breastfeeding she'll have scoliosis and
6:24
she'll suffer from migraines and she'll never eat and she'll have a speech impediment she won't sleep I mean just like the long list of things over the
6:30
phone and Lauren starts panicking I mean first of all I felt I've never felt more terrible in my life than that first day
6:36
or so after giving birth like the come down from the hormones the drugs all of it the sleep deprivation and then you know here was
6:43
this baby we' wanted we were told we probably would never have after one
6:49
miscarriage and she's so perfect like the most beautiful baby i' ever seen and you think that she has some deformity
6:55
that's going to ruin her but Melanie says it's okay you know she has a solution and she tells Lauren that
7:01
there's a dentist in town who can handle cases that are as severe as Junes a
7:06
dentist why a dentist well there's a procedure that's done in a dentist's office that's a laser surgery and
7:14
dentists use this high-powered laser machine that can quickly cut the flesh
7:20
that connects the lips and the cheeks to the gums so according to Lauren Melanie
7:25
tells her that by chance this dentist has an opening because she said a family coming in from
7:31
Oregon had just canell their Saturday appointment so I thought okay wow you know people are coming in from Oregon to
7:38
see him so we talked about it we both felt unsure but we said well
7:46
let's at least take the appointment and then we can at least meet with the dentist and also someone can look at our mouth and assess and go from there
7:53
Lauren agrees to go in and and meet the dentist like I think some people when
7:58
they hear the story think like like why would you believe that like it just sounds so
8:03
scammy but to me there's a lot of things that you hear in the hospital that sound
8:09
insane like it's no different than someone saying like your baby's orange because their Billy Rubin their levers are too high so we got to go put them
8:14
under these lights like that sounds insane that sounds more insane than you know your baby's having a hard time eating CU their tongue is too tight and
8:21
it needs to be cut like that seems rational actually um and all of this
8:26
seemed really weird to Lauren at the time but you know in the context of the hospital and having a baby lots of
8:34
things about Healthcare are weird so one day after they got back home from the
8:39
hospital Laura and her husband pack up the car and go to the office early in the morning you know I was wearing my
8:45
Hospital diaper and an ice pack took the elevator up to his office and it's and what happen so Melanie greets them at
8:52
the door they sign some paperwork and pretty soon the dentist Dr Samuel zinc
8:58
arrives and and then he like very briefly you know very briefly looks in
9:04
her mouth and is like yeah she's got you know whatever however he classified it grade four whatever he says class 4 and
9:10
she has a lip tie which you know that had never been mentioned to us before so it's very much like on the spot like
9:17
this new piece of information you know pretty quickly the dentist diagnosed June is having a
9:22
couple of ties he confirmed that she had a tongue tie and he said it was severe
9:28
he also said that she had tightness under her top lip called a lip tie and so the baby actually needed to get two
9:34
cuts and again Lauren said that the dentist and the consultant told her how important it was for her to do this for
9:41
her baby one of us says like you know what happens if we don't do the
9:46
procedure like what are our Alternatives and it was like basically like there's no alternative like you have to do this
9:53
otherwise like again long La so Lauren and her husband decided to do it but before the proed procedure starts
10:00
Melanie actually stopped Lauren from coming into the room Melanie turned around and put a hand on my shoulder and
10:06
said oh no and I said oh am I not going with you she goes well we can't tell you no but you know if you hear her
10:14
cry it'll impact your milk supply like adversely what do I know so I said oh
10:21
okay and she pulled out the white noise machine and said what do you want to listen to and I had no idea what she was
10:28
talking about had no idea what it was and so then she just turned it on white noise and left what happens next is
10:36
Melanie turns on a white noise machine in the room and that was the moment that
10:41
I was like get your baby and get out of here and I didn't listen to it it was like
10:48
all of my mom intuition firing being like this isn't right you know it's like I don't know how to describe it but like
10:54
a full body you have to get your baby and get out of here and I just ignored
11:00
it she said her maternal instincts really kicked in and she just had this instinctive fear about the procedure and
11:08
whether June would be okay but the procedure itself was very
11:14
quick within just a couple of minutes Melanie returns with June and she was
11:22
screaming like screaming and so worked up this was like
11:27
hysterical inconsolable and she was also choking on something like gagging and June was so worked up
11:35
Lauren had only had her for a couple of days but she said that this was on a different level than any other way she
11:41
had ever seen June crying and June just wouldn't stop crying and she looked over
11:47
to Melanie and Lauren said that she remembered Melanie saying this was very
11:53
typical and so they pay the dentist they pay $600 for the procedure and then they
12:01
go home and what happens over the next several days June did not get better you
12:08
know as Melanie had assured them you know she was basically inconsolable Lauren said just crying hysterically and
12:16
Lauren and her husband you know they don't know how to comfort her they're they're new parents they've only had a
12:22
baby a couple of days and you know they're they're almost beside themselves there was nothing we could do and I
12:28
remember finally I said like this is not normal we're going to the emergency room
12:33
and they decided to go to the emergency room where a doctor looks inside jun's mouth and finds a large sore in in her
12:42
mouth that he says is probably causing her so much pain and so he said you know
12:49
it breaks my heart to see a sore that big in a baby this small it was like the
12:56
floodgates opened and like there was nothing but guilt and shame like
13:01
unmanageable guilt and shame like what have we done who are these people what have I done to my baby will she ever be
13:08
the same like what did I do so at this point Lauren is really understanding
13:15
that her intuition about this surgery was probably right and that she and her
13:21
husband may have really made a mistake with this what does June's recovery look
13:26
like so June never did end up feeding successfully which was the main reason
13:31
why Lauren and her husband had decided to do this procedure that was the whole point right that was the whole point
13:38
right and over the next couple of years June had a number of issues that you
13:44
know there's no official medical diagnosis for but Lauren has attributed
13:49
a lot of her behaviors to what had happened to her when she was just a few days old I mean you couldn't close the
13:55
fridge door too loud or else it would like set her off or you know we would attempt to take her for a stroller walk on the Green Belt which is the walking
14:02
path and she'd be asleep in her car seat you know stroller and someone would try to pass us on their bike and like ring
14:08
their Bell and it would startle her and it would just like set her off so she just was very very very
14:15
fragile so Lauren just wanted to get answers and she really wanted to hold
14:21
Melanie in the dentist accountable so she gathered all of the paperwork that
14:27
she had text emails other correspondents and she went to the Idaho
14:33
Board of Dentistry where she filed a complaint against the dentist and then she also went to a professional
14:39
organization that certifies lactation consultants and filed a complaint with them as well and did she get anywhere
14:46
with either of them at first no the Idaho Dentistry board didn't want to investigate and Lauren appealed and she
14:53
lost her appeal and she didn't initially hear back at all from the lactation board no one wanted to take
14:59
responsibility that's the thing no one wanted to stick their neck out there what's the
15:05
alternative the story never gets told and that's when she decided to reach out to us and after our story came out the
15:13
lactation board finally told Lauren that they were investigating Melanie and Katie you guys were reporting the story
15:19
I'm assuming you reached out to both the dentist and to Melanie what did they say
15:25
Beyond a very brief phone conversation that I had with melie in which you know she defended her work
15:31
and she said that she had a number of very satisfied customers she didn't
15:36
respond to detailed questions about Lauren's story or the stories of her
15:42
former clients and Dr zinc did not respond to our request for comment but
15:47
he did tell the Dentistry board that Lauren's baby's procedure was uneventful and that an extremely small percentage
15:54
of patients do not respond well to the procedure and how big of an issue is this Katie I mean how common is it for
16:01
mothers to have an experience like Lauren's so after we got the tip from Lauren and we dug deeper into her story
16:08
we found ourselves really surprised by how big this industry was for tongue Tai releases and in part it's been driven by
16:16
this movement for breastfeeding and the the breast is best campaign and a
16:21
growing number of parents who are choosing to breastfeed their children in turn that has sparked this big boom in
16:28
tongue Tai releases one study that we found showed that these procedures have
16:34
grown 800% in in recent years wow yeah and also as we started talking to other
16:41
parents around the country we learned that some of them had similar stories to what Lauren had told us there's plenty
16:48
of instances where there's no harm done to the baby at all when they get these procedures but we also found cases where
16:55
babies were harmed you know where they developed oral aversions which basically
17:00
means that they don't want to eat because they fear having anything put in their mouth including a bottle we found
17:08
cases where babies became malnourished uh had to be hospitalized we found more than one
17:14
instance in which babies had to be given a feeding tube just weeks after the
17:20
procedure so these sound so painful and awful for a newborn these problems but I
17:27
guess you know there's always a risk Katie in any medical procedure right I mean how much of this is just the risk
17:33
you sign up for when you agree that your baby should have a surgery well that's true I mean there's always a risk but
17:40
what you're supposed to do is weigh the risks against what the potential benefits of a procedure are and when we
17:46
really started drilling down into what those benefits were and into the medical
17:52
research we found there just wasn't a lot of potential benefit for these
17:57
procedures you know if if at all in many cases really so the procedures don't
18:04
have a medical reason to exist that's right we reviewed all of
18:09
the best quality medical research on this and you know other than that
18:14
old-fashioned snip under the tongue which does show that in some cases it can reduce pain for breastfeeding
18:21
mothers but otherwise all of this growth and all of these other more invasive
18:27
procedures we found there just wasn't good evidence that they help babies and the more we looked into tongue ties and
18:33
started to connect it to the other reporting we were doing we started to realize that it was driven by some
18:39
really big forces in our Health Care system that really had the potential to harm
18:45
[Music]
18:51
patients we'll be right back so Katie we talked about the this
18:58
new surge in a procedure that surgically unties infants tongues from the bottom
19:03
of their mouths often needlessly sometimes even harmfully and you said your reporting found that this surgery
19:10
was actually part of a broader Trend tell me about this trend and what's driving it so that's what this
19:17
investigation was really about to find the procedures that are doing unnecessary harm to patients and to
19:24
really kind of understand why this is happening you know like what's driving
19:29
the prevalence of these procedures and you know there's just a lot of unnecessary surgeries out there but we
19:36
decided to Center our reporting on three particular surgeries that had the potential to harm patients in addition
19:42
to tongue ties we focused on a particular Heria surgery a bariatric
19:48
surgery which can be overdone and cause harm and a vascular surgery done on patients legs to help us understand the
19:56
forces that were at work that were driving all of this and what did you find when you dug deeper into those
20:02
surgeries well it's very complex but we ultimately found three main drivers that were underlying all of these first
20:09
there's a financial incentive for the doctors to perform these surgeries there's also a real push from the
20:15
medical device companies that make these surgeries possible and last there's a huge information void for solid medical
20:22
advice that a lot of these doctors and companies take advantage of in order to push the surgeries okay so let's start
20:28
with the money Katie how exactly is that incentivizing doctors to perform a lot more of these procedures like what are
20:34
the mechanics of that so the reality of our healthcare industry today is that in
20:40
many places you know even in places like nonprofit hospitals the doctors who work
20:46
there are not getting a salary a straight salary that's just kind of you
20:51
get paid for showing up to work that day instead they're actually getting paid based on the procedures that they're
20:57
doing how complex those procedures are possibly how lucrative and it's not every doctor
21:03
there are still doctors that get paid salaries but it's increasingly the case
21:08
that doctors have at least a part of their pay is tied to the procedures that
21:14
they're doing interesting so the procedure is growing in importance in terms of actual compensation for doctors
21:21
right I mean in part it's kind of baked into the Health Care system that we've
21:27
always had you can even think about it as the small town Doctor Who operated his own
21:33
independent practice or her own independent practice it's essentially a small business and and they would get
21:39
paid based on the patients that they saw it but like increasingly even in for example large Hospital Systems where you
21:47
might think that a doctor is is just getting paid a salary to work in a hospital in fact you know a chunk of
21:54
their bonus for example can sometimes be tied to the procedures that they're
21:59
doing and that is increasingly the case interesting and so one particularly
22:06
egregious example of this was at a hospital that's in New York Belleview hospital and basically what my
22:12
colleagues found there was that they had basically turned their surgery Department into an assembly line for
22:17
bariatric surgery which makes your stomach smaller and can lead to weight loss but what we found was that they
22:24
were greenlighting patients that basically didn't meet the qualific ations for this surgery which is a
22:30
serious surgery and what they found was that there were several situations where people had very serious outcomes as a
22:37
result of getting the bariatric surgery there okay so this is an extreme case of a hospital turning to a particular
22:43
surgery to drive profits and it wasn't uncommon in your reporting it sounds like no it wasn't the only example but
22:50
it was the most striking and when we reached out to bellev they defended their work and they said that their
22:56
practices were helping patients who would otherwise get care but you know our reporting was pretty conclusive that
23:03
the program was turning through a record number of surgeries so what else was driving this increase in harmful
23:09
surgeries that you guys found so we found it wasn't just the hospitals who were benefiting the other major player
23:15
that benefits are these companies that are making the tools and the products that doctors are using during the
23:20
procedures and in order for them to sell more of their products a lot of time what they end up doing is promoting the
23:26
procedures themselves so like medical device makers like the company that made the laser in June
23:32
surgery right and you know they do this in a number of ways they're giving them loans to help them buy the equipment and
23:39
in some cases they're even lending them money to help set up those clinics where the procedures are performed so they're
23:45
really underwriting these doctors so that they can perform more surgeries and ultimately sell more machines yes and
23:53
the other things that they do is you know the the laser companies for example they will host webinars where they will
24:00
have dentists who who frequently perform these procedures show other dentists how to do the procedures we even discovered
24:08
this conference that was created by one of the laser companies and it had kind
24:14
of a wild name the name of the conference was tongue ties and Tequilas oh God right it brought in dentists to
24:21
talk about how to make money off the procedures you know how to promote themselves on social media how to
24:27
actually per formform the procedure and you know of course when they were all done they they got to celebrate with an
24:34
open tequila bar okay so a lot of this really amounts to these companies trying
24:39
to popularize these procedures basically like to get the word out even if the procedures don't really work or in some
24:46
cases cause harm right but they also play a big role in the other Factor that's driving a lot of this which is
24:52
the information that they put out there about the surgeries these companies often sponsor research which doctors
24:59
often rely on to guide their practices and you know part of what we found is
25:04
that it can kind of create this Echo chamber where doctors feel more comfortable and justified in doing these
25:11
procedures when they have kind of this whole alternate universe that is telling
25:17
them that it's okay to do these procedures and in fact it's beneficial to patients so tell me about this Echo
25:24
chamber effect the best example of this we found was a doctor in Michigan named
25:29
Dr Jihad Mustafa he calls himself the leg saver and what we found was that he and several other doctors do these
25:36
procedures called atherectomy which is basically like inserting a tiny rotor rer inside an
25:42
artery to get the blood flowing and Dr Mustafa in particular was not only a
25:47
very prolific performer of these procedures but he actually founded his own medical conference and even helped
25:53
start a medical journal that was devoted to using these procedures and you know like tongue ties there's
25:59
really no good evidence that these are actually beneficial to patients and in fact despite his nickname as the legs
26:07
saer One Insurance Company told Michigan authorities that 45 people had lost
26:15
their limbs after getting treated at Dr mustafa's Clinic over a 4-year period 45
26:22
people lost their limbs yes I mean that is the ultimate version of harm right
26:28
right now he he did speak to us and he defended his work and said that he
26:35
treats very sick people and despite his best efforts some of these patients are
26:41
you know already so sick that they sometimes lose their limbs and how much did he receive for each procedure
26:49
doctors like him typically receive about $3,000 for each of these atherectomy
26:54
procedures wow but we found that that misinformation or poor information also
27:00
applied when doctors were learning new types of surgeries really like how so
27:07
one of the areas we looked at was the area of hernia surgery that I mentioned and there's a particular type of surgery
27:16
it's a very complex version of a hernia surgery called component separation and
27:23
the expert surgeons that we spoke to said that it's difficult to learn and you have to practice it over and over
27:30
and over again to get it right but one recent survey of hernia surgeons said
27:35
that one out of the four surgeons had taught themselves how to perform that operation really yeah not by learning it
27:43
from an experienced surgeon but by watching videos on Facebook and YouTube
27:48
I mean how unusual is that I guess to me it strikes me as very unusual I mean I think of you know learning of about how
27:55
to take my kitchen faucet apart on YouTube but but I do not think of a doctor learning about how to perform a
28:00
surgery on YouTube right and you know it has actually become increasingly popular
28:06
in recent years and there's not good vetting of the quality of the
28:12
instruction we even found videos on a website run by a medical device company
28:18
that was intended to be a how-to for how to do these surgeries but the video contained serious mistakes wow and Katie
28:27
all of these videos some of them with serious mistakes I mean is this something that would be subject to
28:34
Medical Regulators like is there any kind of rules of the road for this stuff
28:39
you know there's less than you would expect sometimes hospitals have rules about what sort of Education their
28:45
doctors need before performing a surgery but we were surprised that there was a lot less regulation than we thought
28:53
there would be and much less vetting of these videos than we anticipated so
28:58
essentially what you found was this complex often times interconnected group of forces device companies pushing their
29:05
products hospitals bolstering their bottom line and rampant misinformation
29:11
that as you said all really Trace back to the same motivating factor which is money but wouldn't the fear of being
29:19
sued for medical malpractice prevent a lot of this Behavior you know this kept
29:24
popping up during the course of our reporting I do think we have this idea that anytime a doctor does anything
29:30
wrong they're going to get sued but that just wasn't always the case in our
29:36
reporting you know there's a lot of statutes of limitations time limits on
29:41
when somebody can file a lawsuit in other ways that make it somewhat hard to
29:46
really like hold a doctor accountable one example is the regulatory organizations that oversee doctors um
29:54
the one doctor that I mentioned earlier Dr Mustafa State investigators had found that his
30:02
overuse of procedures had led people to lose their legs and yet he ultimately
30:08
settled with the state and he was F $25,000 that actually adds up to about
30:13
two of these atherectomy procedures so it sounds like malpractice is not necessarily going to be the root to
30:20
rectifying a lot of this but I guess I'm wondering if the federal government could actually rein some of this in you
30:25
know before the patients are har you know it's possible but this is just a very difficult issue some of the
30:32
themes that we explored in this reporting are really just firmly embedded in our Health Care system and
30:37
the way that it works the fact is that we have a for-profit health care System right so everyone from doctors to
30:45
hospitals to the device companies benefit when more procedures are done all of the incentives are pointing in
30:50
the same direction right and so trying to find one or two Simple Solutions will
30:56
probably not easily fix the issue as much as we all hope that it could so is the lesson here be much more
31:03
discriminating and Vigilant as a patient I mean to get a second opinion when you're standing in front of a doctor or
31:10
a dentist who's telling you that you or your baby needs a procedure yes I think
31:16
that is one of the takeaways but look we understood that even reporting on all of this was risky
31:22
because people could hear about these harmful surgeries and start wondering if everything that their doctors tells them
31:28
is a scam and of course while some of these procedures are harmful a lot of procedures are
31:33
life-saving but ultimately for now patients are kind of left on their own to navigate which a pretty complex and
31:40
opaque Health Care system when you have somebody standing in front of you saying you should do this it can be very
31:47
confusing right and this is something that Lauren talked a lot about just how confusing
31:53
all of this was for her there's a lot of information that you're getting that is truly like someone is speaking a foreign
32:00
language and because they do it all day long it's not user friendly like it isn't design for the comfort or
32:07
understanding of the person receiving the information there is so much blind trust
32:14
and faith that you have in the system in the providers who are giving you this information you trust like this is what
32:20
they do all day long so there is no real reason to question that is the system
32:27
that we have in this [Music]

33:10
charismatic anti-corruption activist led the opposition to Vladimir Putin for more than a decade his popularity was
33:17
broad extending far outside the realm of liberal Moscow and that proved threatening to the Russian authorities

confession from his wouldbe assassin on tape navali believed that Russia could

Ovation in Moscow my colleague Valerie Hopkins spoke to Russians who were play
34:27
in flowers in his

honor and expressing disbelief that he was gone and I asked them if they believe in the beautiful Rush of the
