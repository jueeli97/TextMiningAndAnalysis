The United States vs. the iPhone


0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:04
tavernes and this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:11
daily last week the justice department
0:14
took aim at Apple it was the latest and
0:17
most Sweeping in a series of
0:18
antimonopoly cases against the Titans of
0:21
Silicon Valley today my colleague David
0:25
McCabe on the United States versus the
0:29
iPhone
0:34
it's Tuesday March
0:37
[Music]
0:45
26th so David there was big news last
0:47
week out of Washington and that was that
0:50
the US government filed suit against
0:52
apple and this is just one in a series
0:56
of cases that the government is making
0:58
against big Tech you know the last time
1:00
you and I talked of course Google was
1:02
the one that was going on trial so tell
1:05
me about this case against
1:08
Apple so for five years the federal
1:10
government through the Department of
1:12
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission
1:14
has been pursuing these investigations
1:16
and ultimately bringing lawsuits into
1:17
whether the biggest tech companies have
1:19
broken antitrust laws and these are laws
1:21
that are designed to stop companies from
1:23
throwing their power around and they
1:25
have brought a Spate of these lawsuits
1:27
they sued Google for abusing Monopoly in
1:30
online search and advertising technology
1:32
they've sued meta which owned Facebook
1:34
for allegedly stamping out n competition
1:36
when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp
1:39
and the government sued Amazon for
1:41
allegedly squeezing the third party
1:42
Merchants that use its site and while
1:46
the individual allegations in each one
1:47
of these lawsuits varies the basic
1:51
argument is this that these companies
1:53
have IL legally maintained monopolies or
1:56
otherwise subverted competition that
1:58
it's been bad for the economy it's
2:00
reduced choices for consumers it's
2:01
limited Innovation and it's led to
2:03
higher prices and last week the justice
2:05
department filed one of these lawsuits
2:07
against apple and this lawsuit is in
2:10
some ways the most sweeping we have seen
2:11
yet it targets what is one of the most
2:14
valuable companies on the planet apple
2:16
is worth trillions of dollars and it
2:19
takes aim at the heart of Apple's
2:21
business a product that is recognizable
2:23
to billions of consumers around the
2:25
world and has changed daily life as we
2:28
know it and that's the iPhone
2:30
so David the last time we talked you
2:33
taught me that simply being a monopoly
2:36
in and of itself is not illegal right
2:38
like if lots of people like a company's
2:40
product and it ends up as a monopoly
2:42
because of that that's okay but if the
2:44
company uses its power of bigness to
2:47
keep competitors out that's when a
2:50
company kind of crosses into the illegal
2:53
territory so what are we seeing the
2:55
government argue here that's right if a
2:57
monopoly is maintained through
2:58
exclusionary or predat means that's when
3:01
a company starts to violate the law and
3:04
that's exactly what the government is
3:05
arguing Apple has done here and
3:06
particularly the theme that they've hit
3:08
on again and again is exclusion that
3:11
Apple excluded other companies from
3:14
offering products that compete with its
3:16
own services or excluded other phones or
3:19
devices from interacting with the iPhone
3:21
in a way that was really good for
3:23
consumers and that those things were
3:24
designed to make a consumer more reliant
3:26
on the iPhone and make it harder for
3:28
them to switch away from the iPhone and
3:31
that all of these things built what the
3:33
justice department is calling a moat
3:35
around the iPhone a moat like a moat
3:38
around a castle precisely yeah filled
3:41
with alligators drawbridge the whole
3:43
deal okay so give me a better sense of
3:46
this metaphor so think of Apple as a
3:49
medieval Lord of some kind
3:53
okay Apple's got its castle in the
3:55
castle is the Crown Jewel the iPhone and
3:59
also all the people use the iPhone right
4:01
because that's the heart of Apple's
4:02
business all the people using the iPhone
4:04
using the services Apple sells you right
4:06
through the
4:08
iPhone and around the castle is this
4:10
deep moat with the alligators the
4:12
drawbridge is pulled
4:14
up and the moat makes it hard to get out
4:18
of the castle it also makes it hard for
4:20
competitors to get in and get at those
4:24
users got it okay so that metaphor is
4:27
clear so what exactly does a do jail
4:31
ledge so the first thing the government
4:33
argues Apple does to build this mode is
4:36
it simply doesn't allow other companies
4:38
to offer apps on the iPhone that might
4:41
diminish the value of the phone to
4:44
users and there are a number of examples
4:46
in the lawsuit about this but the first
4:49
one that really matters is digital
4:51
wallet so it has become increasingly
4:53
common for consumers to pay for
4:54
something like let's say you go to a
4:55
coffee shop uh to pay by tapping their
4:58
phone against a little payment terminal
5:00
right rather than taking their credit
5:01
card out on the iPhone only apple is
5:05
allowed to provide a digital wallet like
5:07
that it's called the Apple wallet and
5:09
the Department of Justice is saying that
5:11
they don't allow other companies to
5:13
offer that kind of service because it
5:15
might reduce Apple's hold on iPhone
5:17
users and make it less costly for those
5:20
users to switch to a different phone and
5:22
take their digital wallet with them so
5:23
that's one example and by less costly
5:26
you mean it would be easier to switch
5:28
out of an iPhone exactly another way the
5:31
government says Apple built its mode is
5:33
by not allowing users to download game
5:36
streaming apps okay what's a game
5:39
streaming app a game streaming app lets
5:40
you play a video game like you're
5:42
watching a show on Netflix instead of
5:44
downloading the game directly to your
5:46
phone you play it on a remote computer
5:49
far away from you so streaming video
5:51
games basically exactly streaming video
5:53
games and the government says that if
5:55
iPhone users were allowed to stream
5:57
video games that it would make the phone
5:59
less valuable to them because the iPhone
6:00
has a really powerful computer chip it
6:02
can play games directly on the phone but
6:05
if game streaming makes that unnecessary
6:08
the government says why would they need
6:10
the expensive powerful iPhone in the
6:12
first place got it so basically kind of
6:15
trapping them in this kind of more
6:17
expensive environment than is needed for
6:20
this kind of gaming thing exactly so
6:23
what else is the government alleging
6:24
here the government says that Apple has
6:27
also built its mode by making sure that
6:29
the iPhone doesn't work very well with
6:32
other types of devices that aren't made
6:36
by Apple and there's two examples of
6:40
this one is the Smartwatch so Apple
6:43
makes a device called the Apple watch
6:45
it's very popular it tracks people's
6:47
Fitness it lets them respond to
6:49
notifications and send text messages
6:51
directly from their risk people's wrists
6:53
are beeping all the time now exactly but
6:55
other companies make smart watches too
6:58
and the government says that the phone
6:59
works less well with those other devices
7:02
not made by Apple than it does with the
7:04
Apple watch a prime example of this is
7:07
that users can respond to Notifications
7:10
directly on their Apple watch if they're
7:13
using a non-apple smartwatch they can't
7:15
do that in the same way and the
7:18
government says that that's all an
7:20
attempt to make it harder for people to
7:22
leave the iPhone because once they own
7:24
the expensive Apple watch they're not
7:26
going to want to switch phones and the
7:28
watch right that would be much more
7:30
costly hundreds of dollars more
7:35
costly the next example is messaging
7:39
right the green and the blue like
7:41
someone doesn't have an iPhone basically
7:43
exactly so I have an iPhone and if I'm
7:45
talking to someone who also has an
7:47
iPhone and Apple's messaging app the
7:49
messages are blue there are things like
7:51
an indicator of when one of us is typing
7:54
the videos that we send are really rich
7:56
the conversation is encrypted by default
7:59
right which makes it more private but if
8:02
I'm talking to someone who has an
8:03
Android their messages are green you
8:06
don't have things like that typing
8:07
indicator the videos can be more
8:09
pixelated the government says the
8:11
conversation isn't encrypted and the
8:14
government says that Apple has designed
8:16
this dichotomy the green bubble blue
8:18
bubble dichotomy in order to kind of
8:21
create a stigma around phones that are
8:23
not the iPhone suggest their lower
8:25
status and that indeed non iPhone users
8:27
suffer from a social stigma because they
8:29
don't have an iPhone and the Department
8:32
of Justice says that this is
8:33
particularly cute for teenagers and
8:35
presents data that like 88% of teenagers
8:38
say their next phone will be an iPhone
8:41
then the government quotes someone in
8:43
apple saying that making messages
8:46
compatible or more compatible across
8:48
types of phones would just open the door
8:51
to iPhone families giving their kids
8:53
Androids interesting so David I have to
8:57
tell you this is the point in the
8:58
episode where I admit to you that I do
9:00
not have an iPhone I have an Android
9:02
phone and you know maybe I suffer from
9:04
social stigma I am one of those green
9:06
messages in your phone in fact I think I
9:07
was this weekend um but you know I guess
9:11
it was about five years ago I just kind
9:13
of stepped out of the castle and swam
9:15
across the moat and it actually wasn't
9:17
that hard so I guess I'm wondering you
9:20
know how the doj is saying that this
9:23
actually harms consumers if you can just
9:26
leave like I did what's the actual harm
9:30
well first of all the statistics suggest
9:33
switching rates are relatively low from
9:36
iPhone to Android that relatively few
9:38
people have an iPhone and then they go
9:40
and buy an Android so you're saying
9:42
first of all Sabrina you're weird not
9:44
weird but perhaps statistically
9:46
anomalous so while data suggest that not
9:48
that many people switch the government
9:50
is saying that Apple has a durable
9:53
Monopoly over smartphones in the US
9:55
they're saying that by Revenue apple has
9:58
a more than 65 % share of smartphones
10:01
generally and a More than 70% share of
10:03
what they call Performance smartphones
10:05
so think about like high-end devices
10:07
from companies like Apple or Google or
10:09
Samsung and then because Apple has built
10:12
this very effective system this
10:13
effective Moe for maintaining that
10:15
Monopoly that it does not have to
10:17
compete with the Samsungs and the
10:19
Googles of the world in a full-fledged
10:20
way and that the way that that harms
10:22
consumers first and foremost is because
10:24
they don't have to compete on price that
10:26
they can continue to charge high prices
10:29
for for the iPhone because there is an
10:31
absence of competition here so
10:33
essentially the government is arguing
10:35
that Apple by Dent of having this what
10:37
it calls Monopoly you know this captive
10:39
audience basically is charging more to
10:42
Consumers that's right and the
10:44
government argues that there are other
10:46
harms too ones that might be a little
10:48
less material but that Apple's Monopoly
10:51
might harm the possibility of future
10:55
innovations that they're not allowing
10:57
companies to go create and offer an
11:00
iPhone cloud gaming service that they're
11:02
not allowing companies to go and create
11:04
an awesome digital wallet for the iPhone
11:08
that effectively they're making it
11:10
impossible for companies to go out and
11:11
invent new good things for consumers so
11:13
the government offers one idea here
11:16
which is you could imagine another
11:17
company let's say it's a bank or venmo
11:21
would offer its own digital wallet on
11:23
the iPhone and and could offer a benefit
11:25
to users like cashback every time they
11:27
use that digital wallet and if you play
11:30
that out there could be a competitive
11:32
process where apple offers its own
11:34
rewards to get people to use the Apple
11:36
wallet but what the government argues
11:38
here is that basically that whole
11:40
process of competition that leads to new
11:42
benefits for consumers has been short
11:44
circuited by Apple when it denied the
11:46
ability of other companies to put their
11:48
own digital Wallets on the phone because
11:50
the companies who would be inventing
11:51
those new good things can't go to the
11:53
main platform they'd be selling it on
11:55
because they're blocked right that
11:56
they're denied from accessing that
11:58
product to a big part of the market and
12:00
so it's not worth doing so David just
12:02
listening to you lay all of this out I
12:05
mean it really seems like apple is doing
12:07
what every company tries to do which is
12:10
to make it hard to leave their own
12:12
products right and switch to a
12:14
competitor's products I mean keeping
12:16
itself kind of sticky but I guess I'm
12:18
wondering is that actually illegal like
12:22
isn't that just smart business well and
12:24
that will be the question for the judge
12:26
who is hearing this
12:28
case
12:30
they will have to look at the arguments
12:32
laid out by the doj at the arguments
12:34
laid out by Apple and figure out did
12:37
this cross a line right from Simply
12:39
aggressively competing to something that
12:41
was against the
12:44
law and always these cases come down to
12:46
two stories one that the government
12:48
tells about a company that has
12:49
perniciously stepped over the line and
12:52
one the companies tell about how in fact
12:54
they're providing benefits to Consumers
12:57
and competing fairly and apple already
13:00
tells a very different story here it
13:02
says that what the Department of Justice
13:05
presents as this evil moat around the
13:08
iPhone that bundle of practices are in
13:11
fact one of the company's greatest
13:16
strengths we'll be right
13:18
[Music]
13:28
back
13:31
okay so David you just said that apple
13:33
is arguing that you know its defenses
13:35
this Mo that they've built that the
13:37
government is arguing is unfair and
13:39
illegal is actually one of its greatest
13:42
strengths so tell me about that what is
13:44
Apple saying exactly apple is saying
13:47
that the steps that it's taken that the
13:48
Department of Justice is painting as
13:50
illegal are in fact designed to create
13:53
an experience that consumers love and
13:55
that keeps them safe a major argument
13:58
for and a lot of these practices are
14:00
good for security and you've probably
14:03
noticed that Apple has sort of marketed
14:04
itself as a more private option A more
14:06
secure option they run ads about the
14:09
privacy of the iPhone right they've
14:11
gotten into a big fight with the
14:12
government over encryption in the San
14:14
Bernardino shooting several years ago I
14:17
remember this the FBI actually got the
14:19
guy's phone the phone of this Mass
14:20
shooter but then couldn't get into it
14:22
because the encryption software was so
14:24
strong on the iPhone exactly and apple
14:27
is saying that that commitment to
14:29
security lives in a lot of these
14:30
practices that the government is
14:32
targeting a great example is the wallet
14:34
so the way they exclude other companies
14:37
from making digital wallets is they
14:38
don't let them access the physical chip
14:40
that interacts with the technology at
14:42
the coffee shop to make the payment and
14:45
apple says they don't do that because
14:46
they want to create the safest and most
14:48
secure experience for users when they go
14:51
to pay for their coffee with their
14:53
sensitive banking
14:55
information but more broadly the
14:57
argument that apple is making here is
14:59
that all of these practices to control
15:01
the system around the iPhone to control
15:04
the experience for users on the iPhone
15:06
is about creating a sort of magical
15:08
Experience for iPhone users where
15:10
everything works together and apple is
15:12
saying that users love the end result
15:15
they love this experience and that apple
15:17
is going to defend that experience from
15:20
government intervention so apple is
15:22
basically saying look they're not
15:24
trapped they can leave anytime they want
15:25
they want to be here that's right and
15:28
they want to be there because they love
15:29
their Apple products right they want an
15:31
iPhone right exactly so what about the
15:35
Topline argument that doj is making that
15:37
Apple actually has an illegal Monopoly
15:41
on smartphones like you know that Apple
15:43
kind of has cornered the
15:44
market so Apple says that's just not
15:47
true so you may remember the Department
15:49
of Justice is arguing that Apple has by
15:51
Revenue in the United States a more than
15:54
65% share of the total smartphone market
15:58
Apple says no no no the way to
16:00
understand this is a global market
16:02
because outside the United States
16:04
iPhones are far less popular Androids
16:06
are more popular and so apple is saying
16:09
if you count the whole world we have
16:11
about a 20% share of the smartphone
16:13
market we don't have a monopoly at all
16:16
oh interesting so Apple's saying look
16:17
you got the wrong Universe right the
16:19
universe is not the United States the
16:20
universe is the world that's where we're
16:22
competing right that's exactly what
16:24
they're saying so David how do we think
16:26
this is actually going to go for Apple I
16:28
mean it's been in court on some of these
16:31
issues before right so what do those
16:32
cases tell us what they tell us is that
16:35
Apple fights back hard and when it does
16:38
make changes they're largely around the
16:40
margins of the business they've not
16:42
radically changed their business in
16:43
response to government pressure or
16:45
pressure from court cases so there's a
16:47
couple examples of
16:49
this one really contentious point over
16:52
the last several years has been that the
16:54
only way for a developer to get their
16:56
app onto the iPhone is to sell an Apple
16:58
Store and if you sell an Apple Store
17:00
once you offer some sort of inapp
17:02
purchase imagine a subscription or some
17:05
other digital good that you buy in the
17:06
app you have to use Apple's payment
17:09
system which takes a commission as high
17:10
as 30% now apple has a new high-profile
17:14
lawsuit on its hands the game developer
17:16
epic games has filed a lawsuit against
17:18
apple and so epic games Epic Games they
17:21
make fortnite and fortnite is hyper
17:24
popular which makes a very popular game
17:26
fortnite sued apple and they alleged
17:28
that this whole system was anti
17:30
competitive now the legal complaint
17:32
seeks to establish Apple's App Store as
17:34
a monopoly Apple says you can't go
17:37
around our system and buy directly from
17:40
epic games from fortnite you have to buy
17:42
through us they were trying to basically
17:45
bypass the payment system not pay that
17:47
potentially as high as 30%
17:50
commission well Apple stock tumbled a
17:52
little over 3% today after a judge's
17:55
ruling in the company's Court battle
17:57
with fortnite and the judge in the case
17:59
did require Apple to ease some of its
18:02
restrictions on app developers under the
18:04
ruling app developers will now be
18:06
allowed to send users to other payment
18:08
systems but it wasn't all bad for Apple
18:12
but the judge didn't make them abandon
18:14
their business model entirely the judge
18:16
also sided with the Tech Giant on every
18:19
other key point in the case Okay so
18:22
that's kind of a win for Apple although
18:24
slightly mixed one apple did make
18:26
changes but they didn't have to abandon
18:28
in the golden goof entirely right
18:30
another example is in Europe where the
18:32
company faces fresh charges from the
18:34
European commission over its App Store
18:36
practices the European commission fined
18:39
Apple 1.8 billion EUR in early March for
18:42
allegedly thwarting competition among
18:45
its music streaming Rivals and this was
18:48
driven by complaints from companies like
18:49
Spotify which say that Apple exerts an
18:52
unfair amount of control over the
18:54
relationship that they have with their
18:56
consumers the competition commissioner
18:59
said the company had for a decade abused
19:01
its dominant position in music streaming
19:03
apps but it's an example of Apple
19:05
fighting back they say they're going to
19:06
appeal this fine and it's expected that
19:09
process will go on for some
19:12
time so this is again Rivals alleging
19:15
that apple is kind of abusing its
19:17
Privileges and bigness with the App
19:18
Store and this is being investigated by
19:20
the European Union exactly the pattern
19:23
has been relatively clear over and over
19:25
again software developers have accused
19:27
Apple of taking onerous fees and
19:30
applying unfair policies to their
19:32
businesses Apple has fought back when
19:35
Apple has lost those fights they've
19:36
agreed to make minor concessions but
19:38
often they have continued to push back
19:39
and continued to fight now all of this
19:42
of course is the App Store we've been
19:44
talking about that's not the doj case
19:46
right the doj case is much bigger that's
19:49
right so effectively the kind of
19:52
aggressive control that Apple exerts
19:54
over app developers that Spotify and
19:56
epic games have been arguing about the
19:58
government is saying that Apple uses
20:00
that control in all kinds of different
20:02
ways to build this moat that protects
20:04
the thing it really cares about the
20:06
iPhone right and it's probably worth
20:08
noting here that Apple says that they
20:10
are changing some of the practices that
20:12
are laid out in this lawsuit that
20:13
they're going to make it easier for
20:15
messaging apps on different phones to
20:17
talk to each other and become more
20:19
permissive for gaming apps but it's
20:21
unclear how those changes might impact
20:22
the case David how much of an uphill
20:26
battle does the doj face here I mean I'm
20:29
thinking back to the case we talked
20:30
about you know against Google and it did
20:33
seem like quite a climb for the doj to
20:35
actually prove its case against this
20:37
Tech Giant proving these cases is
20:40
difficult and you're dealing with a
20:42
company with almost Limitless legal
20:44
resources they're going to fight back
20:46
hard and it will take a long time these
20:49
cases usually drag on before trial for
20:52
multiple years apple is expected to file
20:54
a motion to dismiss the doj lawsuit so
20:57
that will provide an early sense of how
21:00
strong the case is but the truth is the
21:03
current leadership of the justice
21:04
department may not be in place when this
21:07
case finally goes to trial so they filed
21:09
something that may well outlive them and
21:12
how does that political change affect
21:14
the case presumably they'll continue it
21:16
right well a new Administration could do
21:19
what they wanted to with the case this
21:21
investigation started under a Republican
21:23
president so it's possible a new
21:25
Administration would keep things going
21:27
but they could also settle with Apple or
21:29
withdraw the case all those things
21:30
remain options as they go to trial got
21:33
it and what is the doj's kind of dream
21:36
scenario here I mean what does it want
21:38
to have happen with Apple so the justice
21:41
department has asked first and foremost
21:43
for the court to stop them from doing
21:44
the things described in the lawsuit stop
21:46
them from excluding certain types of
21:48
apps or making certain products less
21:50
compatible with the iPhone than Apple's
21:52
own products but the devil will really
21:55
be in the details of the judge's ruling
21:57
if the judge rules that broke the law in
21:59
a lot of different ways that may
22:01
influence how the Department of Justice
22:03
ultimately asks the judge to fix matters
22:05
in this case so they could ask for
22:08
changes to Apple's Behavior they could
22:09
ask for changes to the structure of
22:11
Apple but they really are holding their
22:13
cards fairly close to the vest while
22:15
they wait to see how a court rules on
22:17
the substance of the allegations so
22:19
David I just want to step back here for
22:20
a second and really kind of think about
22:22
what the government is doing here it's
22:25
taking one of the single most valuable
22:27
companies in the the world and is trying
22:30
to fundamentally change the way that
22:32
company operates I mean that strikes me
22:34
as kind of a potentially risky thing to
22:36
do right it could be very damaging to
22:38
this valuable American company and as a
22:41
result to the US economy well the
22:44
government says that it's worth it that
22:46
enforcing the competition laws in this
22:48
country is good for the economy and
22:51
they've really leaned on the Justice
22:53
or's Long litigation with Microsoft at
22:56
the turn of this century basically
22:58
they've been arguing that Microsoft
23:01
would force to allow things like Apple's
23:03
own iTunes product onto windows and as a
23:06
result it opened the door for Apple to
23:08
build this whole ecosystem that resulted
23:10
in the iPhone so what the government
23:13
believes is that yes they are accusing a
23:17
major company of
23:19
wrongdoing but that in doing so they
23:21
will open the door to innovations that
23:24
we can't even conceive of so there would
23:26
be a net benefit for both American
23:29
society and for the economy right but
23:32
David there's an interesting tension
23:33
here right I mean of course the
23:35
government is arguing that you know all
23:37
of these things are in service of a
23:38
better brighter future in the American
23:41
economy but a lot of people would say
23:43
they choose Apple products because they
23:45
like them better like they like Apple's
23:47
you know ecosystem they like being in
23:50
the castle so I guess there's a real
23:52
contrast there with what the
23:53
government's trying to do because
23:55
fundamentally at the end of the day this
23:58
company is quite popular with
24:00
consumers well and the government
24:02
presents itself first and foremost as a
24:03
law enforcement agency that here is a
24:06
company that regardless of how popular
24:08
its products are has broken the law and
24:11
needs to be held to account but this is
24:13
a really fascinating moment for reasons
24:15
that go beyond any one case think about
24:18
what's Happening Here the government has
24:20
filed lawsuits against the biggest
24:22
defining American tech companies of our
24:24
era and it's promising that this will
24:28
lead to an Era of new innovation of
24:30
better choices for consumers even lower
24:32
prices and now we're going to see
24:35
whether or not they were right and
24:37
consumers will see it in the way that
24:40
these products change in the way that
24:42
this industry which defines so many
24:44
aspects of American Life operates going
24:47

forward David thank you thank you for

25:13
back here's what else you should know
25:15
today I shall put the draft resolution
25:18
to the vote now on Monday the United
25:21
Nations security Council passed a
25:23
resolution calling for an immediate
25:25
ceasefire in Gaza breaking a 5-month
25:29
impass in which the United States vetoed
25:32
multiple calls for a halt to the
25:35
fighting the us abstained from the vote
25:38
allowing the resolution to pass the
25:40
result of the Voting is as follows 14
25:43
votes in favor zero vote against one
25:49
abstention the draft resolution has been
25:52
adopted at resolution
25:54
2728
25:57
2024 the us faced immediate criticism
25:59
from Israel's prime minister Benjamin
26:02
Netanyahu who canceled meetings in
26:04
Washington between an Israeli delegation
26:07
and US officials a public rebuke to
26:10
President Biden who had asked for the
26:13
meetings and President Vladimir Putin of
26:17
Russia acknowledged for the first time
26:19
that the bloody assault on a concert
26:21
hall near Moscow was executed by quote
26:24
radical islamists however he continued
26:27
to assert that Ukraine probably played a
26:30
role Putin said that the tragedy was
26:33
likely ordered by Ukraine asserting that
26:35
the asants were on their way there after
26:38
their attack and saying quote the
26:41
question is who benefited from
26:44
it finally Donald Trump is all but
26:47
certain to become the first former US
26:50
president to stand trial on criminal
26:52
charges after a judge on Monday denied
26:55
his effort to delay the proceedings
26:58
the trial in which Trump will be accused
27:01
of orchestrating the coverup of a sex
27:03
scandal surrounding his 2016
