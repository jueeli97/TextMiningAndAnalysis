How One Family Lost $900,000 in a Timeshare Scam



0:01
hello James hello hey how's it going
0:08
yeah I'm not having much luck so the problem is funding and all of my
0:19
money is in Mexico all of
0:25
it from The New York Times I'm Katherine benold this is the
0:30
daily a massive scam targeting elderly Americans who own time share properties
0:36
has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars sent to Mexico once you move
0:41
forward and make your payment if anything were to happen he will directly pay you the full amount of what you're
0:48
entitled to including the Gams he will pay you the full amount you've got all
0:53
my money it's been sent I sold the freaking
0:58
house listen to this I sold a house that I
1:04
grew up in so that I could come up with funds to send to
1:12
Mexico I don't even have anything from the sale
1:18
nothing my colleague Maria abih Habib on one victim who lost everything and the
1:25
people on the other side of the phone that's it that's it there's nothing you know what that's what has been said
1:31
every freaking time every time just pay this that Rel
1:38
that's why we won't allow it to to happen again this is the last time
1:45
James it's Friday April
1:52
12th Maria you've been looking into this scam that's targeting Americans where
1:58
did your investigation start so several weeks ago I received a phone
2:03
call from a lawyer based in St Petersburg Florida who had been
2:09
contacted by a family who was very concerned that the father this man named
2:14
James was in the middle of being scammed he'd sent hundreds of thousand dollars
2:20
to Mexico and he was considering sending another
2:26
$157,000 when his daughter decided to call up the this law firm and try to get
2:32
her father to stop stop sending money to
2:37
Mexico so I called him a few weeks ago as I was trying to understand what was going on hello hi James how are you good
2:46
thank you good he's asked that his last name be withheld for privacy concerns
2:52
because he's quite embarrassed about the story that I'm about to tell you uh you're retired now but what were you
2:58
doing for work and if you're your wife was working what was her job I it was with the highway patrol James is a
3:05
retired state trooper from California and his wife Nikki is a former school nurse she was born in 51 so
3:13
7 oneish okay two she's just reminded me
3:19
72 and they're both in their early 70s and they own this time share that is in
3:26
Lake Tahoe California and they bought it in the 1990s for about $8,000 and for someone who did not grow
3:34
up vacationing in a time share remind me how exactly time shares work Time Shares
3:40
are essentially vacation properties and they tend to be beach resorts and
3:45
multiple people can buy into this property the ownership is a shared
3:51
ownership and this gives you the right to use the time share for one to two
3:57
weeks out of every year and so James and Nikki use their time share every other year with their daughters but as they
4:05
hit retirement age and their daughters are growing up and starting their own families they're just not really using
4:11
it that much anymore and time shares require the owners to pay off yearly
4:18
maintenance fees and so they're starting to think about maybe letting go of their
4:23
time share and selling it then one day in late 2022 James gets a a phone call
4:32
from a company that is purporting to be based out of Atlanta Georgia called
4:39
WorryFree vacations WorryFree vacations yeah that sounds enticing yeah and they
4:46
start off with a simple question which is do you want to buy a time share and
4:52
James says I already have a time share and then they say great well what about
4:58
selling the time share do you want to sell there's this Mexican businessman
5:03
and he's interested in your time share and he's willing to buy it for about $20,000 so we fig well what the heck you
5:10
know if we can make a few bucks on it we'll go for it and James jumps at the opportunity and did he do anything to
5:17
try and verify that this was real yeah so remember James is former law
5:24
enforcement and he feels very confident in his abilities to kind of sniff out un trustworthy people M so he goes online
5:32
and he goog this Mexican busman and sees that yeah he is a real person was he's a
5:38
very well respected individual in Mexico you know very well off and and this
5:46
makes James feel at ease you know that he's selling to a legitimate person that bfree vacations are who they claim to be
5:54
and that he's going to double his money overnight essentially and what happens next
6:02
well a couple of weeks after he makes the agreement with the buyer he's told
6:07
that he needs to send a couple of thousand doar to facilitate the purchase what does that mean
6:14
[Music] facilitate I can't remember specifically
6:20
whe it was supposed to be cross border registration so he's being told that
6:26
there are these fees that are paid directly to the Mexican Government or SPID or some other fee that was
6:35
Mexican government required or not a lot of these fees are the same types of fees
6:40
that you would pay in the United States for a real estate transaction so he begins wiring money to
6:46
an account in Mexico after that but a few days later we get a notification
6:52
well everything went well except that we have to pay an additional fee and that
6:57
every time that he sends one fee he's being told that you know he's got to
7:03
send another fee right afterwards does he get suspicious at any
7:09
point his wife is suspicious after you know the first
7:15
couple of payments she starts saying this does not feel
7:20
right but you know James is the former law enforcement officer right and he's
7:26
the one that basically handles the family finan and he's confident that all of this is
7:31
going to work out because he's being told that the buyer of the time share
7:37
will reimburse James for all of these fees once the sale goes
7:42
through Michael from the wor fee vacations was constantly reassuring your
7:48
money's in that account check with the commercial escro account it's there it's
7:53
just these PS have to be paid and you're being reimbursed for all of this they're
7:58
sending Jan documents that show all of the reimbursements that he's owed and how
8:05
much money he's going to get and this just makes him feel like you know all of this is kosher we had this commercial
8:12
esro company that was involved out New York so there was an air of legitimacy
8:19
that I was comfortable with you know maybe okay these guys just
8:25
need one more fee and everything is going to finally be cleared [Music]
8:34
but about a year in James starts to get suspicious he begins asking questions
8:40
because he wants his money and every time I asked hey is there a way I get a partial release of
8:46
these funds there was always no these funds have to be paid from your account before they're released mhm but
8:55
worry free vacations they pivot and they tell him that listen you know there are all these
9:01
complications it's going to be really hard to get your money out from this transaction I could pay about 30,000 in
9:09
change to reinvest the
9:16
$313,000 into an environmentally conscious development in
9:22
Loretto Mexico instead we've got this other investment opportunity in Mexico
9:27
and I'm sure you know where that is on the east coast of ahaja mhm and that is going to make you a huge
9:34
return even more money than you had thought that you were going to make much more than the $20,000 I'm suppos I'm
9:39
supposed to have like 54 million pesos in a Mexican bank account
9:47
yeah
9:54
okay so this is now no longer just about his time share they are now partners in
9:59
a real estate investment right and there's this whole new round of fees and
10:04
fines associated with that so how many payments would you say oh
10:12
jeez uh quite a few uh couple dozen at least maybe
10:19
more when was your last payment it would have been 17
10:26
January uhuh and what was that for for good
10:32
question and all along he believed it was necessary to pay these costs just to
10:39
get the money that he's owed you know the amount of money that I've sent to Mexico is just freaking
10:45
exorbitant and I mean it is it is approaching $900,000 or more
10:54
wow okay and at this point he sent about 900 $1,000 to Mexico over about a year
11:01
and a half nearly a million dollars that was almost all the money
11:07
that he and his wife had saved for their retirement wow it also included money from the sale of James's childhood home
11:15
and money that he had borrowed from his daughter and son-in-law about $150,000 from them it's it's awful so they were
11:23
completely cleaned out by these guys yeah and this is when his daughter asks
11:30
a law firm to look into this which is the point in the story when I meet James
11:36
and when we start talking it was clear to me that he just did not know what to
11:42
think even after losing this much money so this started in 2022 when did it
11:49
end we're still in it oh
11:55
jeez and he's still talking to the scammers and as a matter of fact uh
12:01
presently there was a request for 157,000 in change to clear up this whole
12:09
thing it would clear the entire issue out now and James is even considering
12:15
putting a second mortgage on his house to send that money that he'd been promised would finally clear all this up
12:22
one final payment of $157,000 it really sounds like he still
12:29
wanted to believe that this was somehow legit yeah it was pretty clear to me
12:35
that he was being scammed but I didn't definitively know what was going on so I
12:41
asked him if he could start recording his phone calls with the scammers would you be so kind as to do me a favor yes
12:49
would you be willing to give them a call and record
12:56
them I'll let you know a little secret I've been recording them and it turns out he already had
13:04
been were free vacation so he shared the recordings of
13:09
these calls that he'd had with these scammers over the last year or so and it was just remarkable it gave me huge
13:17
insight into how the scam worked and the way that it sounded over the phone is
13:24
Michael in I think he's trying to call me I couldn't get through pick up yes I believe he did try to call you sir um
13:31
give me a second I think he's only going to be in for a couple minutes one [Music]
13:37
second there were two main takeaways for me listening to these calls good afternoon Michael McCarthy
13:46
Michael I missed your call I was trying to pick up yeah don't worry yeah I figured something was wrong with your
13:52
phone everything okay the first is that these scammers had really gotten to know James so well and they really made James
14:00
believe that WorryFree was a company that was working for him that's why we need to hurry up and get this money over
14:05
to you because hey I'm losing my mind too I'm not even here to convince you
14:10
James I'm not you know I'm your broker and and one of the things they continuously say is trust me look I'm
14:18
I'm doing everything I can in my power and will on my end so James just look
14:23
like I told you from the get-go I'm going to resolve this and we are doing it just I just need you to you know
14:28
focus on the goal they would refocus the conversation on what James needed to do to get his
14:34
money back look if you make your payment as a security deposit right away they will release the funds to you with this
14:42
with these and the other thing hello I've been having so much trouble trying to reach you and I have not been
14:48
successful is that the scammers had created this elaborate cast of characters why don't you answer my calls
14:55
and some of them are really aggressive James shared a recording of this one man
15:00
who claimed to be an agent for The Mexican government and he basically started yelling at James I don't care if
15:07
your wife is at the hospital to be honest with you I don't give a damn but you know why I do give a damn it's your
15:14
money and my name is really all over it do you understand yes and he even
15:21
threatened James if James didn't pay off these fines then he would lose all the
15:26
money that he sent to Mexico already you could get the best lawyer you want you
15:33
could get whoever you want and this is not a threat this is facts but anyways
15:39
who am I to convince you right all right well thank you for the information
15:46
and uh are you still there hello wow so these scammers were
15:54
basically doing a good cop bad cop routine to stop James from walking away
16:00
and to squeeze every last penny out of him
16:05
exactly if you provide me your email contact information I will certainly be happy to forward all of the wire
16:13
transfer informations from my bank account to you so that you can see where
16:18
those funds went yeah that would be that would be great I have your email James asks me a reporter who's based in Mexico
16:25
who speaks the language if I could help him figure out where his money had gone to thank you very much I really
16:31
appreciate your assistance I'm just doing my job thanks again and we'll talk
16:37
soon and the only way that I could figure that out was to understand who
16:42
was on the other side of the [Music]
16:57
phone we'll be right
17:06
back so Maria who was on the other side of that phone
17:11
line so by the time that I'd met James I'd already gotten a tip from US law
17:16
enforcement agencies that they were seeing a new trend Mexican drug cartels
17:22
were getting involved in the time share scam industry drug cartels yeah and not
17:29
just any drug cartel this is one of the most notorious violent bloody drug
17:35
cartels that exists in Mexico and Latin America the halisco new generation
17:41
cartel H and when I looked at james' bank records guess what all the money
17:48
that he was sending was going to various bank accounts that were all located in
17:55
halisco state in Mexico wow so why would the drug cartels
18:01
get into the time share scamming business it is a huge business the FBI
18:07
told me that it's about $300 million in profits Over The Last 5 Years wow but
18:14
the thing is is that the potential for it to actually be multitudes more is
18:20
huge because the FBI estimates that most of the scams are actually not even reported in fact only about 20% are so
18:29
that means the total time share scam business could actually be much larger
18:36
than the $300 million that they have knowledge of over the last five years
18:42
but wait I thought the drug business was a pretty lucrative business in itself so why get into the scamming of elderly
18:49
people for their properties in Lake Tahoe well you have to remember that these drug cartels they're not just
18:55
doing one thing they're doing multiple things they're essentially conom because it's really expensive to run a
19:02
cartel you need to pay off officials both Mexican and American you need to
19:07
maintain basically an Army in order to secure your routes up to the United
19:13
States ports of entry into Mexico from Columbia and like any big business you
19:18
need to diversify your income to make sure that you keep the money flowing because you never know when one business
19:24
is going to be shut down by authorities or taken over by your arrivals we we've reported that they're now in the avocado
19:31
business and the construction business and time share fraud is basically no
19:37
different than any of those so we're seeing that the cartels have their fingers in many pies the legitimate and
19:45
the illegitimate economy here in Mexico it's kind of fascinating to think of these drug cartels as like sprawling
19:53
Diversified business Empires but when did the cartels first get into the
19:59
scamming business so halisco new generation started about 15 years
20:06
ago and when they started to consolidate their empire in Kisco State they found
20:12
that there were all these scam time share call centers all over the state
20:18
that were being run by various players and that this was a huge huge Money Maker because essentially all you have
20:24
to do is call up retired senior citizens in the US and Canada it doesn't take
20:29
that much money to run that kind of a scheme there's no products you're [Music]
20:34
making so essentially they conducted a hostile takeover of these call centers
20:40
they went in they kicked down doors and dragged out the people who were managing these call centers by their hair and
20:46
threatened to kill them unless they gave up the call centers or started handing over a cut of what they made and slowly
20:54
slowly Kisco New Generation cartel took over the entire time share fraud
21:02
[Music] industry interesting where you able to find any of these call
21:08
centers so these call centers are pretty hard to find they look like any other storefront but I was able to visit two
21:17
that were located in an upscale neighborhood in guadalahara which is the capital of halisco state M and it was
21:26
just really perturbing because it was just so normal two Villas about a mile
21:32
away from each other outside of one Villa parents were walking by holding their children's hands as they you know
21:39
did drop off at school it was right next to a park where people taking their morning exercise or their dogs for a
21:46
walk there was no real sign that the cartel was doing business there but a
21:51
few months before Mexican law enforcement had found the bodies of eight young people who had
21:56
used to work at one of these call centers and said that the Kisco cartel had killed them wow what
22:04
happened so I wasn't able to talk directly to any of the victim's families they're just too scared but in general
22:12
this is usually how it starts the cartel seeks out English
22:17
speakers to work for their call centers sometimes they don't even tell them what exactly they're doing they would tell
22:24
the recruits that the job was adjacent to the hotel industry hm
22:29
you have to remember halisco is a huge huge tourism magnet for Americans and
22:35
Canadians and others and the cartel would get their call lists from bribing
22:41
Hotel employees to give them the names of people who stayed at these hotels and
22:47
also at the time share Resorts and the people who would work at
22:52
the call centers or provided the names and a manual of of what you need to do when you call kind of like a loose
22:59
script of how to try to suck as much money as you can out of these people up
23:04
north in Canada and the states mhm so we don't know for sure what
23:11
exactly happened with the eight young Mexicans who were killed last year but
23:16
through an intermediary one sibling told us that when their family member knew
23:22
what their job actually was they became extremely uncomfortable and tried to Le
23:28
the call center and find another job maybe but the halisco new generation cartel is known for being extremely
23:35
brutal they chop off heads and they'll put them on the gates of a playground for instance so that everybody in the
23:41
neighborhood knows what went down and in this case it's possible that they wanted
23:47
to send a warning that there's no defection from their time share call centers so basically making a very scary
23:56
example of these guys in case anyone else is thinking about quitting one of the call centers
24:04
exactly and one man who runs an organization who advocates for missing
24:09
people and actually organizes search parties to comb the forests of halisco State looking for the missing says that
24:17
he knows of about 30 people who have disappeared from the call centers in halisco States since 2017 H so while
24:25
Americans and Canadians might be losing much of their life savings in Mexico
24:31
this is actually [Music]
24:40
deadly are the authorities doing anything about this not really other than the fact that
24:46
these two call centers were shut down the authorities haven't arrested others
24:52
they're not putting pressure on Mexican banks for instance to look into these payments coming from senior citizens in
24:59
the US or Canada and you have to remember that people are really afraid but you also have to remember that in
25:06
Mexico things are not that clear there is a lot of corruption and government
25:13
collusion with organized crime and cartels and the tourism
25:19
industry it is huge in Mexico and particularly in halisco State this is a
25:25
multi-billion dollar industry they don't want Americans or
25:30
Canadians or Europeans who are coming to Kisco for its beautiful beaches and its mountains to hear about these
25:37
stories regarding the cartels being involved in the tourism industry and
25:43
think you know I'm not going to send my family there for that Beach vacation it's just simply too dangerous so
25:50
everybody has an incentive to have the scam continue whether because they're too afraid and don't want to speak out
25:56
or because they're in on it so in a way local authorities have an
26:03
interest in sweeping it under the carpet in order to just maintain this idea of a
26:09
tourist destination exactly I mean the spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office
26:15
was very responsive to me until I told her what I wanted to ask her questions
26:21
about and then she just simply never answered any of my texts or phone calls so Maria based on everything you
26:29
know all the information you have would you say that you're confident that the cartels were the ones who scammed James
26:37
yes 100% everything I've seen points in that direction what did James say when you
26:44
told him this so it took
26:49
him quite a while to really allow himself to believe it on the advice of
26:54
his lawyers he stopped picking up the phone calls and uh about a week ago they
27:01
stopped after the scammers kept trying to call him but you said he was in it
27:06
for over a year why do you think it took him so
27:11
long can you tell me after all of that that had been presented to you why do
27:16
you think you weren't willing to be entirely convinced well I actually asked him that
27:22
question that's a very good question why wasn't I able to to pick up on that
27:29
right away and I think in the back of my mind uh I'm finding out that I'm a little more stubborn than I thought I
27:36
was and for him it was pretty complicated and I think that I didn't
27:42
want to believe that I had fallen for this I didn't feel I was that foolish
27:48
and stupid when it came to this you know I guess I didn't want to believe that I
27:54
could be fooled
28:01
to come to terms with the fact that he had lost so much money was to come to
28:09
terms with the fact that he wasn't the person that he thought that he was that he wasn't this kind of you know
28:16
clever former law enforcement officer who was used to fighting the bad guys
28:23
and and winning uh you know I'm I'm disappointed in myself
28:28
there's a huge level of anger towards uh the perpetrators and uh yeah all of those
28:36
things wrapped into one and and part of that I think contributes to not wanting
28:42
to actually believe that I was wrong
28:48
M yeah I hear you I'm sorry I can hear the pain in
28:53
your voice yeah
28:59
some of it's based on shame right that he lost all this money everything that he's worked for and the fact that this
29:05
was all supposed to be money that his children and his grandchildren were going to inherit and now it's
29:17
gone and have you told your daughter that you think you've kind of come to terms with the fact that this might have been a scam oh she's she's been uh
29:25
involved yeah they know my daughter does I'm sorry this is a tough
29:33
time yeah so I've got to make some sort of
29:39
arrangements to uh uh compensate them for this on top of
29:45
our regular debt so yeah it's been a swell experience all of it brought on by my
29:53
evidently my stubbornness to believe that I couldn't possibly be a
30:01
victim how's your wife doing throughout this whole process with this new
30:07
knowledge she's not real happy obviously at all uh I hear a lot of I Told You So
30:15
and at this point I've got no defense she's absolutely right there no question
30:22
about it do you worry this is going to affect your marriage
30:29
yes there has been an
30:35
effect and do you think that at this point there's any way for James and his
30:42
family to get some kind of Justice or at least find some kind of
30:50
closure I Justice unlikely at this point I'm not
30:56
necessarily expecting much in the way of restitution and as for closure it's a
31:03
little bit too soon to tell in a way James has gone through
31:09
several stages of acceptance of for what happened there's fear there's shame there's resignation and now he's talking
31:16
to me partly because he feels like it's a public service that you know he needs
31:23
to be vocal so that other people don't go through what he's gone through and fall for the SC
31:28
am and I think it also kind of helps him feel a little bit empowered in a
31:35
situation for over the last year and a half he was kind of at the mercy of these people who were calling him
31:42
multiple times a week I want to try to get as much
31:47
information to as many of these official organizations as
31:53
possible I have a streak of anger through me now that
31:59
I've uh developed to the point where I'm not going to let this
32:04
[Music]
32:11
go well Maria thank you thank you for having
32:17
