The Eclipse Chaser


0:01
can you hear Fred can you hear
0:04
me the internet is a little wonky
0:11
okay
0:13
so here isn't really
0:16
fast I think we're gonna call yeah I
0:18
think we're going to call you back on a
0:20
for the first time in a really long time
0:21
a
0:22
landline
0:23
[Music]
0:28
okay
0:31
hey Fred it's Michael Barbaro hi can you
0:34
can hear me okay I can hear you perfect
0:37
so Fred where exactly am I reaching you
0:41
I'm in Portal Arizona in a little
0:43
Community called Arizona sky village H
0:46
and it's a very rural community so our
0:50
internet and phone lines are not very
0:52
good and the nearest grocery store is 60
0:54
miles away wow and why would you choose
0:59
to live in such a remote place with such
1:02
bad internet because the sky is dark
1:05
it's like the sky was a 100 years ago
1:06
before cities en Crouch down all over
1:09
the country I guess you'd call it an
1:11
astronomy development mainly amateur
1:14
astronomers who have Built Homes here
1:16
far from city lights for the express
1:19
purpose of studying the
1:20
[Music]
1:24
sky so it's literally a community where
1:27
once the sun goes down it's Pitch Black
1:30
and some perhaps all of you are
1:34
stargaming yes exactly well I think I'm
1:37
beginning to understand why you might
1:40
have the nickname that you do can you
1:44
just tell our listeners what that
1:45
nickname is my nickname is Mr
1:48
[Music]
1:53
eclipse from The New York Times I'm
1:55
Michael Bavaro this is the
1:58
daily today
2:00
total solar eclipse will be watched by
2:02
millions of people across North America
2:05
none of them as closely as Fred espenak
2:09
a longtime NASA scientist who's devoted
2:12
his entire life to studying chasing and
2:16
popularizing the wonder that is an
2:21
[Music]
2:27
eclipse it's Monday a April
2:30
[Music]
2:40
8th Fred help me understand how you
2:43
become Mr Eclipse how you go from being
2:46
Fred to this it seemingly very
2:49
hard-earned nickname of Mr eclips well I
2:52
was visiting my grandparents at their
2:54
summer
2:56
home and it was a partial eclipse of the
2:59
Sun back in the early
3:01
1960s and I was a 10 or 12y old kid I
3:04
got my parents to get me a small
3:06
telescope and I watched some of the
3:08
partial phases and it was really
3:10
interesting and I started reading about
3:13
eclipses and I found out that that as
3:15
interesting as a partial eclipse is a
3:18
total eclipse is far more interesting
3:21
H the Moon is only 1400th the diameter
3:25
of the sun it's tiny compared to the Sun
3:27
but it's 400 times closer to the Earth
3:30
so it's just this incredible coincidence
3:33
that the moon and sun appear to be the
3:35
same size in the sky and once in a while
3:37
the moon passes directly between the
3:39
Earth and the Sun and you're plunged
3:41
into this very strange midday
3:46
Twilight but they're limited to very
3:49
small Geographic areas to see a total
3:51
eclipse and this little book I was
3:54
studying had a map of the world showing
3:56
upcoming Paths of total solar eclipses
4:00
and I realized that one was passing
4:01
through North America about 600 miles
4:05
from where I
4:06
lived and that that Eclipse was in
4:09
1970 and I was reading about this in
4:12
1963
4:13
1964 and I made it a promise to myself
4:17
that I was going to get to that eclipse
4:19
in 1970 to see it cuz I thought it was a
4:21
one chance in a lifetime to see a total
4:23
eclipse of the
4:24
[Music]
4:28
Sun
4:31
so just to be very clear you see a
4:33
partial eclipse and you immediately
4:35
think to yourself that was fine but I
4:38
need the real thing I need a full
4:40
eclipse and you happen to find out
4:42
around this time that a real eclipse is
4:45
coming but in seven years right I mean
4:48
there were other eclipses between that
4:51
time and seven years in the future but
4:53
they were in other parts of the world
4:55
and I couldn't buy an airplane ticket
4:57
and fly to Europe or Australia
5:00
mhm and by
5:02
1970 I'd been waiting for this and by
5:05
this point I had just gotten a driver's
5:08
license um and I convinced my parents to
5:11
let me uh drive the car uh 600 miles to
5:14
down into the path of totality to see
5:17
this great event wow wait from from
5:19
where to where from Staten Island New
5:21
York down to uh a little town in North
5:26
Carolina how did you convince your
5:27
parents to let you do that I mean that's
5:29
well I had seven years to work on
5:32
it right and you know I was I was just a
5:35
nerdy kid I I didn't get into trouble I
5:38
was interested in science I was out in
5:41
the woods studying frogs and Wildlife
5:44
and stuff so this was just a natural
5:46
progression of the type of things I
5:47
would normally do right okay so I wonder
5:51
if you can describe this journey you end
5:54
up taking from Staten Island how does
5:58
the trip unfold as you're
6:00
headed on this 600 mile so I think on
6:03
March 6th 1970 it was a Friday my friend
6:07
and I left to drive to the eclipse path
6:10
and we probably got on the road probably
6:12
at 5:00 a.m. because it was going to be
6:14
a very long day and we've got a detailed
6:17
map in the car which I've plotted the
6:19
eclipse path on and we're just trying to
6:22
get far enough South to get into the
6:24
path of the Eclipse which for us is
6:27
eastern most Virginia or east North
6:30
Carolina mhm and I drive and drive and
6:33
drive all day long very long day we get
6:36
down to North Carolina right about maybe
6:39
6:00 p.m. and we just see this little
6:41
town in North Carolina that we're
6:44
driving through and it happens to have a
6:47
convenient Motel right in the center of
6:49
the path and that was good enough got a
6:51
room available and we check in and
6:54
that's where we're going to watch the
6:55
eclipse
6:57
from and the next morning morning was
6:59
Eclipse
7:01
day it was a bright crisp Sunny morning
7:05
there weren't any clouds at all in the
7:07
sky and I was amazed that outside the
7:10
back of the motel in this grassy field
7:13
there were dozens and dozens of people
7:16
with telescopes out there specifically
7:18
there for the eclipse that morning H we
7:21
were really excited about this we set up
7:23
our my telescope and we had another
7:25
camera set up to watch it and we walked
7:28
around and and marveled at some of the
7:30
other people in their telescopes and
7:32
discussed the eclipse with them and the
7:33
eclipse started probably around um
7:36
around noon or 1 in the
7:41
afternoon describe the
7:43
actual event itself the eclipse how did
7:46
it begin well all solar eclipses begin
7:50
as a partial eclipse and the Sun is
7:53
gradually covered by the moon as the
7:55
moon takes larger and larger pieces out
7:57
of the Sun as it slowly crawls across
8:00
the sun's
8:02
surface and you don't really notice much
8:04
going on with a naked
8:10
eye it's really only in the last 10
8:13
minutes or so that you start to notice
8:15
changes in the
8:17
environment because now enough of the
8:19
sun has been covered upwards of maybe
8:22
90% of the
8:25
Sun and you start to notice the
8:27
temperature falling there's a chill in
8:30
the
8:30
air also since so much of the sun is
8:34
covered the daylight starts to take on
8:36
kind of an an
8:37
anemic uh quality it it's
8:40
weak the sun is still too bright to look
8:43
at but the surroundings the environment
8:46
is not as bright as it was a half hour
8:51
earlier you start to notice animals
8:54
reacting to the dwindling sunlight they
8:58
start acting like it's Sunset and they
9:00
start performing some of their evening
9:03
rituals like birds roosting perhaps
9:06
calling their their evening songs and uh
9:10
plants start closing up in the dropping
9:12
sunlight and in the dropping
9:14
temperatures and there's an acceleration
9:17
now of all these effects the temperature
9:19
drop the drop in the sunlight it starts
9:22
happening faster and faster and getting
9:25
darker and
9:26
darker and maybe about a minute before
9:30
the total eclipse began we noticed
9:33
strange patterns on the ground beneath
9:35
us on the grassy field that we were on
9:38
these ripples racing across the
9:41
field and these are something called
9:43
Shadow
9:46
bands they look a lot like the Rippling
9:49
patterns that you would see on the
9:51
bottom of a swimming pool bands of light
9:54
and dark and moving very quickly across
9:56
the
9:57
ground the sky is it's a dark blue and
10:00
it's getting darker rapidly uh in this
10:03
dwindling
10:04
sunlight and you go from daylight to
10:07
Twilight in just 10 or 20 seconds it's
10:11
almost like someone has the hand on the
10:13
rat turns the house lights down in the
10:18
theater you just see the light just go
10:21
right
10:27
down and the sky Sky gets dark enough
10:30
that the corona the outer atmosphere of
10:32
the Sun starts emerging from the
10:35
background
10:37
sky this ring or Halo of gas that
10:42
surrounds the Sun and
10:45
it's visible around the Moon which is in
10:48
silhouette against the
10:49
Sun and along one edge of the moon is
10:52
this bright bead of sunlight because
10:54
that's the last remaining piece of the
10:56
sun before it becomes total
10:59
and this is the diamond ring effect
11:01
because you've got the Ring of the
11:03
Corona and this dazzling Jewel along one
11:05
edge of
11:07
it you only get to see this for 10 or 15
11:12
seconds it's very fleeting before the
11:15
moon completely covers the sun's
11:19
disc and totality begins suddenly you're
11:22
in this Twilight of the Moon
11:27
Shadow and you look around the Horizon
11:31
and you're seeing the colors of Sunrise
11:33
or Sunset 360Â° around the Horizon
11:37
because you're looking out the edge of
11:38
the Moon Shadow and looking back up into
11:41
the sky the sun is gone now and you see
11:44
this black disc of the Moon in
11:46
silhouette surrounded by the sun's
11:49
[Music]
11:58
Corona
12:00
maybe this says more about my nature
12:03
than anything else but what you're
12:05
describing a little bit feels like the
12:07
end of the
12:09
world well I think when you see this all
12:13
transpire you can easily understand how
12:16
people thought this was the end of the
12:18
world because it seems far outside of
12:22
the Realms of nature it seems
12:23
Supernatural so you can see how people
12:26
panicked that didn't understand what was
12:28
going on that was not your reaction
12:32
no I think it's a sense of
12:36
of belonging belonging to this
12:39
Incredible Universe both belonging and a
12:43
humbleness that how minuscule we are and
12:46
yet we're a part of this fantastic
12:48
Cosmic Wheel Of Motion in the solar
12:51
system you almost get a
12:53
three-dimensional sense of the Motions
12:56
of the Earth and the moon around the Sun
12:59
when you see this sort of clockwork
13:01
displayed right in front of you this
13:03
mechanics of the eclipse taking place
13:06
it's almost like lifts you up off the
13:09
planet and you can look back down at the
13:11
solar system and see how it's all put
13:12
together and you've only got to in that
13:15
case in that particular Eclipse it was
13:18
only 2 and 1/2 minutes to look at this
13:20
well there's kind of a clock in your
13:22
head saying you don't have much of this
13:25
you don't have much of it it almost
13:26
seems like time stops
13:32
and at the same time all of a sudden
13:34
eclipse is over those 2 minutes just
13:36
Race
13:37
by and it's over and all of a sudden the
13:40
diamond ring forms again on the opposite
13:42
side of the moon um as the Sun starts to
13:45
become uncovered at the end of totality
13:48
and the diamond ring appears it grows
13:51
incredibly bright in just a few seconds
13:53
and you can't look at it anymore it's
13:55
too bright you got to put your filters
13:57
back on and and cover your telescope
14:00
with a solar filter so it doesn't get
14:02
damaged and you're trembling because of
14:05
this
14:06
[Music]
14:10
event everybody was cheering and
14:12
shouting and yelling I mean you would
14:15
have thought you were at a a sports game
14:17
and the home team just scored a
14:20
touchdown just everybody screaming at at
14:22
the top of their lungs and I immediately
14:25
started thinking that this can't be a
14:27
once in lifetime EXP experience I've got
14:30
to see this
14:31
[Music]
14:45
again we'll be right
14:49
[Music]
14:55
back okay so Fred it's the early 1970s
14:58
and you are are not Mr Eclipse yet
15:02
you're just a kid who felt
15:04
something very big when you watched an
15:07
eclipse so how did you end up becoming
15:09
the premier Authority that you now are
15:12
on
15:15
eclipses well after that 1970 Eclipse I
15:19
started looking into upcoming solar
15:21
eclipses so I could get a chance to see
15:24
the sun's Corona again mhm and the next
15:27
total eclipse was in Eastern Canada in
15:30
July of uh
15:32
1972 and I started thinking about that
15:35
eclipse and by then I was going to be in
15:37
uh college and I started planning
15:40
because that one was still something I
15:41
could drive to it was 12200 miles
15:44
instead of 600
15:46
miles so the summer of 1972 rolls around
15:50
and I drove up to the eclipse in Quebec
15:53
to se totality and was unfortunately
15:56
clouded out of the eclipse I saw some of
15:59
the partial phases but clouds moved in
16:01
and obscured the Sun for that view of uh
16:05
the sun's Corona you were robbed I was
16:08
robbed and I realized well I've got to
16:11
expand my Outlook on what's an
16:14
acceptable distance to travel to see a
16:15
total eclipse mhm because the next total
16:18
eclipse then in
16:20
1973 was through the Sahara desert in
16:23
Northern Africa so I traveled to the
16:25
Sahara Desert for the eclipse where we
16:28
had decent we weather not perfect but
16:30
decent weather that we got to see
16:32
totality there you saw totality in the
16:34
desert in the desert in the Sahara
16:36
Desert after that it was just trying to
16:38
get to every total eclipse I possibly
16:40
could get to at this point you're
16:42
clearly starting to become an eclipse
16:44
Chaser and I don't even know if such a
16:46
thing existed at that moment yeah I
16:48
don't think I don't know if it was
16:49
called that then but but certainly yeah
16:51
and and if you'll permit me a question
16:53
that might seem maybe Dopey to someone
16:56
in your
16:57
field after you've seen one or two or
17:01
three of these do they start to kind of
17:05
blend in together and become a little
17:07
bit the
17:08
same not at all each one is distinctly
17:11
different the sun itself is dramatically
17:14
different the sun's Corona is different
17:17
at each Eclipse because the corona is a
17:19
product of the sun's magnetic field and
17:23
that magnetic field is changing every
17:26
day so the details the fine structure in
17:29
the Suns coron is always different mhm
17:33
so every eclipses is dramatically
17:35
different the appearance of the sun's
17:37
Corona right if you look at one Renoir
17:40
it's not the same as the next one you're
17:42
describing the corona of each Eclipse as
17:44
its own work of art basically exactly
17:48
yeah so as you're chasing these eclipses
17:52
around the world what is the place of an
17:55
eclipse in your day-to-day academic
17:57
studies and soon enough your
17:59
professional work so I went to grad
18:01
school at University of Toledo and did
18:05
some work at the kit Peak National
18:07
Observatory learning the ins and outs of
18:09
photometric photometry that is measuring
18:11
the brightness of stars and eventually
18:14
this led to a job opening at the NASA
18:16
godded space flight center and I got
18:19
interested in the idea of predicting
18:21
eclipses and started studying the
18:24
mathematics of how to do this and I sort
18:27
of took it over on a officially and
18:29
started publishing these technical maps
18:31
and details and we published about a
18:33
dozen books through NASA on upcoming
18:36
eclipses people would just write me a
18:38
letter and say they wanted a copy of the
18:40
eclipse bulletin for such and such an
18:42
eclipse and I would stuff it in an
18:45
envelope and mail it to them so you take
18:47
it upon yourself to make sure that
18:50
everyone is going to know when the next
18:53
eclipse is coming yes and no doubt
18:55
during this period you keep going to
18:58
each and every eclipse and and I wonder
18:59
which of them stand out to you well I've
19:03
seen total eclipses from Australia from
19:07
Africa from the altiplanos in Bolivia
19:11
from the ice sheet on the coast of
19:13
Antarctica and even from uh northern
19:16
China on the edge of the GOI desert but
19:19
one of the most notable eclipses for me
19:21
was I traveled to India to see a 41
19:25
second Eclipse which was very short and
19:28
besides
19:29
seeing a great eclipse in India I also
19:32
met my future wife there she was on the
19:34
same trip well I have to hear that
19:37
story well she had been trying to see a
19:40
total eclipse for about 25 years wow she
19:44
tried to see the 1970 Eclipse but her
19:47
friends who were going to drive down
19:48
from Pennsylvania down to North Carolina
19:52
sort of talked her out of it at the 11th
19:54
Hour they talked her out of seeing the
19:56
same Eclipse that was your first total
19:59
eclipse that was so important to you yes
20:02
and they talked her out of it because
20:04
from Pennsylvania they were going to
20:05
have a maybe a 90% Eclipse they didn't
20:08
know any better they thought that was
20:09
good enough mhm and she regretted that
20:12
decision so then she said okay well I
20:15
got to get to the next total eclipse
20:17
which was in Quebec in
20:20
1972 the same one that was my second
20:23
eclipse and we were probably within 5
20:25
miles of each other in krec and we were
20:28
both clouded out right then she was
20:30
married she was raising kids she's got
20:32
busy with domestic life for 20 years she
20:35
became a widow so now 1995 there's this
20:40
41 second eclipse in India that is very
20:45
difficult to get to it's halfway around
20:46
the world but she's still itching to see
20:48
a total eclipse mhm and we join the same
20:53
Expedition a travel group of 30 Eclipse
20:56
Chasers and end up in India for the
20:58
eclipse and we have fantastic weather
21:00
it's
21:01
[Music]
21:04
perfect she was in tears after totality
21:07
she had been waiting so long to see it
21:10
and we struck up a friendship on that
21:12
trip by the time uh the 1998 Eclipse was
21:16
taking place in the Caribbean uh at that
21:19
point we were together we went to that
21:21
was our first Eclipse to observe uh as a
21:24
couple I think our wedding cake had a
21:27
big eclipse on the top of the
21:30
cake perfect we made a music CD for the
21:33
wedding that we played during the
21:34
reception and of course all the music on
21:37
on the CD had sun and moon themes to
21:40
[Laughter]
21:44
ittal Eclipse of the
21:47
Heart course had Total Eclipse of the
21:49
Heart was a must have had to had
21:57
to
21:59
it strikes me Fred that eclipses are
22:01
such an organizing principle in your
22:03
life your life seems to literally orbit
22:05
around them when you were a kid you
22:08
started planning for them years in
22:10
advance this work becomes Central to
22:13
your career it's how you meet your
22:17
wife and you said when I asked you about
22:22
each Eclipse that they're all different
22:25
and obviously you're different at each
22:27
Eclipse because time has has past your
22:30
life has changed and it just feels like
22:31
your life is being lived in a kind of
22:35
ongoing
22:36
conversation with this phenomenon of the
22:40
Sun and the Moon
22:42
overlapping well the eclipses are like
22:45
benchmarks that I can use to figure out
22:47
what else was going on in my life during
22:49
these times because I
22:52
remember the dates of every single
22:54
Eclipse I've been to and if I see a
22:57
photograph of the solar Corona shot
22:59
during any particular Eclipse I know
23:01
what Eclipse that was I can recognize
23:04
the pattern of the corona like a
23:05
fingerprint that's amazing and I know
23:07
the year of the eclipse it reminds me of
23:09
when Pat and I got married and between
23:12
which Eclipse we were getting married
23:13
and had the plan our wedding so it
23:15
didn't interfere with any kind of
23:17
eclipse
23:19
strips and uh they just serve as sort of
23:22
a benchmarks or markers for the rest of
23:25
my life of when various eclipses take
23:28
place place so they're easy for marking
23:30
the passage of time mhm so we are of
23:34
course talking to you a few days before
23:38
this year's Eclipse which I cannot
23:41
fathom you missing so where are you
23:44
planning to watch this total eclipse Pat
23:48
and I are leaving for uh Mazon Mexico
23:52
actually tomorrow and we've got about 80
23:54
people joining us down in masalon for
23:56
this eclipse in in our tour group
23:59
and for you of course this year's
24:01
eclipse is just the latest in a very
24:03
long line of eclipses but I think for
24:05
the rest of us and here I'm thinking
24:06
about
24:07
myself this is really going to be my
24:10
first total eclipse at least that I can
24:11
remember and for my two little kids it's
24:14
absolutely going to be their first and
24:17
given the hard-earned wisdom that you've
24:19
accumulated in all your Decades of
24:21
chasing eclipses around the world I
24:24
wonder if you can give us just a little
24:27
bit of advice
24:29
for how to best live inside this very
24:33
brief window of a total solar eclipse to
24:37
make sure not to be cliched but that we
24:40
make it count well I think one mistake
24:43
that people tend to make is getting
24:46
preoccupied with recording everything in
24:49
their lives what they had for lunch what
24:51
they had for dinner and seeing the
24:53
eclipse is something that you want to
24:56
witness firsthand try to be present in
24:59
seeing the eclipse in in the moment of
25:00
it so don't get preoccupied with
25:03
recording every instant of it um sit
25:05
back and try to take in the entire
25:07
experience because those several minutes
25:10
pass by so rapidly but you'll replay
25:13
them in your mind over and over and over
25:15
again and you don't want technology
25:17
getting between you and that experience
25:20
and remember to take your eclipse
25:21
glasses off when totality begins note
25:25
how dark it gets during totality take
25:27
the glasses off because
25:29
well the the glasses protect your eyes
25:31
from the sun's bright disc but when
25:35
totality Begins the sun's bright disc is
25:37
gone so if you use your solar eclipse
25:40
glasses to try to look at the corona you
25:41
won't see anything you'll just see
25:43
Blackness mhm you've got to remove the
25:46
eclipse glasses in order to see the
25:47
Corona and it's completely safe and it's
25:50
a an incredible sight to to behold but
25:53
during totality you just want to look
25:54
around without the glasses on and take
25:57
in the sights take in The Horizon
26:00
360Â° uh surrounding you with these
26:03
Twilight colors and sunset colors you'll
26:05
easily be able to see Jupiter and Venus
26:08
shining on either side of the Sun during
26:10
totality and look at the details in the
26:13
sun's Corona fine wispy textures and any
26:16
possible red prominences hugging against
26:19
the moon's disc during
26:24
totality and let's say it's now the
26:26
moment of totality and you Mr Eclipse
26:31
can whisper one thing into someone's ear
26:35
as they're watching what would you say
26:36
to
26:37
[Music]
26:39
them enjoy just take it all
26:45
in well Fred thank you very much we
26:48
really appreciate it well thank you I
26:50
hope everybody has some clear sky me
26:57

27:01
after today the next total solar eclipse
27:04
to be visible from the continental
27:06
United States will occur 20 years from
27:09
now in
27:11
2044 in other words you might as well
27:14
watch
27:18
today's we'll be right
27:24
back here's what else you need to
27:26
another day Israel has fired two
27:30
officers in connection with the deadly
27:32
air strike on Aid workers from the
27:34
world's Central Kitchen who were killed
27:37
last week while delivering food to
27:39
civilians in Gaza in a report released
27:42
on Friday Israel blamed their deaths on
27:45
a string of Errors made by the military
27:49
the air strike Israel said was based on
27:52
insufficient and incorrect evidence that
27:55
a passenger traveling with the workers
27:57
was
27:59
armed meanwhile Israel said it withdrew
28:03
a division of ground troops from
28:05
Southern Gaza on Sunday leaving no
28:08
soldiers actively patrolling the area
28:12
the move raises questions about Israel's
28:14
strategy as the war drags into its sixth
28:18
month in particular it casts doubt on
28:21
Israel's plans to invade Rafa gaza's
28:25
Southernmost city an invasion that the
28:27
United States states has asked Israel
28:29
not to carry out for fear of large scale
28:33
