An Engineering Experiment to Cool the Earth



0:00
from The New York Times I'm Katherine
0:02
benold this is the
0:05
[Music]
0:08
daily after failing for decades to cut
0:11
carbon emissions enough to stop the
0:13
planet from dangerously overheating
0:16
scientists are increasingly looking at
0:18
backup measures some that would fight
0:21
the warming by intervening in the
0:23
climate itself today my colleague
0:26
Christopher Fel on the efforts to
0:29
engineer are a way out of the climate
0:34
[Music]
0:35
[Applause]
0:37
[Music]
0:40
crisis it's Friday April
0:44
[Music]
0:49
5th so Chris you've been covering
Climate change
0:52
climate change for a while but recently
0:55
you've been focused on a very special
0:56
project tell us about this yeah two
0:59
things have been happening in climate
1:01
change recently that are really
1:02
important number one records have been
1:05
falling at alarming rates last year was
1:08
again the hottest year on record much
1:11
the world surpassed this sort of
1:14
important threshold of 1.5 degrees C
1:16
above pre-industrial levels so the world
1:20
is getting warmer at an alarming rate at
1:23
the same time emissions aren't falling
1:25
right the sort of the message of the
1:27
last generation has been we need need to
1:30
cut emissions really to almost zero by
1:34
the end of the century and in fact the
1:37
reverse is happening emissions are
1:39
continuing to rise at the same time the
1:42
number and characteristics of weather
1:45
disasters have become really alarming so
1:48
the effects of that warming have become
1:51
really clear and it's clear that the
1:52
world is struggling to adapt to those
1:56
effects so the other thing that's
1:57
happening is sort of a high level
2:00
is there's more research and more
2:02
consideration of okay what if we can't
2:04
cut emissions fast enough what if we're
2:07
going to have this really severe degree
2:10
of warming can we do something else
2:12
maybe temporarily to sort of buffer
2:15
those effects and that's led to this
2:18
question of What kinds of changes can we
2:21
make deliberately to the atmosphere to
2:24
the environment that will maybe produce
2:26
some sort of artificial Cooling in the
2:29
meantime
2:32
so earlier this week I was able to watch
2:34
as scientists did the first outdoor
2:37
tests in the US on a technology that
2:41
will aim to do just that it's called
2:44
Marine Cloud
2:48
brightening so what is this idea of
Cloud brightening
2:50
brightening the clouds where did it
2:52
originally come from so everyone I
2:55
talked to pointed back to one really
2:58
important moment in 1990 when a British
3:02
physicist named John leam was taking a
3:05
hike in Wales with his young son and
3:09
they were looking out at the clouds over
3:11
the Irish sea and as Dr leam later told
3:15
it his son asked him hey why are clouds
3:18
bright and Dam said well because they
3:22
reflect Sun back in the sky and his son
3:24
said so they're like soggy mirrors and
3:27
Dr leam went on to write a letter in
3:30
1990 that was published in the journal
3:32
Nature saying you know what if we can
3:36
deliberately manipulate these clouds
3:39
maybe we can make them more reflective
3:42
and actually counteract the effects of
3:46
global warming that was sort of the
3:48
Inception point for this idea and it led
3:51
to Decades of research culminating in
3:53
this week's test so the idea is if you
3:57
can make clouds more reflective you can
4:00
reflect more of the sun's heat back into
4:02
space so it won't get trapped in the
4:05
Earth's atmosphere in the first place
4:07
exactly that's what they're trying to
4:11
do that's a very simple and at the same
USS Hornet
4:13
time a very powerful idea I I love
4:16
actually that they were hiking in Wales
4:17
um that's where I am right now and we
4:20
sure have a lot of clouds here rain
4:22
clouds but tell me more about what you
4:25
saw at the testing side so this Tuesday
4:30
a little after 7 in the morning I pulled
4:33
up in a parking lot on a dock at the
4:36
edge of alam I'm standing at the gang
4:40
plank to the USS Hornet a decommissioned
4:44
aircraft carrier in San Francisco Bay
4:48
I'm here for the first test in the US of
4:54
a machine that was designed to try to
4:57
brighten clouds a way of
5:00
maybe temporarily cooling the Earth and
5:04
I made my way up one of the massive gang
5:10
planks and came in to find a cluster of
5:14
some of the top atmospheric scientists
5:17
in the world chis Sarah how do you
5:20
do how are you looking really excited
5:24
and they accompanied me out to the
5:27
flight deck here we are of this aircraft
5:32
carrier oh man pretty epic it is pretty
5:36
great which was a bit like a party
5:38
they'd set up you know a little table on
5:40
the side with some coffee and some
5:41
sandwiches and people were chatting and
5:44
saying hi to each other and I asked them
5:46
why they were excited so I know a
5:50
thousandth of what you know and I still
5:52
find this exciting are you guys like
5:53
walk me through is this like a big day
5:55
for you or just like one more test no
5:57
this is a big day for me and they said
6:00
this is actually a huge day in their
6:04
research just looking at it going yeah
6:05
this is culmination of years of work
6:07
right yeah not wow and tell me about
6:11
what exactly they were so excited about
6:13
and what they were doing on the ship
6:15
yeah the thing everyone was excited
6:17
about was this machine set up at the far
6:21
end of the flight deck of this aircraft
6:24
carrier it's blue it's shiny it looks a
6:27
bit like a snowmaker or maybe like a
6:29
spot lights this machine is a sprayer
6:32
what it does is it sprays really really
6:36
really small aerosol particles in this
6:40
case smashed up sea salt a long distance
6:43
at just the right size and just the
6:46
right volume because in theory at some
6:49
point you could use this machine to
6:51
change the size and number of the
6:54
droplets in the clouds you can make them
6:56
brighter conceptually it's possible the
6:58
question is
7:00
technologically can we do it yeah the
7:02
particles are coming out and super
7:03
concentrated there right so whatever's
7:06
coming out of that Circle there is
7:08
basically going to be huge by the time
7:11
it you know gets to the cloud okay so
7:13
and so the goal with this test was they
7:15
spent years building this sprayer that
7:18
can use really high pressured air to
7:20
sort of Smash salt particles into super
7:24
small bits about 1700 the size of a
7:28
human hair wow what they didn't know
7:31
until this week and they're trying to
7:32
find out right now once you spray it do
7:35
those aerosols that are so finely tuned
7:37
stay that size in theory they should
7:41
what they don't know is things like wind
7:44
and humidity and temperature could
7:46
potentially cause them to coagulate to
7:48
regroup which would throw the whole
7:50
thing off if the aerosols you're
7:52
shooting into clouds are too big you can
7:54
backfire the whole purpose you can wreck
7:56
what you're trying to do because you
7:57
make clouds less reflective not more
8:00
reflective so the whole goal this
8:01
experiment is okay can they make the
8:04
spray just so so that even in outdoor
8:07
conditions the aerosols that are so
8:10
finally sized Remain the size you want
8:13
them to be and that's what they're
8:14
trying to find out and you watched the
8:17
actual test of this what did you see
8:19
what happened those instruments are
8:22
emitting a slate
8:24
hum so operating the sprayer is not
8:28
straightforward
8:31
and they are filling the tanks with the
8:33
salt water that be used to produce the
8:37
Mist there was somebody crouched on the
8:41
control deck the panel of instruments
8:44
the at the side of the sprayer so I I
8:46
went over and tried to sit next to him
8:49
and watch him as he turned a series of
8:51
knobs in careful sequence okay yeah
8:54
everybody we're going to we're going to
8:55
run some air so the M we need 2 minutes
8:59
here just to have power on the and after
9:04
a series of tests to make sure the
9:05
valves were clear okay your protection
9:08
please finally the moment
9:12
came and he got an all clear over his
9:15
walki talkie and he turned on the
9:19
water water on copy over and the
9:24
[Applause]
9:27
air since the sound of the compressor
9:30
it pushes pressurized air through the
9:33
sprayer it's making a sort of a dull
9:35
throbbing sensation you can feel it a
9:37
little bit through the deck of the
9:40
ship we all had ear protectors and even
9:43
with the ear protectors it was really
9:44
loud and then you could almost feel this
9:48
spray bursting out of this machine and
9:51
watch it travel really hundreds of feet
9:54
down the deck of the aircraft
9:57
carrier okay water off and off good
10:02
job awesome guys you're done thank you
10:06
excellent first test is
10:10
done my first signal that things had
10:12
gone well was I looked up when the spray
10:14
machine was turned off and saw some
10:16
scientists high-fiving down the
10:18
deck what' you
10:20
think it's
10:22
beautiful is it what you thought it
10:24
would be it's
10:27
better and
10:30
I'm optimistic that it will tell us a
10:32
lot
10:33
about what these things
10:36
do this is made me really
10:39
optimistic and the idea is to
10:43
dos and everyone seemed really excited
10:46
that this thing they' worked on for
10:48
years was finally happening in this
10:52
really important outdoor test okay so it
10:55
sounds like this test was a success
10:57
right yeah they stress that they need a
10:59
lot of time to really go over the
11:02
results they'll be doing this test again
11:04
and again in different weather
11:05
conditions but the initial reaction
11:08
seemed positive they seemed to think
11:10
that the numbers they were getting were
11:11
what they were hoping to see and so now
11:13
the goal is can they maintain the right
11:16
siiz aerosols even in different
11:18
conditions down the deck of this
11:20
aircraft carrier that'll give them some
11:22
confidence that if they decided one day
11:24
to try and do this on the open ocean to
11:26
actually brighten clouds they'd have the
11:28
ability to do
When to use it
11:30
so Chris if all of this works how and
11:33
when do these researchers anticipate
11:36
that this would actually be
11:38
used well here's a great example in the
11:40
month of February a version of this
11:43
testing was also happening in Australia
11:45
off the coast of Australia where
11:47
researchers were testing whether Marine
11:49
Cloud brightening could be used to cool
11:52
the ocean just a little bit around the
11:54
Great Barrier Reef really high ocean
11:56
temperatures are causing bleaching of
11:58
that Coral Reef the idea was could they
12:01
use Marine Cloud brightening to save
12:04
some of those reefs from dying and
12:06
that's probably a good idea of the sort
12:08
of Fairly localized situation where you
12:12
could in theory if you do it right have
12:14
a fairly quick degree of cooling that
12:18
could maybe try to avert or mitigate
12:21
something pretty acute like a heat wave
12:24
or or a stretch of warm weather that
12:25
would kill Coral but the science is
12:27
probably too knew at this point to sort
12:31
of talk about the right
12:33
situations to use it those conversations
12:36
are all down the road as researchers
12:38
look at these and other ideas for what
12:41
they could do if things get really
12:49
[Music]
12:52
bad we'll be right
12:54
[Music]
12:58
back
13:00
[Music]
Solutions
13:13
so Chris when I think about solutions to
13:15
climate change you know it usually
13:17
involves these very hard things we need
13:19
to do like you know change the way we
13:20
live the way we drive what we eat we
13:23
need these International treaties we
13:25
need carbon taxes regulation there's
13:27
lots of hard stuff and we haven't gotten
13:29
that far but here you've just told me
13:31
about this technology that if it ends up
13:34
working could actually help cool the
13:36
planet without anyone needing to do any
13:39
of these hard things it sounds
13:42
great it does sound great now we got to
13:45
say first of all that whenever anybody
13:48
working on this stuff talks about it the
13:49
first thing they say is this is not an
13:52
alternative to reducing emissions this
13:54
is looking for ways to buy time as we
13:59
try to cut emissions there's no way to
14:02
really deal with climate change that
14:04
doesn't entail burning less fossil fuel
14:07
and quickly but yes in addition to
14:10
brightening clouds there's other ways of
14:12
try to bounce more sunlight back into
14:15
space and other ideas my colleague David
14:18
gallis wrote the first piece in our
14:21
series looking the idea of removing
14:23
carbon dioxide directly from the air
14:26
sort of reversing our past emissions
14:29
other ideas include finding ways to suck
14:33
up more of the CO2 in the oceans there
14:37
even ideas that my colleague car Buckley
14:40
covered of could we build a sort of a
14:42
giant parasol way out in space that
14:45
would reflect or scatter more of the
14:48
sunlight and prevent some of that
14:49
sunlight from even reaching the Earth in
14:52
the first place wow so there's there's a
14:54
huge number of ideas that until very
14:57
recently seemed just so bizarre and or
15:00
so expensive and or so dangerous that
15:04
they were hardly worth pursuing
15:06
seriously and what's changed really
15:08
quickly in the last really year or two
15:11
is all of a sudden those ideas have
15:13
switched from being too wild to spend
15:17
much time on to being so important
15:21
because situation is so dire that we
15:23
can't not look at them and that's the
15:26
pivot that my team has has been trying
15:29
to cover and what characterizes all
Geoengineering
15:32
these initiatives is that rather than
15:34
reducing our own emissions we're now
15:36
trying to intervene in the climate in a
15:39
proactive way engineering the climate in
15:42
a way yes and you hear the phrase
15:45
geoengineering to describe these ideas
15:48
sort of collectively and what people who
15:50
research this will stress is we're
15:52
already geoengineering right for more
15:55
than a century we've been geoengineering
15:58
in the sense of
15:59
putting climate changing pollution into
16:03
the atmosphere that's caused the planet
16:05
to change by trapping more heat in the
16:07
atmosphere so the question is do we want
16:10
to deliberately geoengineer in a way
16:13
that will ease that pressure rather than
16:16
just making it worse of course there's
16:19
some controversy attached to this and
16:22
there there are some pretty valid
16:25
concerns about what the consequences
16:28
might be if we keep on pursuing these
16:30
ideas and why are they controversial
16:34
well the first concern that you hear is
16:36
this idea of moral hazard that if people
16:39
come to think that there are ways of
16:41
addressing climate change that don't
16:43
require them to change their lifestyle
16:46
or sacrifice conveniences or change the
16:49
kinds of cars they drive or how their
16:51
their powers generated that they will
16:53
lose interest in those tough changes and
16:57
the sort of momentum such as it is
17:00
towards cutting emissions will fade even
17:03
more but we don't know yet whether
17:06
politicians or governments or companies
17:08
or just people will sort of misuse these
17:11
ideas to try to Sherk the harder work of
17:17
reducing the amount of greenhouse gases
17:20
we emit another really important
17:22
argument you hear is okay side effects
17:25
do we really know what would happen if
17:29
we try these things Marine Cloud
17:30
brightening is one of those situations
17:33
where there are known unknowns and
17:36
unknown unknowns as they say the known
17:39
unknowns are well what would happen to
17:41
things like ocean circulation what would
17:43
happen to precipitation what would
17:45
happen to the effect on the amount of
17:48
energy reaching the ocean what would
17:50
happen to the Fisheries industry we
17:53
don't really know and research are
17:55
trying to find out what those effects
17:58
might be then there are the unknown
18:00
unknowns if you start deliberately
18:02
changing the cloud system well what else
18:06
might happen that we haven't anticipated
18:08
do you move the location of where
18:11
rainfall happens do you perhaps upset
18:13
the monsoon cycle in India do you change
18:16
the ability to grow food in parts of the
18:18
world so if you do this at a bigger
18:20
scale the consequences of those
18:23
potential side effects get more and more
18:25
severe and I talked to environmentalists
18:28
who said that's a real concern you just
18:30
can't model those risks and you sort of
18:33
to a degree by pursuing this have to
18:36
accept that that risk is real and almost
18:39
roll the dice and I guess much like
Unintended Consequences
18:41
climate change where you have a group of
18:43
countries that is most responsible for
18:47
CO2 emissions that have caused the
18:48
global warming and then a whole other
18:50
group of countries that are probably
18:51
suffering the worst consequences even
18:53
though they haven't contributed to those
18:55
emissions nearly as much you might see a
18:58
situation where this kind of
19:00
interference with the climate at the
19:02
initiative of some countries presumably
19:04
the wealthy countries that have that
19:05
technology would then have unintended
19:07
consequences in countries that have no
19:09
control over this so that's tricky
19:13
that's right and that takes us to sort
19:14
of a third category of concerns which is
19:17
okay let's assume that things are bad
19:19
enough that collectively societies won't
19:22
take those risks of those side effects
19:25
well then who chooses like who decides
19:28
when we get that point is there even a
19:30
mechanism that would allow you to get
19:32
sort of informed consent from everybody
19:34
who'd be affected and if these would
19:36
affect everybody it's hard to imagine
19:39
how you would build a governance
19:41
mechanism that would allow you to say
19:43
before we push the button are we sure
19:46
everybody's okay with this the only
19:48
counter to all of these concerns is
19:51
compared to what right and this is the
19:53
point that researchers make okay this is
19:55
dangerous okay it presents challenges
19:57
but compared to what their point is
19:59
don't compare it to a situation where
20:02
everything's fine compare it to a
20:03
situation where we're actually in where
20:06
the trajectory of global warming is so
20:09
serious and isn't looking like it'll get
20:12
better anytime soon well compared to
20:14
those risks how do these risks compare
20:17
right and the question is would you
20:19
rather have a world of basically
20:21
uncontrolled warming and we have an idea
20:24
of what that brings wildfires and
20:26
drought and sea level rise and Stor
20:28
forms and diseases is that better than
20:31
some of these more perhaps controlled
20:34
risks associated with deliberately
20:36
tinkering with the environment so it's
20:39
almost like pick your poison what sort
20:41
of threats do you want to embrace and
20:44
that's the overwhelming dilemma that we
20:46
face with this
Overwhelming Dilemma
20:48
technology in a way what it makes me
20:50
think is that these crazy initiatives
20:53
that we've been hearing about from you
20:54
are yes they're Testament to our failure
20:57
in a way to combat CL climate change so
20:59
far because you know there's such a last
21:01
resort really such a sort of an act of
21:03
desperation but at the same time it
21:05
seems like this urgency has actually
21:07
Unleashed a lot of energy and money to
21:11
tackle the problem yeah and and there's
21:14
good news in this the good news is the
21:15
research we're talking about
21:17
demonstrates the really amazing capacity
21:20
of scientists to come up with new ideas
21:23
develop new technologies test them
21:25
quickly and at least build some options
21:28
right so like there's any if there's any
21:30
raise of Hope around climate change it's
21:32
that Humanity's capacity to innovate and
21:37
find new ideas is almost endless so the
21:41
question is not are we sort of pursuing
21:44
the wrong research ideas and question is
21:48
can we find good ideas fast enough to
21:51
revert the really serious consequences
21:55
of climate change that we're already
21:57
facing Chris I just remember that
Optimism
22:01
scientist we heard in the tape from your
22:03
visit and she was so excited and she
22:06
said that she was really
22:08
optimistic I wonder how are you
22:15
feeling I I think the frustration that
22:17
you'll hear among climate reporters when
22:20
I'm in this group is
22:22
that most people seem not to appreciate
22:26
the severity of the situation that we're
22:29
in there seems to be a view that we're
22:31
dealing with this you know people are
22:33
buying electric cars and we're getting
22:35
more solar power and wind power and
22:37
things are going the right way and this
22:39
will be okay things are not going the
22:41
right way not only are we on the wrong
22:45
trajectory in terms of missions we are
22:48
so far away from being on the right
22:50
trajectory for Missions that it's hard
22:52
to imagine us cutting emissions globally
22:55
at a rate anywhere near fast enough to
22:57
avoid
22:59
almost unbearable consequences of global
23:01
warming so that's the
23:04
downside here here's the good news
23:06
though I do think and this again I think
23:08
is a view among other climate reporters
23:10
the
23:11
capacity of scientists and of companies
23:16
to change track and to find new products
23:19
and apply new ideas is really impressive
23:23
right it just doesn't feel like there's
23:26
a connection yet between the the urgency
23:29
of the situation and the way people and
23:32
companies and governments are
23:34
[Music]
23:36
responding and so I guess if the
23:38
question is how I feel about this I I am
23:41
constantly amazed at the Ingenuity of
23:43
the researchers I come across in my job
23:45
every day what I don't yet know about is
23:50
whether or not Society will move fast
23:54
enough to adopt and apply those ideas
23:58
before the conditions that we Face from
24:01
climate change become almost
24:04
[Music]
24:19
unbearable well quis on this cautiously
24:22
optimistic note thank you very much
24:25
thank
24:27
you
24:28
[Music]
24:32
we'll be right
24:36
back here's what else you need to know
24:39
today in a tense phone call with
24:41
Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu on
24:43
Thursday President Biden called the air
24:45
strikes that killed seven Aid workers
24:47
this week unacceptable and threatened to
24:50
condition future support for Israel on
24:53
how it addresses concerns about civilian
24:55
casualties and the humanitarian crisis
24:57
in Gaza
24:59
it was the first time that Biden
25:00
explicitly sought to leverage American
25:03
Aid to influence Israel's conduct of the
25:05
war against Hamas but the White House
25:08
stopped short of saying directly that
25:10
the president would halt arm supplies or
25:12
impose conditions on their use as some
25:15
fellow Democrats have urged him to do
25:17
and a Centrist group called No Labels
25:21
has abandoned its plans to run a
25:22
presidential ticket in this year's
25:24
election after failing to recruit a
25:27
candidate the group which last year said
25:30
it raised $60 million had planned to put
25:33
forward what it called a bipartisan
25:35
Unity ticket in the event of a rematch
25:38
between President Biden and former
25:40
president Trump but in recent months
25:42
suffered a string of rejections from
25:44
prominent Republicans and Democrats who
25:47
declined to run on its
25:53
ticket today's episode was produced by
