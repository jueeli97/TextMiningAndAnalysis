Kick Trump Off the Ballot? Even Liberal Justices Are Skeptical



0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael babbaro this is the daily We are following breaking news the Colorado Supreme Court
0:08
has ruled that former president Donald Trump will be left off the state's primary and presidential ballots in
0:16
December the Colorado Supreme Court issued a bombshell rule this is a historic decision it's a momentous
0:22
decision as that said Donald Trump was ineligible to be on the state's ballot
0:28
for the Republican Presidential Prime because of his alleged role in the January 6th Insurrection because it
0:34
found he had engaged in Insurrection on January 6 it's based on a little known
0:39
provision that bars people who have engaged in an Insurrection from holding government office which according to the
0:46
14th Amendment disqualifies him from serving as president it states that
0:51
anyone engaging in Insurrection cannot hold public office but this is
0:56
unprecedented constitutional territory y'all
1:05
this Civil War era constitutional provision could knock the leading
1:11
candidate of one of the two major political parties off the
1:16
ballot at the time we turned to our colleague Adam lipac who covers the
1:21
Supreme Court for the times to help us understand the meaning of that decision
1:27
and what could happen next this really needs to be an issue that is resolved on
1:32
a nationwide basis M meaning it has to go to the Supreme Court and it would be
1:38
shocking if the Supreme Court would not wait in and issue a ruling on this
1:43
question that you know a decade ago would been impossible to imagine just as Adam predicted the
1:50
Supreme Court did take the case and on Thursday the justices heard Arguments
1:57
for and against keeping Trump off the ballot in
2:04
Colorado today we turn to Adam once again to
2:09
analyze those arguments and the responses from the justices and what they reveal about how the high court is
2:16
likely to rule in a case that could alter the course of this year's race for
2:27
president it's Friday February
2:33
[Music]
2:40
9th Adam I really like your what do the kids call it your fit thank you I like
2:45
your I like your shirt it's a very it's a very handsome business casual kind of thing going on there it's barely
2:51
business but it is [Laughter] casual okay so Adam the clock strikes 10
2:58
a.m. or so this morning Thursday and the Supreme Court begins to hear this
3:04
momentous case take us into the room so this is the biggest election case since at least Bush Vore the 2000 decision
3:11
that handed the presidency to George W bush and now the question is whether
3:16
Donald Trump is eligible to be on the ballot in Colorado but really all Across
3:22
the Nation Under a provision of the Constitution that says if you've sworn
3:28
an oath to support the con stitution and then engage in Insurrection you may not
3:34
hold any office the court had put the case on an exceptionally Fast Track
3:39
partly because ballots in Colorado are going out in a matter of days super Tuesday is almost upon us and the nation
3:47
needs an answer to whether the leading candidate of one of the political parties is even eligible to hold office
3:55
right and Colorado of course is one of the super Tuesday States that's going to be holding a Republican primary on March
4:02
5th that's right so the courtroom of course just across the street from the capital where in January 6
4:09
2021 there was the cataclysmic assault on the seat of our government and you
4:16
might think that that would have occupied a substantial part of the argument right given what this case is
4:22
about right that question of was it an Insurrection did Donald Trump inight
4:28
engage in that ins Direction and although those topics were not wholly
4:34
absent from the argument they came up in passing a couple times that really was
4:39
not the focus of the argument this was a legal argument about how the Constitutional provision in this case
4:46
works okay well let's then talk about the arguments made around that we'll
4:53
hear argument this morning in case 23719 Trump versus Anderson Mr Mitchell
4:58
so there two basic arguments in the case Mr chief justice and may it please the court Jonathan Mitchell Trump's lawyer
5:05
stands up the Colorado Supreme Court's decision is wrong and should be reversed for numerous independent reasons he
5:12
starts off with his lead argument which is a very close reading of section three
5:18
of the 14th amendment that the Colorado Supreme Court used to say that Trump is
5:25
not eligible to be president again MH the first reason is that President Trump
5:30
is not covered by section three because the president is not an officer of the
5:36
United States as that term is used throughout the Constitution it probably helps Michael to parse through the words
5:43
and there are three different ideas embedded in the amendment there's first of all who does it apply to and it says
5:52
you have to have previously taken an oath as a member of Congress or as an
5:57
officer of the United States or as a member of any state legislature
6:03
or as an executive or judicial officer of any state officer of the United
6:08
States refers only to appointed officials and it does not Encompass
6:13
elected individuals such as the president or members of Congress and he argues that you can't fit the president
6:20
into the phrase an officer of the United States that those are appointed not
6:26
elected officials so that's his first texture argument about who it applies to
6:32
Second textual argument what offices does it apply to and here I'm going to read a different part of the section it
6:40
says no person shall be a senator or representative in Congress or elector of
6:46
president and vice president or hold any office civil or military under the
6:52
United States you'll notice the president is not mentioned by name although he would seem to hold an office
6:59
civil or military but there are arguments again that that doesn't apply
7:04
and then there's the phrase hold any office and Mitchell says because even if
7:10
the candidate is an admitted insurrectionist Section 3 still allows the candidate to run for office and even
7:16
win election to office you can't hold an office but it doesn't say you can't run
7:21
for office it doesn't say you can't be elected to office so if a state banned
7:27
even an admitted insurrectionist from the ballot it would be adding to an altering the Constitution's qualifications for office
7:34
because under section three and he takes some additional comfort from the last
7:39
Clause of Section 3 is that section 3 cannot be used to exclude a presidential
7:45
candidate from the ballot even if that candidate is disqualified from serving as president under section three because
7:52
Congress can lift that disability after the candidate is elected but before he
7:57
takes office so he's says even someone who is disqualified can run can be elected
8:05
because the moment before Inauguration Day Congress can say by a two-thirds vote of each house that the person is
8:12
eligible after all so it's not lawful to Bar someone from the candidacy when at
8:19
least in theory Congress can make you eligible right up to the point of inauguration and in this situation A
8:26
ruling from this court that affirms the decision below would not not only violate term limits but take away the
8:31
votes of potentially tens of millions of Americans I welcome the Court's questions okay so this admittedly is
8:37
very technical but there are three things going on here right first Trump's lawyer is saying that this doesn't apply
8:45
to presidents or former presidents because they're not mentioned specifically in this rule secondly he's
8:52
saying it doesn't prevent anyone from seeking the office of the presidency
8:58
because that office isn't specifically mentioned in this Rule and finally it
9:03
doesn't say anything about barring people from running for office it only
9:09
bars people from holding certain offices so for all of those reasons Trump's
9:15
lawyer is saying this doesn't apply to Trump and that the Colorado Supreme Court in its finding has been wrong
9:22
that's right Mr Murray Mr chief justice and may it please the court he Jason
9:29
Murray the lawyer for the six Colorado voters challenging Trump's eligibility
9:34
says all of that is wrong he says section three disqualifies all oath-breaking insurrectionists except a
9:42
former president who never before held other state or federal office there is
9:47
no possible rationale for such an exemption that it would be an insane way
9:53
to interpret the Constitutional provision to exclude the most important office in the land and the highest
10:01
executive official of the United States from a provision meant to safeguard
10:07
democracy from Insurrection Section 3 uses deliberately broad language to
10:12
cover all positions of federal power requiring an oath to the Constitution he
10:18
also makes the point that section 3 is similar to other kinds of qualifications
10:23
to be president states are allowed to safeguard their ballots by excluding those who are underage foreign born you
10:31
have to be 35 years old you have to be a natural born citizen of the United
10:36
States he's saying use your common sense justices this does apply to the president that's pretty clear
10:44
yeah under Article 2 and the 10th Amendment states have the power to ensure that their citizens electoral
10:51
votes are not wasted on a candidate who is constitutionally barred from holding office he says it's crazy way to run a
10:59
system that people can vote for Donald Trump and not know whether their vote is going to count depending on whether his
11:08
current disqualification from running for office is perhaps lifted by Congress
11:13
and not only by Congress by a 2third vote of each house which is a little
11:19
hard to imagine we are here because for the first time since the War of 1812 our
11:26
nation's capital came under violent assault for the first time in history the attack
11:32
was incited by a sitting president of the United States to disrupt the peaceful transfer of Presidential Power
11:40
I welcome the Court's questions and how do the justices Adam respond to these two clashing claims of this close
11:48
reading of the 14th amendment by a lawyer for Trump and a lawyer for the Colorado voters so at first it seems like the justices are going to divide
11:54
along predictable lines with conservative justices like Neil Gorsuch
12:00
and Samuel oo being open to this kind of close textual reading Mr stepping back
12:06
on this a lot hinges on the difference between in your argument between the
12:11
term office and officer yes and I I I guess I'm wondering what theory do you
12:18
have from an original understanding or a textualist perspective why those two
12:24
terms so closely related would carry such different weight and some of the Liberals seemed skeptical of Trump's
12:31
lawyer argument Justice Kagan and if I could just understand Justice Kagan for instance kind of throws up her saying
12:37
you know if they had thought about it what reason would they have given for that rule and it does seem as though
12:43
there's no particular reason and you can think of lots of reasons for the contrary to say that the only people who
12:50
have engaged in Insurrection who are not disqualified from Office are presidents
12:56
who have not held high office before why would that rule exist let's be serious here it can't be that the president is
13:05
not included in these catch all all-encompassing phrases on something so
13:10
important point and is there any better reason for saying that an insurrectionist cannot hold the whole
13:16
panoply of offices in the United States but we're perfectly fine with that
13:22
Insurrection as being president I think that's an even tougher argument for us to make Justice son or I just want to p
13:29
your principal argument on section three and justce Sonia Sor another liberal
13:35
makes the interesting point your principal argument is that the president is not an officer of the United States
13:42
correct yeah I would say it a little more forcefully than what your honor just described bit of a Jerry mandard
13:47
rule isn't it designed to benefit only your client that this argument seems to
13:53
be as she put it Jerry mandard to favor Donald Trump i s wouldn't call it Jerry
13:59
Mander that implies nefarious you didn't make it you remember that list of
14:04
offices we discussed I do every other president falls into one of the named
14:11
offices Joe Biden was a Senator Bill Clinton was a governor right Donald
14:17
Trump though didn't serve in any previous official government capacity he was a businessman and then he became
14:25
president virtually every other president except Washington has taken a oath of to support the
14:31
Constitution correct that's right and with the possible exception of George Washington every other president fits
14:38
into one of those other slots so we have an argument here that's kind of a ticket for one ride only applies only to Donald
14:45
Trump right and so of's point is that's a little too cute by half that you're coming up with an argument that applies
14:51
to only one of our many presidents or perhaps two but the first one being the first when there really wasn't much of a
14:57
president to think about that's right that gives you a sense of how technical
15:02
historical originalist that part of the argument was thank you justice Jackson
15:08
going back to um whether the presidency is one of the barred offices I I guess and then in a little bit of a surprise
15:15
it turns out that not everyone is so predictable Justice katangi Brown Jackson the third liberal says it might
15:22
actually make sense to her to exclude the presidency from section three why um
15:29
I didn't see any evidence that the presidency was top of mine for the framers when they were drafting uh
15:35
Section 3 because they were actually dealing with a different issue um the pressing concern at least as I see the
15:43
historical record was actually what was going on at lower levels of the government the she says the people who
15:49
adopted it were concerned with the possibility of insurrectionist infiltrating state government and that
15:58
former Confederates would return to power in the South either in local offices or as Representatives but not
16:05
that the national office the president elected by the entire nation would
16:10
conceivably be a former Confederate Congress and that's a very different lens if your concern is trying to make
16:17
sure that these people don't come back through the state apparatus and control the government in that direction seems
16:24
to me very different than the worry that an insurrectionist will seize control of the entire national government through
16:30
the presidency so suddenly it looks like justice Jackson is also perhaps an originalist A textualist on this court
16:38
correct and at her confirmation hearing she held herself out to be an originalist and many people particularly
16:45
on the right scoffed but she has in her brief tenure on the court occasionally
16:51
shown strong originalist impulses right and somewhat unexpectedly that seems to be leading her to
16:59
bolster an argument from Trump's lawyer here on whether or not this amendment
17:06
really does apply to Trump right specifically mentioned the presidency and the vice presidency but it wasn't
17:11
but it wasn't the final it was the final it wasn't yes I'm sorry it wasn't the final enactment but it does show that
17:17
there was some concern by some people about Confederate insurrectionists ascending to the presidency and we
17:22
didn't want to make a law office history type argument we just so in listening to arguments on this first point the main
17:30
point pressed by Donald Trump's lawyers it seemed like there was the beginning
17:35
of the possibility of a scrambled lineup and as other issues were discussed in
17:43
the case that possibility seemed only to [Music]
17:57
grow we'll be right back so Adam right before the break we
18:04
covered the first issue in this hearing and the Justice's responses were
18:09
ideologically confusing as you said what happens with the second big issue in
18:14
this hearing the second question is whether individual states are entitled
18:20
to disqualify presidential candidates MH and a state cannot exclude any candidate
18:27
for federal office from the ballot on account of Section 3 Jonathan Mitchell
18:32
Trump's lawyer presses this point also unless and until Congress enacts implementing legislation allowing it to
18:39
do so so under and says Congress has to act and we can't have one state here and
18:45
one state there disqualifying candidates is that only Congress can provide the
18:50
means of enforcing section three well what would such congressional action look like what is he referring to you
18:56
could imagine Congress enacting a law saying here's what rights states do and
19:03
don't have in making these determinations just setting some ground
19:08
rules but then president Trump's other Arguments for reversal ignore the Constitutional role of the states Jason
19:16
Murray the lawyer for the Colorado voters says that's backwards states are
19:22
allowed to safeguard their ballots by excluding those who are underage foreign
19:27
born running for a third presidential term or as here those who have engaged
19:33
in Insurrection against the constitution in violation of their oath that the constitution of signed
19:39
States the substantial role of conducting Federal elections and this is
19:47
part of that role it is kind of common knowledge and we especially learned it in 2020 when President Trump tried to
19:53
overturn the election results at the state level that states very PR much are
19:59
responsible for elections in this country even Federal elections even the presidential election that's right okay
20:05
so what do the justices think about both of these arguments being made about
20:11
whether a state like Colorado can try to knock someone like Trump off the ballot
20:16
the justices are very wary of giving this power in this context to individual
20:23
states I mean the whole point of the 14th amendment was to restrict state power right States chief justice Roberts
20:31
says the whole point of the 14th Amendment after all adopted after the
20:36
Civil War adopted after states seceded from the Union was to restrict state
20:42
power to augment Federal power so wouldn't that be the last place that
20:47
you'd look for authorization for the States including Confederate states uh
20:53
to enforce the presidential election process that that seems he's saying the
20:58
14th Amendment is at odds with the very idea of giving states such a power that's right no your honor first we
21:06
would locate the state's authority to run presidential elections not in the 14th Amendment but in Article 2 and that
21:12
power so Jason Murray the lawyer for the challengers says that's the wrong way to think about it that states have
21:19
authority to run presidential elections it's not located in the 14th Amendment it's located in Article 2 of The
21:26
Constitution far as article two give States this broad power to determine how their electors are selected and that
21:32
broad power implies the narrower power to enforce federal constitutional qualifications but the narrower power
21:39
and then Justice Alo counil what do you do with the what I would seem to me to
21:45
be plain consequences of your position picks up on another aspect of the
21:51
question if Colorado's uh position is upheld surely there will be
21:56
disqualification proceedings on the other side and some of those will
22:01
succeed some of them will have it could result in kind of the wild west of
22:08
voting where different states would not only use different standards to decide
22:14
whether Donald Trump was on or off of their ballot but perhaps knock President
22:20
Biden off the ballot for supposed insurrectionary crimes of his own
22:26
correct I would expect that uh you know a goodly number of states will say uh
22:31
whoever the Democratic candidate is you're off the ballot and others uh for the Republican candidate you're off the
22:38
ballot and it'll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election that's
22:43
a pretty daunting consequence well certainly you're honor the and having
22:49
this kind of back and forth Mayhem would be a recipe for disaster in a democracy
22:56
just Kagan Mr Mary you talked um you relied on the uh State's extensive
23:01
powers under the electors and then even Justice Kagan says really that like
23:08
what's a state doing deciding who gets to who other citizens get to vote for
23:15
for president the Practical effect of allowing Colorado to Bar Trump from the
23:22
ballot affects voters in other states Colorado is not deciding who other states get to vote for for president
23:29
it's deciding how to assign its own electors under its Article 2 power and the Constitution grants them that that
23:36
is obvious yes no your honor because different states can have what do we think kagan's
23:42
specific fear is when she argues that letting Colorado take Trump off the
23:47
ballot will affect other people's voting she seems to be saying outside of
23:54
Colorado I guess it could mean one of two things or maybe more things it could
24:00
mean that it just affects the balance of power across the Electoral
24:05
College and makes it less likely that the candidate someone in Texas or New
24:11
Jersey wants to support is going to win because the Colorado votes drop out it
24:17
may also mean that if Colorado knocks Trump off the ballot other states will
24:24
feel persuaded that they should do the same thing that's said the lawyer for
24:30
the voters Jason Murray doesn't get it he says Colorado is not deciding who
24:35
other states get to vote for for president it's deciding how to assign its own electors in the Electoral
24:42
College that's just a function of state's power to enforce uh to preserve their own electors and avoid
24:49
disenfranchisement of their own citizens thank you and then what about the idea
24:54
that um we should think about democracy think about the right of the people to
24:59
elect uh candidates of their choice Justice Kavanaugh also raises his
25:06
own concerns about disenfranchisement does that come in when we think about should we read section three this way or
25:13
read it that way what about the background principle if you agree of democracy I'd like to make three points
25:19
on that Justice Kavanaugh the first is that constitutional safeguards are for the purpose of safeguarding our
25:24
democracy not just Jason Murray responds that section 3 is designed to protect
25:31
democracy this case illustrates the danger of refusing to apply Section 3 as written because the reason we're here is
25:38
that President Trump tried to disenfranchise 80 million Americans who voted against him and the Constitution
25:44
doesn't require that he be given another chance thank you so you had Murray trying very hard to convince them
25:51
otherwise but nonetheless both Justice Kavanaugh a
25:56
conservative and Justice Kagan a liberal seem to be worried about the potential
26:03
that a ruling that would knock Donald Trump off the ballot would amount to a kind of
26:09
disenfranchisement right and when we start to do the math here it's not just Justice Jackson anymore who is
26:15
surprising us as a liberal Justice skeptical of Colorado's argument for keeping Trump off the ballot we now have
26:21
at least two of the liberal justices saying this might not hold up as the
26:29
argument goes forward it seems that there are probably eight
26:36
justices prepared to keep Trump on the ballot and the only wild card and it
26:41
could end up being unanimous but the only wild card is Justice Soto myor H
26:47
Adam if eight justices agree that Trump should be allowed to be on the ballot in Colorado that would be kind of
26:52
Staggering given the nature of this case it would also be kind of Staggering given the nature of this court
26:59
that's right and this is a court that has been battered and questions have been raised about its legitimacy and
27:05
authority and Prestige and I think the justices might view this as an
27:11
opportunity to rebuild to come together to find consensus and particularly in an issue
27:20
where a contrary ruling one that would knock a leading presidential candidate
27:26
off the ballot would give rise to a very tough reaction from half the country
27:34
Adam it's possible of course that what you're saying is right but the justices have done kind of political analysis
27:39
here and decided they want to be on the same page and that page is to let voters have Choice keep Trump on the ballot but
27:45
is it also possible that at the end of the day what many people saw as a strong legal case being presented by the
27:51
Colorado voters and their lawyer just turned out to be weaker once it got to
27:56
the highest court in front of the nation's preeminent jurists and started to kind of crumble most legal Scholars
28:05
think that the case against Donald Trump is very strong the court for various
28:12
reasons good faith legal ones political calculations concerns about the
28:18
consequences of a ruling were always likely to be looking for an exit ramp it
28:24
looks like they've found one and that that exit ramp will be embraced by a
28:32
substantial majority maybe even all of the justices but that doesn't undermine the
28:39
purely theoretical question of does section 3 apply to Donald Trump's
28:46
conduct it is a reflection of kind of a a Judicial reality of a court that has
28:52
been under some substantial stress not wanting to use what what political
28:58
Capital it has left on this particular cause well for those who see what Trump
29:05
did on January 6th as disqualifying for the presidency the Colorado effort to
29:11
keep him off the ballot was very meaningful and it was in many of their eyes justifiable and if the Supreme
29:18
Court rules that Trump can't be held off the ballot it will have eliminated a major route by which American voters can
29:26
hold Trump accountable for trying to overturn the results of a free and fair
29:31
election yeah I don't want to unell that point at all if the court rules as I
29:38
expected to it will be a stinging loss for opponents of Donald Trump who saw
29:44
what happened on January 6th who consider it a vile Insurrection that he
29:53
incited and in the face of a constitution provision that it is
29:59
Child's Play to read as applying to him all of that is true but of course this
30:05
isn't the only Trump case Trump is the subject of numerous criminal
30:10
prosecutions including most notably a federal case arising from some of these
30:17
same events right and that case will soon be at the Supreme Court probably
30:22
next week in the form of a request from Donald Trump
30:28
that he be deemed absolutely immune from Criminal prosecution for his activities
30:34
in trying to subvert the 2020 election and it would not surprise me at
30:41
all Michael if these cases would be decided in
30:47
Tandem and in different ways with a ruling that Trump is eligible to run but
30:55
a ruling that he is not immune from Pro prosecution and sending the case back down for trial even as the election
31:02
season heats up and that would give the court the opportunity to look
31:09
even-handed to give Trump a significant Victory and a significant loss and leave
31:15
it not only to the political process but
31:20
the ordinary criminal judicial process to decide whether Donald Trump can be
31:27
held accountable for his January 6 related
31:37
activities well Adam thank you very much we appreciate it thank you
31:47
Michael we'll be right
31:53
back here's what else you need to another day the special councel
31:58
investigating President Biden's handling of classified materials will not seek to
32:03
prosecute him but said there was evidence that Biden willfully retained
32:08
and disclosed some sensitive material in a report released on Thursday the
32:15
special councel said that when Biden left the White House after his vice presidency in 2017 he took classified
32:22
documents about Afghanistan and notebooks with handwritten entries that referred to sensitive
32:29
