The Staggering Success of Trumpâ€™s Trial Delay Tactics


0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael babbaro
0:03
this is the
0:05
[Music]
0:09
daily today for Donald Trump 2024 was
0:14
supposed to be dominated by criminal
0:17
trials instead he's found ways to delay
0:21
almost all of them my colleag Alan foyer
0:25
on how Trump did
0:28
it
0:30
[Music]
0:36
it's Thursday April
0:38
[Music]
0:42
11th so Alan we are on the cusp of the
The hush money case
0:46
very first criminal trial of former
0:49
president Donald Trump which begins next
0:52
week so all eyes are going to be on
0:54
Lower Manhattan yeah and you'll
0:57
definitely remember this case Michael
0:59
it's often short short-handed as the
1:00
hush money case it involves allegations
1:03
that Trump used illegal accounting
1:06
techniques to hide the fact that he had
1:08
paid off a porn star prosecutors say he
1:11
wanted to cover up a sexual Affair that
1:14
they had had so that the Scandal didn't
1:17
blow up Trump's
1:19
2016 presidential campaign right you
1:22
know that case which has always been a
1:25
weird mix of like tabloid and election
1:28
interference stuff it's sometimes
1:30
written off as the run of the various
1:34
cases Trump is facing even though that's
1:36
not quite true nonetheless it is the
1:39
exception in one important way it is
1:42
actually going to go in front of a jury
1:46
before the election takes place before
1:48
voters go to the polls let's not forget
1:50
Trump is facing
1:52
four criminal cases in four separate
1:56
cities and in three of them he legal
2:00
team have managed in various ways to
2:02
throw sand into the gears of these
2:05
proceedings to essentially grind them
2:07
down to all but a halt right it appears
The classified documents case
2:11
that Trump has found a way to push back
2:14
basically 75% of the criminal cases
2:18
brought against him until it looks like
2:20
for now after voters are going to decide
2:23
whether or not to reelect him which if
2:25
it stays that way would be a pretty
2:28
astonishing accomplishment of a kind in
2:31
I'd argue both a legal and a political
2:33
sense yeah it would be a remarkable
2:36
subversion of the normal course of
2:38
justice and look for that reason alone
2:42
it makes sense that like studying some
2:44
of the tactics that Trump's lawyers have
2:47
used in each of these cases right filing
2:51
motion after motion after motion after
2:53
motion many of which are filled with
2:55
far-fetched or even frivolous claims and
2:58
one of the places where we we've seen
3:00
this in like the starkest terms is in
3:04
Trump's classified documents case in
3:07
Florida this is the case in which Trump
3:11
has been charged with taking home from
3:15
the White House a trove of extremely
3:20
classified documents containing all
3:22
kinds of National Defense secrets about
3:25
military capabilities nuclear programs
3:28
right and ing them in Crazy places in
3:32
his home at maral Lago down in West Palm
3:35
Beach Florida right I'm remembering the
3:37
photos I mean stages bathrooms closets
3:41
yes and on top of that the government
3:43
has accused him of obstructing this long
3:46
attempt this repeated attempts by the
3:48
authorities to get that stuff back in
3:51
some sense this case is the strongest
3:54
criminal case that has been brought
3:55
against Trump the facts are at least
3:58
alleged by the government are pretty
4:00
damning not to mention he's caught on a
4:02
recording at one point showing some of
4:05
this material to other people at Mara
4:07
Lago and saying to them hey I shouldn't
4:10
be showing you this stuff because it's
4:11
classified right a prosecutor's dream
A prosecutors dream
4:15
yeah yeah in many ways so and if this
4:17
seemed like perhaps the strongest of the
4:19
four criminal cases against Trump what
4:23
exactly is the story of how he and his
4:26
lawyers have delayed it to the point
4:29
where it does not appear that there will
4:31
be a trial before November before the
4:34
election well look in short Trump's
4:37
lawyers have raised a series of
4:39
far-fetched defenses and the judge in
4:42
this case has really engaged with these
4:46
defenses and
4:48
entertained these arguments in a way
4:51
that frankly I don't think most federal
4:54
judges would have so tell us about both
4:57
Trump's tactics and about this judge we
5:01
can do both at the same time Michael so
5:03
let's not forget that the first big
5:05
public event of this case was a search
5:09
of maral Lago Trump's private club and
5:12
residence in West Palm Beach in Florida
5:15
and the consequences of that search fall
5:18
into the hands of a very unusual judge
5:23
who catches this case her name is Aileen
5:25
Cannon she was appointed by Trump
5:28
himself in Trump's waning days in office
5:32
and she is a young judge and checks all
5:35
the boxes Federalist society and clerked
5:39
for a conservative judge herself but
5:42
while she may have had all the right
5:45
kinds of experience she just didn't have
5:48
a lot of experience so at the moment
5:51
that she inherits this case in August of
5:55
2022 she's only been on the bench two
5:57
years she's had a some total of 14 Trial
6:02
days over the course of four trials
6:04
she's only had four trials wow and so
6:06
she is the person who kind of inherits
6:10
this
6:11
enormous case involving at that point an
6:14
FBI search of a former president's
6:17
residence and really right from the
6:19
beginning Trump's lawyers just throw
6:21
everything they can at this search
6:25
warrant issue trying to bog the entire
6:28
investigation down you know and they end
6:31
up challenging the search in a really
6:34
weird way they say because Trump is a
6:37
former president he has executive
6:39
privilege over all the material that the
6:42
FBI took out of Mara Lago and so the
6:46
lawyers want judge Canon not only to
6:49
appoint an independent Arbiter to sort
6:52
through all that material and sort of
6:55
take out the innocuous stuff from the
6:57
stuff that's highly privileged they want
7:00
the judge to essentially interfere in
7:04
this case to the point of freezing the
7:06
FBI's
7:07
investigation entirely wow until this
7:11
independent arbiter's work is done so
The freeze request
7:14
that's a very ambitious request Trump's
7:16
lawyers want a major FBI investigation
7:19
into a former president very
7:21
high-profile to just go on Ice while
7:25
some legal figure sorts through paper to
7:29
see if something's in there that
7:31
shouldn't be yes exactly and lo and
7:34
behold judge Cannon grants this request
7:37
she freezes the case but the appellant
7:41
court that sits over judge Canon the
7:43
11th circuit very quickly and very
7:46
forcefully smacks her down and reverses
7:49
her and essentially says look you have
7:52
violated the principle of the rule of
7:54
law you can't just make an exception in
7:56
this case because the guy happens to be
7:59
a former president that's not how usw
8:03
works but in the metime there has been a
8:06
delay a delay of several weeks in a case
8:10
where every day every week counts yes
8:14
that's exactly right so this was like
8:16
the Prelude to the main event so to
8:19
speak this is before the indictment
8:22
against Trump was filed but we've seen
8:25
very much the same Dynamic play out
8:30
through the totality of the case once
8:34
the indictment was formally brought
8:38
we'll describe how these tactics play
8:39
out once there is an actual indictment
8:42
against Trump for taking these documents
8:44
sure so you know within months of the
8:46
indictment being filed Trump's lawyers
8:48
start submitting just a barrage of
8:52
motions to judge Candon in this case
8:54
they make a really out there motion to
8:56
kind of rumage through the communic
9:00
of all these various National Security
9:02
officials because they want to prove
9:04
that the Deep state collaborated in
9:07
order to bring this case against
9:09
trumping they're filing motions saying
9:12
like oh other politicians and public
9:15
figures have found classified documents
9:18
you know in their possession but they
9:19
were never charged and Trump is being
9:21
singled out unfairly as the only guy
9:23
who's been charged in this case so
9:25
they're they're burying judge canon in
9:27
paper they are burying her in paper
9:29
and things are really just sort of
9:31
piling up on her desk in a way that at
9:34
least from the outside looks like she's
9:35
really struggling to prioritize
9:38
decisions and she's leaving this Log Jam
9:41
of unresolved issues that just keeps
9:44
growing and growing and one of the
9:46
ultimate consequences of all of this is
9:49
that she can't set a trial date yet
9:53
because she hasn't made all of these
9:55
subsidiary decisions so the Log Jam
9:58
itself
9:59
makes the delay problem even worse and
The Presidential Records Act
10:02
of course none of this seems all that
10:04
surprising because as you have said she
10:05
is a brand new judge she's never before
10:08
handled a case on this scale sure and
10:12
it's very clear that Trump's lawyers are
10:15
leveraging both her inexperience and
10:18
some sort of Prior indication by her
10:22
that she is willing to entertain
10:25
unorthodox arguments and so one of the
10:27
most unorthodox arguments that they make
10:30
in a motion to judge Canon is one to
10:33
dismiss the case
10:35
altogether because of a law known as the
10:39
presidential records act okay and here
10:42
you're going to have to educate us yeah
10:44
so the quick gloss on the presidential
10:46
records Act is that it was passed after
10:48
Watergate to essentially ensure that
10:50
most records created during a
10:52
president's time in office remain in the
10:55
possession of the government they go to
10:57
the National Archives and while the law
11:00
does sort of permit presidents to lay
11:03
personal claim to things like Diaries
11:05
they kept while in office or notes or
11:07
stuff of an obvious personal nature the
11:09
point is that the people through the
11:11
government and the archives own the
11:14
official records of a presidency that
11:17
seems like it would be a law that would
11:18
be very bad for Trump in this case right
11:20
except he has flipped this law entirely
11:22
on its head in his defense he argued in
11:26
a motion that was filed at the end of
11:28
febru AR that under the small section of
11:32
the law that allows presidents to
11:34
designate records as personal he has
11:37
designated all of this super secret
11:40
highly classified military and defense
11:45
records as personal and his own property
11:49
huh and to make matters even a little
11:51
stranger he's not saying that he issued
11:53
a proclamation or wrote a formal uh
11:57
notification that he did this he's
11:58
saying the fact that he took these
12:01
records out of the White House to his
12:04
home in Florida de facto shows you that
12:08
they are his because if they weren't his
12:12
he would have given them back he's
Trumps Private Records
12:14
basically saying these classified
12:17
government records including nuclear
12:20
plans and War plans they're my private
12:23
records because I took them which sounds
12:26
a little bit like they're my private
12:28
personal records because I say they are
12:31
right exactly and so how does Judge
12:33
Canon respond to this Innovative
12:36
unexpected unorthodox motion well look
12:39
the fact is that most federal judges
12:42
when presented with this claim would
12:44
have dismissed it out of hand would not
12:47
have held a hearing would not have
12:49
entertained it would have said Thank you
12:51
Mr Trump for your argument motion denied
12:57
but judge Canon decides to take it quite
13:01
seriously and that has the effect not
13:05
just of further delaying the process as
13:08
she decides how to Grapple with this
13:12
argument but also it sets up the
13:16
possibility that she could kill this
13:18
case altogether without it ever going in
13:21
front of a
13:22
[Music]
13:28
jury
13:32
we'll be right
13:40
back Al at this point in our story this
Special Counsel Jack Smith
13:44
case of trump and the missing classified
13:46
documents is delayed and delayed and now
13:50
judge Cannon is engaging with this very
13:52
unusual argument that Trump can almost
13:55
wordlessly authorize himself to take
13:57
classified materials home from the white
13:59
house I have to imagine that Federal
14:02
prosecutors are trying to fight this in
14:05
every way imaginable yes they hate this
14:07
claim and they are absolutely fighting
14:09
it every which way they can let's not
14:12
forget the person in charge of the
14:13
prosecution at this point is the special
14:16
counsel Jack Smith who was brought into
14:18
the case really when Trump announced he
14:20
was running for president so there was
14:22
sort of you know some independence from
14:24
the justice department right and so what
14:26
Smith does when confronted with this
14:29
argument Advanced by Trump is of course
14:31
you know he files a motion trying to
14:33
oppose Trump's motion to dismiss and
14:35
then there's a hearing and at the
14:37
hearing you know his prosecutors are
14:40
telling judge Canon this is not what the
14:42
presidential records act says Trump has
14:45
this wrong the idea that he could sort
14:48
of like wordlessly transform this
14:51
material into his own personal property
14:53
is absurd and you should just get rid of
14:55
this argument altogether and what's
14:58
interesting thing is that for a moment
15:01
there it really looked like Canon was
15:03
going to rule against Trump's
15:06
presidential records act defense but
15:09
then a few days after the hearing she
15:12
made an extremely unusual move and what
15:16
she did was she asked both sides the
15:19
defense and prosecution to write jury
15:22
instructions that sort of
15:25
adopted Trump's presidential records act
15:28
defense
Judge Canons Unusual Decision
15:29
and why would she want this in jury
15:31
instructions especially if she has cast
15:34
doubt on it yes well you've hit on
15:36
exactly what made this whole thing so
15:38
weird and curious just as a basic matter
15:40
jury instructions are generally decided
15:43
on the eve of a trial so it's weird to
15:47
be thinking about how to instruct a jury
15:51
when the jury hasn't even been selected
15:54
yet there isn't even a solid trial date
15:57
for this case at this point
15:59
right but the idea that we're working
16:02
with here is simply that jury
16:04
instructions are the way that a judge
16:06
explains the case to jurors sort of
16:09
what's the law here how should it be
16:11
interpreted you know I think a familiar
16:13
example might be in a murder trial for
16:15
instance a judge will explain to the
16:17
jury the legal difference between say
16:20
manslaughter and homicide sort of
16:23
guiding them in how to interpret the law
16:25
so that they can decide whether or not a
16:27
person has actually broken it mhm the
16:29
unusual part in this case is that judge
16:33
Canon has seemed to adopt Trump's own
16:38
interpretation of the presidential
16:41
records act wow and if she was using
16:44
that concept to help you know guide the
16:48
jury towards making a decision on guilt
16:51
or innocence it was almost like she was
16:53
nudging them towards an aquid because if
16:57
the stuff is indeed his own personal
16:59
property then the jury only has one way
17:01
to decide right right if it really is
17:04
his personal property they have to
17:06
acquit and so nobody was quite sure
17:09
including mind you Jack Smith about what
17:11
she was doing because it was so unusual
17:15
and unorthodox right and if you're the
Double Jeopardy
17:17
prosecutor you might be confused about
17:19
what the judge is doing here but you're
17:21
definitely not confused about how
17:24
dangerous it is to your case and to add
17:27
something even more damaging to the case
17:30
once a jury is seated the concept of
17:33
Double Jeopardy comes into play right
17:35
that's that you can't be tried twice for
17:38
the same crime so if the jury acquits
17:42
Trump using these jury instructions
17:45
based on his own defense it's over
17:48
there's no appeal there's nothing Jack
17:51
Smith can do about it Case Closed move
17:54
on got it so we're kind of back where we
The Barnstormer
17:56
were a few minutes ago which is to say
17:58
fed Federal prosecutors really do not
18:00
want judge Canon to in any way endorse
18:03
this correct and so what ends up
18:05
happening is they file a
18:09
Barnstormer of a response to judge
18:13
Canon's request for jury instructions
18:16
it's the kind of stuff that you never
18:18
hear prosecutors say to a federal judge
18:22
like what well for example one you've
18:25
got this whole thing wrong your idea
18:29
that the presidential records act has
18:31
anything to do with this case is totally
18:34
legally flawed it's a fiction that Trump
18:37
made up out of whole cloth and it
18:40
belongs nowhere in this case at all and
18:44
so they ask judge Canon to do two things
18:46
they say look the normal way to proceed
18:50
here is just go back to the motion to
18:54
dismiss this case based on the
18:56
presidential records act and reject it
18:58
out of hand
18:59
just tell Trump you can't have this case
19:01
thrown out before it goes to a jury
19:04
making this argument and don't put this
19:08
stuff into the jury instructions and he
19:12
gave her jury instructions that in his
19:14
mind would follow the law and had
19:16
nothing to do with the presidential
19:18
records act so it sounds like this
Judge Canons Response
19:20
motion from the federal prosecutors from
19:21
Jack Smith has the quality of almost
19:24
tutoring judge canon in the ways of the
19:26
law in the order in which she should be
19:28
doing things basically it's Jack Smith
19:31
saying to judge Kenan you really don't
19:34
get this correct but in a not so gentle
19:37
way okay so what does Judge Canon do
19:40
with this perhaps not so diplomatic
19:43
response from the federal prosecutors
19:45
she kind of splits the baby on the one
19:48
hand she gives Jack Smith a little bit
19:50
of what he wants she rejects altogether
19:53
Trump's motion to dismiss the case based
19:55
on the presidential records act and she
19:57
agrees with Jack Smith that like this
19:59
notion that Trump declared this stuff
20:01
his own personal property it's not
20:03
enough just to kill the case before it
20:05
even goes to trial at all got it and yet
20:09
and yet in a very prickly way in her
20:12
order she tells Jack Smith that she's
20:15
going to keep this idea of using the
20:17
presidential records act in the jury
20:20
instructions open and so she's
20:23
essentially allowing the possibility
20:25
that there's still this sort of
20:27
existential threat hanging over the case
20:31
when it eventually goes into jury
20:34
deliberations got it so this particular
A Giant Threat
20:38
delay tactic from Trump and his lawyers
20:42
this effort to kind of invert the
20:45
meaning of the presidential records act
20:47
it's not just a very successful delay
20:50
tactic which as we've established it
20:52
very much seems it is it now has become
20:59
a giant threat to the federal
21:01
government's case and potentially a
21:05
strong basis for Trump to Prevail in
21:07
this case that seemed very strong and a
21:13
case that Trump would have a hard time
21:14
willing out of yeah Trump's lawyers
21:16
raised this wacky argument in the kind
21:21
of normal way you do it in the context
21:24
of a motion to dismiss so what's most
21:27
unusual setting aside the unusual nature
21:30
of the defense itself is the way judge
21:33
Canon said no to the motion to dismiss
21:38
and yet allowed this wacky defense
21:41
argument to linger in the context of
21:43
jury instructions and that was not
21:46
something Trump's lawyers asked for that
21:49
was wholly of Judge Cannon's devising
21:52
she came up with that idea herself
21:54
that's what makes this all so strange so
The Lucky Draw
21:57
now I'm curious Alan if this classified
22:00
documents prosecution had proceeded down
22:03
a traditional normal path without this
22:08
very unique interplay of Trump's delay
22:10
tactics and what seems like for him the
22:14
Lucky Draw of a pretty inexperienced
22:16
slow-moving judge willing to entertain a
22:18
lot of his unusual arguments when do we
22:21
think this trial would have probably
22:23
started well judge Canon had initially
22:26
said it was going to start at the end of
22:27
May but then she very quickly kind of
22:29
said that was not going to happen I mean
22:32
she's got like 15 to 20 motions sitting
22:35
on her desk that she hasn't decided yet
22:38
and you know some of them could wind up
22:40
being appealed she could set hearings
22:43
right two or three days to argue about
22:46
this stuff and so it's just she has let
22:49
a mountain of Unfinished Business
22:51
complicate the trial schedule so that is
Trumps Other Cases
22:54
how we arrive at this reality that
22:56
Trump's strategy has already basically
22:59
succeeded in keeping this case from
23:02
unfolding before election day yeah and
23:05
don't forget it's not just in that case
23:07
you know two of Trump's other criminal
23:09
cases also don't have trial dates yet I
23:12
mean you know his case in Washington
23:14
involving January 6 and the runup to it
23:17
he used a kind of similar wacky motion
23:20
to dismiss that he managed to get all
23:22
the way up to the Supreme Court and you
23:24
know we're waiting for the Supreme Court
23:26
to render a decision to see whether or
23:29
not that case sneaks in before the
23:31
election or not and then in Georgia
23:34
where Trump has been charged also with
23:36
election interference he kind of
23:38
capitalized on this romantic
23:41
relationship that the prosecutor Fanny
23:43
Willis had with one of her deputies and
23:45
bury the judge with a bunch of motions
23:47
claiming that there was a conflict of
23:49
interest due to that relationship and
23:51
that ate up you know a period of almost
23:53
two months so I want to know how you're
The Criminal Justice System
23:56
thinking about this as someone who has
23:57
covered courts and criminal justice for
24:00
so long Trump didn't invent the idea of
24:04
seeking to delay the wheels of our
24:06
Criminal Justice System corporations
24:08
have been doing it for a long time rich
24:10
people with fancy lawyers they do this
24:13
kind of thing but it does seem that he
24:16
has been stunningly successful at it and
24:19
I wonder how you think about it well
24:22
look one way to think about it is that
24:25
the criminal justice system itself just
24:28
really isn't set up to handle a
24:31
situation when you have a sophisticated
24:34
group of lawyers who really just wake up
24:37
and just figure out ways in which to
24:41
delay and hinder each of the four cases
24:44
that Trump is in that's all they're
24:46
doing the entirety of the strategy here
24:49
is to file motions of often times you
24:53
know limited legal value just to kind of
24:56
gum things up and if these lawyers are
24:58
able to kind of present a unified
25:00
strategy in each of the cases there's
25:03
very little that the prosecution can do
25:05
about it except respond in a really
25:09
reactive way because they are
25:12
essentially having to play Trump's game
25:14
at this
25:16
point and the way the system is set up
25:20
you know our presumption of innocence
25:22
sort of permits this kind of gaming of
25:26
the system cuz we want crimin defendants
25:29
obviously to try everything they can to
25:31
sort of defend themselves but if that
25:35
fundamental part of our criminal justice
25:37
system is being leveraged perhaps in bad
25:40
faith there's really nothing that the
25:42
government can do about it except go
25:45
through it that's our only choice in all
25:48
of
25:49

Michael this week Trump undertook
26:09
multiple efforts to delay the one
26:12
criminal trial scheduled to begin before
26:14
the election the hush money case one of
26:18
those efforts filed on Wednesday
26:20
involved Trump directly suing the judge
26:23
overseeing the
26:25
trial so far none of the delay tax I
26:28
have succeeded and the trial is
26:31
scheduled to begin on
26:33

26:42
Monday we'll be right
26:50
back here's what else you need to know
Outro
26:53
day on Wednesday the government said
26:56
that inflation Rose in March potentially
26:59
undermining the case for reducing the
27:02
country's High interest rate as many
27:05
including President Biden have pushed
27:08
for the Consumer Price Index a measure
27:11
of prices across the economy Rose
27:14
3.5% in March compared with a year ago a
27:18
higher number than economists had
27:20
forecast so how concerned are you about
27:23
the fight against inflation stalling and
27:26
do you stand by your prediction for a
27:27
rate cut
27:28
well I do stand by my prediction that
27:30
before the year is out to be a rate cut
27:32
this may during a news conference at the
27:34
White House Biden said he remained
27:36
confident that the Federal Reserve would
27:38
soon reduce interest rates and he
27:41
defended his administration's overall
27:43
record on inflation we have dramatically
27:47
reduced inflation from 9% down to close
27:50
to 3% we're in a situation where we're
27:53
better situated than we were when we
27:55
took office where we inflation
