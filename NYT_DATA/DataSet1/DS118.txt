Is the Future of Medicine Hidden in Ancient DNA?



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:04
tavernes and this is the
0:07
[Music]
0:10
daily in a major new advance in science
0:14
DNA from Bronze Age skeletons is
0:17
providing new Clues to modern-day
0:19
medical
0:21
Mysteries today my colleague Carl Zimmer
0:25
explains how a new field of science is
0:27
changing the way we think about treat
0:30
ments for devastating
0:35
diseases it's Wednesday January
0:38
[Music]
0:44
31st so Carl you are a science reporter
The Two Big Questions
0:47
as our listeners will know and you write
0:48
about Evolution and the origins of life
0:51
and you've recently written a story that
0:53
really piqu my interest it was about a
0:56
major new discovery in our understanding
0:58
of ancient people and it's leading to
1:01
some big advances as I understand it in
1:03
modern medicine so tell me about it well
1:06
scientists have been wondering about two
1:09
big questions for a long time one of
1:12
them is why do we get sick the other
1:14
question is where do we come from and
1:18
they seem like they should have two very
1:21
different answers but now scientists are
1:23
starting to realize maybe the two
1:25
questions actually have the same
1:28
answer the me answer how Carl well it's
The Me Answer
1:32
possible that in order to treat the
1:36
diseases we have to deal with today
1:38
diseases often that have no treatment
1:40
yet it may be necessary to go back
1:43
thousands of years and look at how our
1:46
ancestors lived then what were the
1:48
challenges they faced what was their
1:51
health like what kind of genes did they
1:53
carry and maybe we can then come back to
1:57
the present and start to be able to make
1:59
make our own health better and now
2:02
researchers have just made some really
2:04
big discoveries both about human history
2:07
and about our diseases at the same time
2:10
and this history actually lives inside
2:13
of us right now in our own genes and has
2:16
big implications for our health okay so
2:19
two branches of science coming together
2:22
as you say making some major new
2:24
discovery so tell me about this first
2:26
field of science Carl what's happening
2:28
there well you know once upon a time if
2:31
you wanted to study ancient life you
2:34
were pretty much limited to
Ancient Life
2:37
fossils you know after an animal or
2:40
person died their body is decomposed and
2:43
if you're lucky their bones managed to
2:45
survive in
2:47
rock and then thousands or millions of
2:50
years later a paleontologist would come
2:52
along and dig those fossils out but
2:56
now it is actually possible to to dig up
3:01
those bones and to drill a little sample
3:04
out of them and find some DNA still
3:07
surviving in
3:10
it so this actually gives you a glimpse
3:14
into you know the
3:16
molecular life of these ancient people
3:20
or ancient animals and it's amazing
3:23
enough when scientists can get just a
3:27
single Gene out of a fossil that's
3:30
thousands and thousands of years old but
3:33
actually the science has come so far in
3:35
recent years that it's pretty common for
3:39
scientists to get a whole genome of an
3:43
extinct species that is like every
3:45
single Gene every stretch of DNA uh
3:49
reconstructed pretty
3:51
[Music]
3:55
accurately once you can look at the
Ancient Ancestors
3:57
whole genome of some ancient organism
4:02
you are really starting to get the big
4:04
picture of how that thing lived and
4:07
looking back at our own past we can
4:10
actually use this ancient DNA from
4:12
fossils to figure out some clues about
4:17
our ancient relatives going back a
4:19
couple hundred thousand years actually
4:21
and this includes ancient relatives like
4:24
neander tals for example so now we can
4:26
actually see an entire Genome of neander
4:29
but more recently what's been really
4:32
spectacular is actually how scientists
4:34
have been able to focus on the past
4:36
10,000 years and what we're talking
4:39
about there is that time in history
4:42
where hunter gatherers started to
4:45
domesticate animals and plants and start
4:48
to farm when you started to have the
4:50
first towns when you started to have
4:53
first large scale societies and we can
4:56
actually go now and see what the DNA of
4:59
these people look like actually we can
5:01
see thousands of people from this time
5:04
period okay so we're really getting a
5:06
clearer picture of how groups of ancient
5:10
peoples came to be and live their lives
5:13
many many years ago but how specific is
5:16
that picture like what does it look like
5:17
what are some of the things we're
5:18
learning
5:19
Carl we're learning about all sorts of
What Are We Learning
5:22
things about these people's lives by
5:24
looking at their DNA I mean some people
5:27
today you know they can drink milk and
5:30
be fine with that and some people are
5:31
lactose intolerant well we can actually
5:33
look back at the DNA and say who was
5:36
lactose intolerant uh among ancient
5:39
Farmers 8,000 years ago we can say that
5:42
we can start to actually get clues about
5:44
the color of the skin of people who
5:46
lived 10,000 years ago we can figure out
5:50
how societies were organized when you
5:52
come across a burial with several
5:54
skeletons in it when they all have
5:56
jewelry on it you can actually show
5:58
genetically if if they're related or not
6:00
and that might tell you you're looking
6:01
at say a royal family and on top of that
6:05
look at how these different groups of
6:07
people with certain genetic markers
6:10
moved around how they expanded from one
6:13
place to another how two populations
6:15
might interbreed so there's an
6:17
astonishing amount that you can learn
6:18
now from ancient DNA so we're basically
The Yamnaya
6:21
seeing the stories of different groups
6:24
of people over time yeah that's right
6:27
and there are group groups of people
6:31
that we didn't really know much about
6:33
before people who existed thousands of
6:36
years ago who now were realizing were
6:38
actually really important to the course
6:40
of history and one of those was actually
6:44
a group called The yamnaya okay yamnaya
6:48
that is not a group I am familiar with
6:50
not a household name well archaeologists
6:52
have known about the
6:54
Yuma to some extent for for decades but
6:57
they couldn't really say that much about
6:59
them what has become clear now is that
7:02
the Yuma were living you know maybe
7:05
6,000 5,000 years
The Yamnaya as Farmers
7:09
ago they started out as Farmers but they
7:12
actually gave up farming because they
7:15
developed this practice of hurting
7:17
cattle and sheep and goats and they were
7:19
incredibly successful at this and they
7:22
were among the first horse
7:25
riders they would use the horses and
7:28
other livestock to call wagons and they
7:30
would just go across hundreds of
7:32
thousands of miles of the step from the
7:35
Ukraine all the way over to Central Asia
7:38
to places like
7:39
Kazakhstan they went from roaming around
7:43
to exploding across Europe and
7:48
Asia and when they showed up they took
7:53
over and you can see this actually when
7:57
they arrive in Denmark for example
7:59
scientists have looked very closely at
8:01
the DNA in Denmark from skeletons over
8:04
the past 10,000 years and you can see
8:07
that there's a group of farmers there
8:10
with a certain kind of ancestry and then
8:12
boom the yamnaya show up about 5,000
8:14
years ago that's it it's all Yuma so
The Yamnaya in Northern Europe
8:18
they showed up in northern Europe from
8:20
Central Asia and at some point became
8:22
the dominant population that's right we
8:25
don't know exactly how that happened
8:27
there are some very dark possibil ities
8:30
this could have been some kind of
8:32
genocide or maybe it wasn't such a
8:34
violent transition maybe it was a
8:36
competition for land that took decades
8:38
to play out but in any case we know that
8:42
the
8:43
yumnah became the people of the region
8:46
and then they became the ancestors of
8:50
people in northern Europe today people
8:53
today with northern European
8:55
ancestry they come from the ynah and
Why are these people important
8:58
Carl why are these people important I
9:00
mean why are we talking about yamnah in
9:03
the context of this genetic stuff well
9:05
in addition to being really important to
9:07
the course of history um they actually
9:09
matter to us
9:13
today because locked inside of their DNA
9:17
5,000 years ago are some really crucial
9:21
secrets about some of the most
9:23
devastating diseases we suffer from
9:25
[Music]
9:28
today
9:34
we'll be right
9:36
[Music]
Disease
9:48
back so Carl you said that this new
9:51
science was showing us something
9:52
important about these yamnah people and
9:55
it had to do with disease this little
9:57
code locked inside their DNA tell me
10:00
about that so this brings us to the
10:03
second field of science I was talking
10:05
about which is the basic question of why
10:08
we get sick we get these diseases and
10:12
they seem to have all sorts of just
10:14
random
10:15
symptoms but if you can understand their
10:19
history if you can understand their
10:20
evolution maybe they're not as random as
10:23
they seem Maybe by understanding their
10:26
history we're going to be able to treat
10:28
them
10:29
okay so this is these two fields of
10:31
science coming together like a kind of
10:34
you know scientific chocolate peanut
10:37
butter Reese's Peanut Butter Cup but
10:39
what's the process once they come
10:41
together like how do you study disease
10:42
in ancient people so on the one hand you
Disease in Ancient People
10:46
have some scientists who are looking at
10:49
the DNA of living
10:51
people and
10:53
finding different variations in their
10:55
genes that put them at risk for certain
10:58
diseases
11:00
there are genes that can raise your risk
11:03
for heart disease for cancer for
11:05
schizophrenia for all sorts of
11:07
conditions and scientists have actually
11:10
been able to create pretty long lists of
11:13
these genes where there's strong
11:14
evidence that if you have a certain
11:16
version of a gene you are at a greater
11:18
risk of getting these
11:21
diseases and so these scientists who are
11:24
pulling ancient DNA out of bones that
11:26
are 5,000 10,000 years old are saying
11:29
well let's see if these people who lived
11:32
thousands of years ago had those genes
11:35
too when did these mutations arise and
11:39
how did they spread let's trace the
11:42
whole history of these mutations that
11:45
today put us at risk of different
11:47
diseases so how exactly do they do that
11:50
well one of these projects is based on a
11:54
British database called the UK
UK Biobank
11:57
biobank
12:00
what happens there is that half a
12:02
million volunteers have submitted their
12:05
DNA and allowed scientists to compare
12:08
their DNA to their own medical records
12:11
and so that they can see links between
12:15
their genetic variations and the kinds
12:18
of diseases they're suffering from so
12:20
basically these scientists are tracing
12:22
the diseases people have to mutations in
12:26
their genes and looking for patterns of
12:29
cross populations that's right and so
12:32
then what you can do is you can compare
12:35
their DNA of these living people in
12:37
Britain to all of this ancient DNA from
12:41
across Europe and Asia and you can try
12:43
to figure out well where is their DNA
12:47
coming from who did they inherit their
12:48
DNA from and did they actually inherit
12:51
some of these disease genes from those
12:54
ancient
12:57
people
Bronze Age Mutations
12:59
so it's kind of like a 23 and me to
13:01
figure out who you were related to in
13:03
the Bronze Age right and whether they
13:05
passed down anything to you that might
13:07
make you sick now that's right and what
13:11
they found were mutations that today we
13:16
know increase people's risks for a whole
13:20
bunch of different diseases but with a
13:23
Twist some of these mutations were
13:26
beneficial to those people thousands of
13:28
years
13:29
ago okay that is kind of mind-blowing
13:32
okay so explain that to me Carl what's
13:34
an example so we can go back to the Yuma
13:38
for a really powerful example of this so
13:41
the Yuma were hurting
Animals
13:44
animals they were with their animals all
13:47
the time they were just going back and
13:48
forth along the step always with the
13:52
animals and that was great because that
13:54
gave them a source of meat it gave them
13:57
a source of milk of leather wool like
14:00
this incredible resource that you have
14:01
right on hand but animals have something
14:04
else they have
14:07
diseases and so if you're going to be
14:10
living with animals you are actually at
14:12
risk of picking up some of the diseases
14:15
that they're carrying so Carl were the
14:18
yumnaa the first people to actually live
14:21
with animals and then therefore get sick
14:23
from them well the Amah were getting
14:28
diseases from animals at a rate that was
14:30
really different than people had before
14:33
because they were living with these
14:34
animals so much of the time and we
14:38
actually know that because we can see it
14:42
for ourselves in their bones when you
14:44
drill into the bones of the yamnah or
14:47
other ancient people you can get out the
14:49
DNA of the people themselves and
14:52
sometimes you can also get the DNA out
14:54
of the germs that killed them H amazing
14:58
it is amazing and we know for a fact
15:00
that they were dealing with a lot of
15:02
diseases and it turns out that they were
15:04
actually evolving a resistance to
15:09
them evolving resistance to them how
Evolution
15:12
exactly so if you had a mutation that
15:15
ramped up your immune system so that you
15:18
were better able to fight off these
15:20
germs that were spilling over from these
15:23
animals all around you that would mean
15:25
you're more likely to live long enough
15:28
to have kids and pass down that Gene to
15:30
them so if you look across the DNA of
15:35
Yuma they have a lot of
15:37
mutations for the first time that are
15:41
associated with a really strong immune
15:43
response but there's something else
15:46
that's really important about these
15:48
genes in the
15:50
Yuma these are some of the same genes
15:53
that
15:54
today can put people at risk for certain
15:57
diseases one of one of those diseases is
15:59
multiple
Multiple Sclerosis
16:01
sclerosis multiple sclerosis like very
16:04
debilitating disease that's right yes
16:07
when people develop multiple
16:09
sclerosis their immune cells look at
16:12
their own nerves as the enemy they
16:15
actually will attack the nerves in the
16:18
body and this is incredibly debilitating
16:21
um it can progress to the point where
16:22
people can't walk have trouble talking
16:25
you know it affects millions of people
16:26
today and yet we're seeing some of the
16:31
genes that put people at risk of Ms
16:34
today actually being
16:37
beneficial in the yumnaa okay so explain
How was it protective to the Yuma
16:40
that Carl like how was it protective to
16:43
the Yuma but obviously very debilitating
16:46
and problematic today like how did that
16:49
happen so if we go back to the yumnah
16:51
four or 5,000 years ago they are being
16:53
exposed to a lot of diseases a lot of
16:55
bacteria maybe a lot of viruses now
16:58
recently like in the past Century a lot
17:01
of those pathogens have gone away so you
17:06
have pasteurized milk you have clean
17:07
water you have all these innovations
17:10
that make these pathogens much less of a
17:13
threat to People's Health but they still
17:17
have this aggressive immune system they
17:21
still have an immune system that evolved
17:23
for this tug of war with the pathogens
17:25
and now if the immune system is not
17:29
being continually challenged by these
17:31
pathogens it looks like sometimes the
17:33
immune system makes mistakes in it's
17:36
aggressiveness it
17:38
misfires so that there are opportunities
17:41
to get confused and to start to look at
17:45
a person's own body as the enemy okay
Practical implications
17:48
that's pretty interesting that like
17:49
something that was so protective Through
17:52
the Ages suddenly becomes a real
17:56
hindrance because everything changed
17:58
really in the past 100 years or so but
18:02
how exactly does knowing this actually
18:04
help people who have MS today Carl what
18:07
are the practical implications here well
18:09
it helps us to understand why it is that
18:12
some people get Ms and other people
18:14
don't Recent research has pointed to a
18:18
virus called Epstein bar as the trigger
18:20
for Ms and other words you probably
18:23
don't get Ms unless you get infected
18:25
with Epstein bar MH but the fact is that
18:28
most people get infected with mcen
18:31
bar and maybe a couple million people
18:33
have MS so clearly there's something
18:36
special about these people and what's
18:40
special is that they have inherited
18:41
these genes and if you can
18:44
understand how those genes first evolved
18:48
what their functions were for 5,000
18:51
years ago that can actually help you to
18:53
understand how they're going wrong now
18:55
so you know right now there are some you
18:58
know fairly effective treatments for MS
19:00
they're okay for some people they're not
19:02
great for others but they're crude
19:04
they're kind of like a sledgehammer
19:06
basically they just sort of take the
19:07
immune system and just dial it all
19:10
down that's good in some ways because
19:13
then your immune system is not going to
19:15
be attacking yourself so readily but you
19:19
know like you do need your immune system
19:22
actually do need it to avoid getting
19:23
really sick from
19:25
infections so really what we need need
19:28
to do is find a better balance we need
19:31
to understand that what's happening is
19:34
that the immune system just has lost
19:36
this partner in this dance of survival
19:40
and so how can we mimic that are there
19:43
drugs that could actually like give the
19:46
immune system that balance again without
19:49
us having to get really sick and things
19:51
like that okay so understanding the
Understanding the origins
19:53
origins means we go from treating Ms
19:55
with this big Sledgehammer to a little
19:58
scalpel right we can really fine-tune
20:00
the treatment that's right and we start
20:03
to understand you know
20:06
why different people are at greater risk
20:10
of getting Ms you know why are the rates
20:14
highest in northern Europe you know
20:17
people came up with all sorts of stories
20:19
for a long time but we actually know why
20:22
we know because the Yuma showed up so it
20:25
takes some of the randomness out of it
20:27
right this research has helped us
20:29
understand something incredibly
20:30
important about this very debilitating
20:33
disease it has and this is really just a
20:36
trial run for this whole approach this
20:40
research was based just on the UK biopan
20:43
just on people in Britain but when we
20:45
look forward it's not just going to be
20:47
British people whose history scientists
20:50
are going to be unpacking it's going to
20:52
be people all over the
Future cures
20:54
[Music]
20:57
world we're going to be learning not
20:59
just about multiple sclerosis but we're
21:01
going to be learning about diseases like
21:04
heart disease diabetes uh conditions
21:07
like
21:08
schizophrenia and it may be possible to
21:10
understand how it is that actually maybe
21:13
the genes that put us at risk of these
21:15
diseases today or giving us other
21:17
benefits thousands of years
21:19
ago so in effect we could be sitting on
21:22
a whole new cache of future cures right
21:26
in all of our archaeological sites like
21:28
is the future of medical research
21:31
paleontology it could be it could be
21:33
this is what scientists sometimes call
21:35
evolutionary medicine but really up till
21:37
now it's been more of an idea than a
21:40
reality but the experts I talk to say
21:42
that with ancient DNA research like this
21:45
evolutionary medicine is now finally
21:47
coming of
21:52
age Carl thank you thanks so
21:57
much
