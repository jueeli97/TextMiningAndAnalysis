Are ‘Forever Chemicals’ a Forever Problem?




0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
Tavern and this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:10
daily this month for the first time the
0:13
Environmental Protection Agency began to
0:16
regulate a class of synthetic chemicals
0:19
known as forever chemicals in America's
0:22
drinking water but the chemicals which
0:25
have been linked to liver disease and
0:26
other serious health problems are in Far
0:29
More than just our water
0:31
supply today my colleague Kim Tingley
0:40
[Music]
0:45
explains it's Wednesday April
0:49
[Music]
0:54
17th so Kim anytime the EPA announces a
0:58
regulation I think we all sort of take
1:00
take notice because implicit in it is
1:02
this idea that we have been exposed to
1:03
something something bad potentially lead
1:07
or asbest you know and recently the EPA
1:11
is regulating a type of chemical known
1:13
as pasas so for those who don't know
1:17
what are pasas chemicals yeah so P
1:22
stands for per and poly floral alkal
1:26
substances they're often called Forever
1:29
chemical
1:30
just because they persist so long in the
1:33
environment and they don't easily break
1:36
down and for that reason we also use
1:38
them in a ton of consumer products
1:41
they're in makeup they're in carpet
1:44
they're in non-stick cookware they're in
1:46
food packaging all sorts of things yeah
1:49
I feel like I've been hearing about
1:50
these chemicals actually for a very long
1:52
time I mean non-stick pans Teflon right
1:54
that's the thing that's in my mind when
1:56
I think pasas absolutely yeah this class
1:59
of chemicals has been around for decades
2:03
and what's really important about this
2:05
is that the EPA has decided for the
2:07
first time to regulate them in drinking
2:10
water and that's a ruling that stands to
2:13
affect tens of millions of people so
2:15
help me understand where these things
2:17
came from and how it's taken so long to
2:20
get to the point where we're actually
2:21
regulating them so they really actually
2:24
came about a long time ago 1938 Dupont
2:28
the people who eventually got us to Eon
2:30
they were actually looking for a more
2:33
stable kind of refrigerant and they came
2:35
upon this kind of chemical pasas the
2:39
thing that all pasas chemicals have is a
2:42
really strong bond between carbon atoms
2:46
and Florine atoms this particular
2:49
pairing is super strong and super
2:51
durable they have water repellent
2:53
properties they're stain resistant
2:56
they're grease resistant and they found
2:59
a lot of uses for them initially um in
3:01
World War II they were using them you
3:03
know as part of their uranium enrichment
3:05
process to do all these kinds of things
3:08
and then well good thing it's Teflon you
3:12
know in the 1950s is when they really
3:14
started to come out as commercial
3:17
products even burned food won't stick to
3:20
Teflon so it's always easy to clean so
3:23
Dupont started using it in Teflon panss
3:27
cookware never needs scouring if it has
3:30
Dupont
3:33
Teflon and then another company 3M also
3:37
started using a kind of P we make Scotch
3:40
Guard fabric protector it keeps ordinary
3:42
skills from becoming extraordinary
3:44
stains in one of their big products
3:46
Scotch Guard so you probably remember
3:48
spraying that on your shoes if you want
3:50
to make your shoes waterproof you Scotch
3:53
Guard fabric protector and let your cup
3:55
run it
3:57
over right Miracle product scotchguard
4:00
Teflon but of course we're talking about
4:02
these chemicals because they've been
4:04
found to pose Health threats when does
4:07
that risk start to
4:09
surface yeah so it's pretty early on
4:12
that Dupont and 3M start finding effects
4:17
in animals and studies that they're
4:19
running in
4:23
house around the mid 60s they start
4:26
seeing that past has an effect on rats
4:31
it's increasing the liver and kidney
4:34
weights of the rats and so that seems
4:36
problematic and they keep running tests
4:38
you know over kind of the next decade
4:40
and a half and they try different things
4:43
with different animals in one study they
4:46
gave monkeys really really high levels
4:49
of pasas and those monkeys died and so
4:54
they have a pretty strong sense that
4:56
these chemicals could be dangerous
5:00
and then in
5:01
1979 they start to see that the workers
5:05
that are in the plants manufacturing you
5:07
know working with these chemicals that
5:10
they're starting to have higher rates of
5:12
abnormal liver
5:14
function and in a Teflon plant they had
5:18
some pregnant workers that were working
5:20
with these chemicals and one of those
5:22
workers in 1981 gave birth to a child
5:25
who had some pretty severe birth
5:28
defects and then by the mid 1980s Dupont
5:32
figures out that it's not just their
5:34
workers who are being exposed to these
5:36
chemicals but communities that are
5:39
living in areas surrounding their Teflon
5:42
plant particularly the one in parkerburg
5:45
West Virginia that those communities
5:48
have p in their tap
5:54
water wow so based on its own studies
5:58
Dupont knows its chemicals are making
6:00
animals sick they seem to be making
6:02
workers sick and now they found out that
6:04
the chemicals have made their way into
6:05
the water supply what did they do with
6:08
that information as far as we know they
6:10
didn't do much they certainly didn't
6:13
tell the residents of parkerburg who
6:16
were drinking that water that there was
6:18
anything that they needed to be worried
6:20
about how is that possible I mean
6:22
setting aside the fact that dupan is the
6:24
one actually studying the health effects
6:26
of its own chemicals presumably to make
6:28
sure they're safe we've seen these big
6:30
regulating agencies like the EPA and the
6:32
FDA that exist in order to watch out for
6:36
something exactly like this right a
6:38
company that is producing something that
6:40
may be harming Americans why weren't
6:43
they keeping a closer watch yeah so it
6:46
goes kind of back to the way that we
6:48
regulate chemicals in the US it goes
6:52
through an act called the toxic
6:54
substances Control Act that's
6:56
administered by the EPA and basically
7:00
it gives companies a lot of room
7:03
to regulate themselves in a sense under
7:07
this act they have a responsibility to
7:10
report to the EPA you know if they find
7:12
these kinds of potential issues with a
7:15
chemical they have a responsibility to
7:18
you know sort of do their due diligence
7:20
when they're putting a chemical out into
7:21
the environment but there's really not a
7:24
ton of oversight you know the
7:26
enforcement mechanism is that the EPA
7:29
can find them but this kind of thing can
7:32
happen pretty easily where Dupont keeps
7:35
going with something that they think
7:37
might really be a problem and then the
7:41
fine by the time it plays out is just a
7:44
tiny fraction of what Dupont has earned
7:48
from producing these chemicals and so
7:50
really the incentive is for them to take
7:54
the punishment at the end rather than
7:56
pull it out early so it seems like
7:59
it's kind of just self-reporting which
8:02
is basically self-regulation in a way
8:05
yeah I think that that is the way a lot
8:07
of advocacy groups and experts have
8:10
characterized it to me is that chemical
8:12
companies are essentially regulating
8:15
themselves so how did this danger
8:18
eventually come to light I mean if this
8:19
is in some kind of DuPont Vault what
8:22
happened well there's a couple different
8:24
things that started to happen in the
8:26
late 90s
8:29
the community around parkerburg West
8:31
Virginia people had reported seeing
8:34
really strange symptoms in their
8:38
animals cows were losing their hair they
8:41
had lesions wow they were behaving
8:45
strangely some of their calves were
8:47
dying and a lot of people in the
8:49
community felt like they were having
8:53
health problems that just didn't really
8:56
have a good answer mysterious sicknesses
8:59
and some cases of
9:03
cancers and so they initiate a class
9:06
action lawsuit against
9:08
Dupont as part of that class action
9:11
lawsuit Dupont at a certain point is
9:14
forced to turn over all of their
9:16
Internal
9:17
Documentation and so what was in the
9:20
files was all of that research that we
9:23
mentioned all of the studies about
9:26
animals workers the birth defect it was
9:30
really the first time that the public
9:32
saw what Dupont and 3M had already seen
9:36
which is the potential Health harms of
9:38
these
9:42
chemicals so that seems pretty damning I
9:45
mean what happened to the
9:48
company so Dupont and 3M are still able
9:52
to say you know these were just a few
9:55
workers and they were working with high
9:58
levels of the chemical
9:59
you know more than a person would get
10:02
drinking it in the water and so there's
10:04
still sort of an opportunity for this to
10:07
be kind of correlation but not causation
10:10
there's not really a way to use that
10:13
data to prove you know for sure that it
10:16
was P that caused these health problems
10:20
in other words the company is arguing
10:21
look yes these two things exist at the
10:24
same time but it doesn't mean that one
10:26
caused the other exactly and so one of
10:29
the things that this class action
10:32
lawsuit demands in the settlement that
10:34
they eventually reach with Dupont is
10:37
they want Dupont to fund a formal
10:40
Independent Health study of the
10:43
communities that are affected by this p
10:46
and they're drinking water and so they
10:48
want Dupont to pay to figure out for
10:51
sure using the best available science
10:55
how many of these health problems are
10:57
potentially related to their
11:00
chemicals and so they ask them to pay
11:02
for it and they get together an
11:04
independent group of researchers to
11:07
undertake this study and it ends up
11:10
being the first and it still might be
11:12
the biggest
11:13
epidemiological study of p in a
11:18
community they've got about
11:21
69,000 participants in this study wow
11:25
that's big it's big yeah and what they
11:28
ended up deciding was that they could
11:31
confidently say that there was what they
11:33
ended up calling a probable link and so
11:35
they were really confident that the
11:38
chemical exposure that the study
11:41
participants had experienced was linked
11:44
to high cholesterol ulcerative colitis
11:48
thyroid disease testicular cancer kidney
11:52
cancer and pregnancy induced
11:55
hypertension wow and so those were the
11:58
conditions that they were able to say
12:00
with a good degree of certainty were
12:04
related to their chemical exposure there
12:05
were others that you know they just
12:07
didn't have the evidence to reach a
12:10
strong conclusion so overall pretty
12:13
substantial health effects and and kind
12:15
of vindicates the communities in West
12:17
Virginia that were claiming that these
12:19
chemicals were really affecting their
12:21
health absolutely and as the years have
12:24
gone on that was sort of just the
12:26
beginning of researchers starting to
12:29
understand all the different kinds of
12:32
health problems that these chemicals
12:34
could potentially be causing and so
12:37
since the big Dupont class action study
12:41
there's really just been like this
12:43
building and building and building of
12:45
different researchers coming out with
12:47
these different pieces of evidence that
12:49
have accumulated to a pretty alarming
12:53
picture of what some of the potential
12:55
Health outcomes could be
13:02
okay so that really kind of brings us to
13:04
the present moment right when it last it
13:07
seems the EPA is saying enough is enough
13:10
we need to regulate these things yeah it
13:13
seems like the EPA has been watching
13:16
this preponderance of evidence
13:19
accumulate and they're sort of deciding
13:22
that it's a real health problem
13:25
potentially that they need to regulate
13:30
so the EPA has identified six of these
13:34
past chemicals that it's going to
13:37
regulate but the concern that I think a
13:41
lot of experts have is that this
13:44
particular regulation is not going to
13:46
keep P out of our bodies
13:52
[Music]
14:03
[Music]
14:05
we'll be right
14:11
back so Kim you just said that these
14:14
regulations probably won't keep past
14:17
chemicals out of our bodies what did you
14:19
mean well the EPA is talking about
14:23
regulating these six kinds of past but
14:26
there are actually more than 10,000
14:29
different kinds of past that are already
14:32
being produced and out there in the
14:34
environment and why those six exactly I
14:37
mean is it because those are the ones
14:39
responsible for most of the harm those
14:42
are the ones that the EPA has seen
14:45
enough evidence about that they are
14:48
confident that they are probably causing
14:51
harm but it doesn't mean that the other
14:53
ones are not also doing something
14:56
similar it's just sort of impossible for
15:00
researchers to be able to test each
15:03
individual chemical compound and try to
15:05
link it to a health outcome I talked to
15:09
a lot of researchers who were involved
15:11
in this area and they said that you know
15:13
they haven't really seen a past that
15:16
doesn't have a harm but they just don't
15:19
have information on the vast majority of
15:22
these compounds so in other words we
15:25
just haven't studied the rest of them
15:27
enough yet to even know how harmful they
15:30
actually are which is kind of alarming
15:33
yeah that's right and there's just new
15:34
ones coming out all the time right okay
15:38
so of the six that the EPA is actually
15:41
intending to regulate though are those
15:43
new regulations strict enough to keep
15:46
these chemicals out of our bodies so the
15:49
regulations for those six chemicals
15:52
really only cover getting them out of
15:55
the drinking water and drinking water
15:58
only really accounts for about 20% of a
16:03
person's overall P exposure wow so only
16:07
a fifth of the total exposure yeah there
16:10
are lots of other ways that you can come
16:13
into contact with past we eat past we
16:17
inhale past we rub it on our skin it's
16:20
in so many different products and
16:22
sometimes those products are not ones
16:24
that you would necessarily think of
16:26
they're in carpets they're in furniture
16:29
they're in dental floss raincoat vinyl
16:33
flooring artificial turf all kinds of
16:37
products that you want to be either
16:38
waterproof or stain resistant or both
16:42
have these chemicals in them so the
16:44
cities and towns are going to have to
16:47
figure out how to test for and monitor
16:51
for these six kinds of pasas and then
16:54
they're also going to have to figure out
16:56
how to filter them out of the water
16:58
supply
16:59
I think a lot of people are concerned
17:02
that this is going to be just a really
17:04
expensive Endeavor and it's also not
17:08
really going to take care of the entire
17:11
problem right and if you step back and
17:13
really look at the bigger problem the
17:15
companies are still making these things
17:17
right I mean we're running around trying
17:18
to regulate the stuff at the end stage
17:21
but these things are still being dumped
17:23
into the
17:24
environment yeah I think it's like a
17:27
huge criticism of our you know
17:31
regulatory policy there's a lot of onus
17:35
put on the EPA to prove that a harm has
17:39
happened once the chemicals are already
17:41
out there and then to regulate the
17:43
chemicals and I think that there's a
17:46
criticism that we should do things the
17:49
other way around right and so tougher
17:51
regulations on the front end before it
17:54
goes out into the environment and that's
17:56
sort of what the European Union has been
17:59
doing the European chemicals agency puts
18:03
more of the burden on companies to prove
18:06
that their products and their chemicals
18:08
are safe and the European chemicals
18:11
agency is also right now considering
18:14
just a ban on all P products so is that
18:19
a kind of model perhaps that a of what a
18:22
tough regulation could look like in the
18:25
US there's two sides to that question
18:29
and the first side is that a lot of
18:32
people feel like it would be better if
18:35
these chemical companies had to meet a
18:38
higher standard of proof in terms of
18:41
demonstrating that their products or
18:44
their chemicals are going to be safe
18:46
once they've been put out in the
18:47
environment the other side is that doing
18:50
that kind of upfront research can be
18:53
really expensive and could potentially
18:56
limit companies who are trying to
19:00
innovate in that space in terms of past
19:03
specifically you know this is a really
19:04
important chemical for us and a lot of
19:08
the things that we use it in there's not
19:10
necessarily a great replacement at the
19:13
ready that we can just swap in and so
19:15
you know it's used in all sorts of like
19:17
really important medical devices or
19:21
renewable energy Industries or
19:24
firefighting foam and in some cases
19:27
there are alter Alternatives that might
19:29
be safer that companies can use but in
19:32
other cases they just don't have that
19:34
yet and so p is still really important
19:38
to our daily lives right and and that
19:41
kind of leaves us in a pickle right
19:43
because we know these things might be
19:45
harming us yet we're kind of stuck with
19:48
them at least for now so let me just ask
19:51
you this question Kim which I've been
19:53
wanting to ask you since the beginning
19:55
of this episode which is if you're a
19:57
person who is concerned about your
19:59
exposure to pasas what do you do yeah so
20:03
this is really tricky and I asked
20:05
everybody this question who I talk to
20:08
and everybody has you know a little bit
20:10
of a different answer based on their
20:12
circumstance for me what I ended up
20:15
doing was getting rid of the things that
20:18
I could sort of spot and get rid of and
20:21
so you know I got rid of some Carpeting
20:23
and I checked you know when I was buying
20:27
my son a raincoat that it was was you
20:29
know made by a company that didn't use
20:32
P it's also expensive right and so if
20:36
you can afford to get a raincoat from a
20:39
place that doesn't manufacture P it's
20:41
going to cost more than if you buy you
20:44
know the budget raincoat and so you know
20:47
it's kind of unfair to put the onus on
20:50
consumers in that way and it's also just
20:54
not necessarily clear where exactly your
20:57
exposure is coming from from so you know
20:59
I talk to people who said well you know
21:01
it's in dust so I vacuum a lot or you
21:05
know it's in my cleaning products so I
21:07
use natural cleaning products and so I
21:10
think it's really sort of a scattershot
21:13
approach that consumers can take but I
21:16
don't think that there is a magic
21:18
approach that gets you a past free life
21:23
so Kim this is pretty dark I have to say
21:26
and I think what's frustrating is that
21:28
it feels like we have these government
21:31
agencies that you know are supposed to
21:33
be protecting our health but when you
21:35
drill down here the guidance is really
21:38
more like you know you're on your own I
21:40
mean it's hard not to just throw up your
21:42
hands and say I give
21:45
up yeah I think it's really tricky to
21:49
try to know kind of what you do with all
21:53
of this information as an individual as
21:56
much as you can you can try to your
21:58
individual exposure but it seems to me
22:00
as though it's at kind of a a regulatory
22:04
level that meaningful change would
22:06
happen and not so much you know throwing
22:09
out your pots and pans and getting new
22:13
ones one thing about p is just that
22:18
we're in the stage still of trying to
22:21
understand exactly what it's doing
22:23
inside of us and so there's a certain
22:25
amount of research that has to happen
22:28
happen in order to both convince people
22:31
that there's a real problem that needs
22:33
to be solved and clean up what we've put
22:36
out there and so I think that we're sort
22:40
of in the middle of that Ark and I think
22:43
that that's the point at which people
22:46
