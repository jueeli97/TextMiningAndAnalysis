The Billionaires’ Secret Plan to Solve California’s Housing Crisis



0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael Babar
0:04
this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:10
day for years a mysterious company has
0:13
been buying Farmland on the outskirts of
0:16
Silicon Valley eventually putting
0:18
together a plot twice the size of San
0:21
Francisco but at every step Those Behind
0:24
the company kept their plans for the
0:26
land shrouded in secrecy until my
0:30
colleague Connor dhy figured out who
0:33
they were and what they were up
0:36
[Music]
0:41
[Applause]
0:46
to it's Monday March
0:49
[Music]
0:53
11th so Connor this Story begins as a
0:57
real estate mystery that you took it
0:59
upon yourself to to try to crack wide
1:01
open so tell us about where this mystery
1:04
unfolds okay so if you imagine you're in
1:07
San Francisco and you drive north
1:10
further up into the Bay Area into an
1:12
area called Solano County and then you
1:15
go Way East and you end up in this very
1:18
rural corner of the Bay Area that not a
1:20
lot of people know about and it's over
1:22
here in this rural corner of Solano
1:24
County where our story takes
1:28
place and it's these open sort of
1:31
rolling landscape of yellow Hills with
1:34
almost nothing on it the largest
1:36
structures there are wind turbines and a
1:40
lot of the families out there are
1:42
farmers they farm sheep feed crops and
1:46
cows and many of the people out there
1:49
have been there since like the 1860s
1:51
this is a place where families stay in
1:54
the same place for generations and pass
1:56
the Farms down several times this is is
1:59
a place where not a lot
2:01
changes but then in 2017 something very
2:05
unusual starts to
2:08
happen a company called Flannery
2:12
Associates which nobody in the area has
2:15
ever heard of starts buying land and
2:18
they buy more the next year the year
2:20
after that the year after that more and
2:22
more and more and more until pretty
2:24
quickly they're the biggest land owner
2:26
in the entire County H so all these
2:30
neighbors are at supermarkets they're at
2:31
church they're at schools that I mean
2:33
this is a place where everyone knows
2:34
everyone they're all on community boards
2:36
together they all talk to each other all
2:38
the time they all sort of simultaneously
2:42
get these offers for their land right
2:46
and like you said they don't even know
2:47
who the offer is coming from all they
2:50
know is that a very aggressive as we say
2:53
in New York highly motivated buyer is in
2:56
their midst exactly highly motivated
2:59
buyer so
3:00
they not only want everyone's Farm they
3:02
start offering people these incredibly
3:04
sweetheart deals which say okay well I'm
3:08
going to buy your land but you can stay
3:10
there for the next decade or two
3:11
depending on how old they are and for
3:14
all that time you can collect all the
3:16
income from this land I don't even want
3:18
the income of the land so one thing
3:20
everyone realizes pretty quickly is
3:22
these people are not interested in
3:25
farming cuz if they wanted to farm they
3:27
would kick the farmers off the land they
3:29
had just spot or they would want to make
3:31
money from farming like they don't care
3:34
about the price that reflects the income
3:36
and they don't even care about
3:37
collecting the income so they very
3:39
obviously have a plan that has nothing
3:41
to do with farming and so the question
3:43
is what's the plan and who are these
3:45
people right so then the county starts
3:49
to get curious who this is but because
3:51
this flry Associates is Incorporated in
3:54
Delaware which has some specific rules
3:56
that kind of cloak who is behind a
3:58
company nobody can figure out who they
4:00
are and they send a bunch of letters to
4:03
the company Flannery Associates lawyer
4:05
and this lawyer kind of just puts them
4:08
off and says oh don't worry about it
4:10
this is a group of wealthy families who
4:13
are looking to diversify their assets
4:15
and they just want to park it in
4:17
Farmland basically H local Mayors
4:21
concerned citizens are going down to the
4:23
libraries and pulling property records
4:26
and you know looking up corporate llc's
4:28
and stuff to sort of try to figure out
4:30
who is behind this mhm the county
4:32
becomes very concerned about what is
4:35
happening here there's this massive
4:37
information vacuum and people start to
4:40
fill
4:41
it we're talking about Solano County
4:44
where the single largest landowner is
4:46
now an LLC based in Delaware the group
4:49
Flannery Associates has acquired tens of
4:52
thousands of Acres of dry Farmland
4:54
equivalent to nearly double the size of
4:55
San Francisco and no one knows why so
4:59
what whatever they are I know what they
5:00
aren't they aren't buying carbon credits
5:03
you know they have intentions that are
5:05
outside of our usual land use ideas
5:08
that's what makes it scary I guess is
5:10
that we don't we know nothing about them
5:13
now there's an important detail here
5:14
that I've sort of left out which is a
5:16
mysterious purchase of dry Farmland near
5:19
Travis Air Force Base one of the most
5:21
critical military bases in the western
5:23
USU has raised serious
5:25
questions all of this land is near and
5:28
surround
5:30
Travis Air Force Base which is a very
5:32
important Strategic Air Force Base
5:34
sometimes called the gateway to the
5:36
Pacific and the concern is that a
5:38
foreign actor of some kind spies
5:41
basically is buying up a bunch of land
5:43
around an Air Force Base that it may
5:45
very well be Chinese money with a goal
5:48
of surveilling it or something like that
5:50
for a enemy to be able to be right next
5:54
to the base to monitor to listen into
5:57
the communications it would certainly be
5:59
possible to do that if you own the land
6:02
adjacent to the fence line of Travis Air
6:04
Force Base there's never any evidence of
6:07
all this but because of where the land
6:10
is situated around this base right it's
6:12
a somewhat Reasonable Suspicion yes so
6:15
by 2023 members of Congress all sorts of
6:19
people are flipping out the defense
6:21
department starts investigating this the
6:23
FBI starts investigating this the state
6:26
department starts investigating this all
6:28
of these agencies are
6:31
investigating who is behind this company
6:34
you know just anything you can come up
6:36
with people have thrown the idea out
6:39
except for what it turns out to
6:42
[Music]
6:47
be so I cover housing here and this was
6:51
a little off my beat but I was very
6:54
interested so I started looking into it
6:57
a little bit and made a couple calls but
6:59
I didn't turn up much then one day
7:02
pretty much out of the blue I get a
7:04
message and I can't exactly say where or
7:07
how or from whom H but someone tells me
7:10
I know what this is tantalizing this
7:13
isn't some group of Rich families trying
7:15
to park their cash in Farmland like the
7:18
Flannery Associates lawyer implied this
7:21
is at least according to this tip some
7:23
of the most powerful people in
7:25
technology Venture capitalists
7:27
Executives from Silicon Valley
7:30
buying this land and they're trying to
7:32
round up other investors to join them
7:34
huh so now you have a theory about who
7:37
is buying this land it's a bunch of
7:38
really rich Venture Capital types from
7:40
Silicon Valley but at this point you
7:42
don't really know if that's actually
7:45
true totally and as you know you get a
7:48
lot of tips as a reporter some of them
7:51
sound quite extraordinary and turn out
7:54
to be nothing but for various reasons
7:56
that I can't get into I sort of knew
7:59
this had to be worth checking out mhm so
8:03
I call basically you know everyone I've
8:05
ever met I mean I'm kidding but I start
8:08
just blitzing the phones right I am
8:10
sitting there texting calling just
8:13
trying to find anybody who might know
8:15
anything about this in this kind of
8:16
Nexus I think the technical term is dog
8:19
with a bone yes so then I started
8:21
working with my colleague Aaron Griffith
8:22
who covers Venture Capital mhm and
8:25
eventually through a ton of reporting we
8:28
were able to conf affirm that yes in
8:30
fact the money behind Flanery Associates
8:33
was a who's who of Silicon
8:37
Valley Loren pal jobs the Widow of Apple
8:41
co-founder Steve Jobs Mark Andre very
8:44
famous venture capitalist from Andres
8:46
and Horowitz right Michael Moritz
8:49
billionaire venture capitalist from a
8:51
company called seoa Capital Reed Hoffman
8:55
co-founder of
8:56
LinkedIn some of the richest people on
8:58
earth
8:59
are actually the ones buying all this
9:02
farmland and the craziest thing is what
9:04
I learned their plan was to take all
9:08
this land an area about twice the size
9:10
of San Francisco on this Farmland
9:13
building totally from scratch a brand
9:16
new city that they hoped would help
9:20
solve California's housing crisis and
9:24
beyond that create an entirely new model
9:27
for building communities in this
9:30
[Music]
9:41
[Music]
9:42
country we'll be right
9:46
back so what do you end up learning
9:48
Connor about the specific plan that all
9:52
these rich folks have for this model
9:55
City that they want to build on this
9:58
farmland
9:59
so this whole thing I learned is the
10:03
plan of a guy named
10:06
Yanik and who's that Jan shik is an
10:09
interesting guy he's originally from the
10:11
Czech Republic and in his telling he
10:14
grew up in this Tiny Town of a thousand
10:16
people but he's this very precocious
10:19
entrepreneurial young guy according to
10:22
him he brought internet to his town and
10:25
actually cut a side deal for himself to
10:27
get money for this is always looking for
10:29
an angle and with the help of different
10:32
scholarships he studied at Cambridge
10:35
goes to the London School of economics
10:37
and becomes a star Trader at Goldman
10:40
Sachs he leaves Goldman Sachs and
10:43
eventually makes his way to California
10:45
where he does several startups that have
10:47
a pretty mixed record of success and one
10:50
thing to know about Yan is that he's
10:51
really enamored with the culture of
10:53
Silicon Valley he loves the startup
10:56
thing he loves the feeling of the way
10:59
people in Silicon Valley try to blend
11:00
this kind of philanthropic message with
11:03
capitalism that we're saving the world
11:04
and we're going to make a bundle doing
11:06
it like this whole sort of spirit of
11:08
Silicon Valley all of this appeals to
11:10
him but there's one thing he really
11:12
doesn't like especially being a a
11:15
European he hates the
11:19
place he likes the culture but he hates
11:21
the physical Place hates the physical
11:23
place now if you've ever spent time in
11:25
Silicon Valley it's really not a very
11:27
remarkable place it's very sprawled out
11:30
you go to like Sand Hill Road which is
11:32
where all the biggest Venture
11:33
capitalists are and it's like this like
11:35
kind of crappy office complex there are
11:39
of course some very beautiful wealthy
11:40
neighborhoods but a lot of the housing
11:41
stock is he these kind of called the
11:44
sacki whatever you would sort of you
11:46
know stereotype as the kind of American
11:48
suburb it just feels like that so not
11:51
only is he sort of uninspired by this
11:54
very low density landscape there's a
11:57
huge housing crisis in California at
11:59
this time and not only is a huge housing
12:01
crisis there's just a ton of conflict
12:04
over whether or not the state should
12:06
build more you know how it should build
12:08
it's just a big fight over basically
12:11
whether to even solve it so he is coming
12:14
to this all very fresh you know the idea
12:17
that there's this place where people
12:19
start big companies and investors give
12:22
young guys millions of dollars to chase
12:25
their crazy idea I mean this just seems
12:27
like paradise to him and allowing more
12:30
people to move here you know building
12:32
tons more housing building great
12:34
buildings that's what he thinks should
12:36
be happening got it so his argument
12:38
basically is that a place as magnetic
12:41
and energetic and influential as the Bay
12:45
Area as Silicon Valley deserves a
12:47
physical Community worthy of all those
12:51
qualities that does not exist in fact
12:54
it's the opposite yes 100% now that
12:59
feeling that Yan's expressing that
13:01
Silicon Valley in San Francisco can do
13:03
better that it's become too hard to
13:05
build in California that this vibrant
13:08
place has gotten stuck that feeling is
13:11
shared by a lot of very rich and
13:13
powerful people in particular in the
13:16
venture capital and Tech Community there
13:19
is this very deep frustration in that
13:22
world that as much influence as they've
13:25
had on the digital world they've had
13:27
very little influence on the physical
13:29
world I mean these are people who grew
13:31
up dreaming of flying cars and you know
13:35
monals through Sim City Landscapes that
13:39
sort of thing and yet they live in this
13:42
strip mall office complex culdesac
13:46
suburb and because of the politics of
13:48
the state it's almost impossible for
13:50
them to change that people talk
13:53
constantly about this and Yan at this
13:56
point is extremely well connected he is
13:59
friends with billionaires he's in a book
14:01
club with some pretty high powerered
14:02
Venture capitalists so he puts together
14:04
a plan for a new community in eastern
14:07
Solano County one that lives up to his
14:10
vision and one that he brings to these
14:12
people and eventually he's got almost a
14:16
billion dollars to pursue this idea of
14:19
building an entirely New City from
14:21
scratch out in this rural area so Conor
14:25
what happens once you and the times
14:27
break the story and tell world what's
14:29
really going on because it's been so
14:31
secretive and mysterious until that
14:33
point so within an hour or two of us
14:36
breaking the story Yan's LinkedIn page
14:45
reidentified and California forever has
14:48
taken its place it's a whole new company
14:51
with a whole new name and a very
14:53
friendly face and not only that is as
14:56
public as you can be you know it goes
14:58
from black box that nobody can get in to
15:01
a company that has opened four offices
15:04
around Solano County so that you can
15:06
walk in and go hey how are you doing
15:07
what's this project and learn about it
15:09
and see maps and talk to people about it
15:11
wow a company that has put Billboards
15:13
all over the 8 freeway on the way up to
15:16
Sacramento saying California forever so
15:19
they've gone from nothing to you can't
15:21
stop hearing about them well what
15:24
exactly are they saying once they decide
15:26
to acknowledge what they are Rebrand
15:29
themselves and start having what sounds
15:31
like the beginning of a conversation yes
15:33
with the people in this County so
15:35
because of county law they cannot build
15:38
this city unless they get a vote of the
15:40
people ah right California is among
15:43
other things land of the ballot
15:44
initiative exactly Solano County has a
15:47
rule that says you can't build in the
15:49
rural areas and that's because they want
15:51
to preserve these Farms just as they've
15:54
been for Generations so at the start of
15:56
this year California forever filed a
15:59
proposed ballot initiative that would
16:01
undo that and pave the way for them to
16:04
eventually build this
16:06
city and the hope is that this
16:09
initiative would go before Solano County
16:12
voters in
16:13
November good evening good evening
16:16
everyone thank you for being here how
16:18
how's everyone doing tonight great thank
16:21
you for coming they have to go on this
16:23
massive charm offensive because not only
16:25
do they have to eventually convince
16:27
elected official and all these people to
16:29
give them know permission to build thank
16:31
you for coming out and learning about
16:33
this California forever project you've
16:35
been hearing it a lot about it in the
16:37
media and we're here to get your
16:39
questions answered we know everybody's
16:40
got a lot of questions so they have to
16:42
get the whole County to vote
16:45
affirmatively for this project so uh Yan
16:49
take it away so Yan goes from nobody has
16:52
heard of yan to he's everywhere in the
16:55
county he's meeting with elected
16:56
officials he's meeting with you union
16:58
leaders um good evening everyone thank
17:01
you for coming to introduce myself um
17:03
you might be asking yourself why is this
17:05
guy with a funny accent here and then he
17:07
starts having a series of public town
17:10
hall meetings in all these different
17:12
cities across Sano County this
17:15
acceleration in home prices and pushing
17:17
of particularly working-class families
17:18
out of California has been building up
17:20
since the 80s and he just begins
17:23
pitching people every 5 years it gets
17:25
worse and it gets worse and it gets
17:27
worse and it gets worse and the pitch
17:29
really begins with all the huge problems
17:32
California is facing right now and so
17:35
where our project times in together with
17:36
this is that we do think that we need to
17:39
revisit some of these ideas and we need
17:41
to look into if our kids are going to be
17:43
able to live in California if California
17:45
is going to be a state that does
17:48
something about homelessness if
17:49
California and he really says I have an
17:51
answer to what is ailing us we need to
17:53
build again we need to think big again
17:57
that this is what California need needs
17:58
to essentially shock itself out of its
18:01
current malaise um new community homes
18:04
in safe workable neighborhoods good
18:06
paying local jobs locally owned shops
18:08
and businesses big employers make it big
18:11
enough to be an economic engine for
18:12
everyone make it big enough he says
18:14
we're going to build roow houses with
18:17
bike lanes and a dense city with a bus
18:20
running around the perimeter of it where
18:22
you can walk to shops it basically
18:25
describes Brooklyn where you live or
18:28
you're sitting and we went out and uh we
18:31
found a group of investors who wanted to
18:33
double down in California and who
18:35
believed that if you could purchase
18:36
enough property that you could design a
18:38
project that was designed in a way that
18:41
it made everyone around better and
18:43
eventually this city they hope will have
18:47
400,000 people living
18:50
[Music]
18:54
there a from scratch fully envisioned
18:57
dense L constructed Community where you
19:00
go to work you go to the theater you do
19:03
your grocery shopping all within walking
19:05
distance of your row house which is
19:07
attached to another house which is
19:09
exactly the kind of dense style of
19:11
living that urban planners say we should
19:13
be having in this country more of it not
19:16
less of it
19:18
exactly Conor all of this sounds
19:21
eminently reasonable that I wonder why
19:24
Yan approached it from the beginning
19:27
with so much
19:28
secrecy and mystery because that doesn't
19:31
feel in keeping with the spirit of what
19:33
he is talking about here yes well pretty
19:37
simple answer there money what Yan will
19:40
tell you is that they were worried that
19:42
people would jack up the prices of the
19:44
land if they were public yes that if
19:47
people out there realized that the
19:49
richest people in the world had a plan
19:51
to buy all this land they would start
19:54
raising the prices got it but at the
19:56
same time it created a ton of Suspicion
19:59
in this community and on top of that
20:01
it's possible some of these Farmers
20:03
might not have sold if they would have
20:05
known what the plans were you know many
20:08
of these people have a a very deep
20:10
connection to the idea of this as an
20:13
agricultural Place well to that point
20:15
what happens once the public and all the
20:18
farmers who have sold their land learn
20:20
precisely what the plan is and what they
20:23
have sold their land off to become so
20:26
people are incredibly unhappy about it
20:30
so I go to the town hall and right off
20:32
the bat my question is where are you
20:35
making your money because it comes
20:36
across like you're doing a big favor for
20:39
all of us to build this but I know
20:41
you're looking for a bottom line so I'm
20:43
curious people contend that this is just
20:44
a plan to get rich if you get your way
20:46
you will get to build this giant City
20:48
and the land you bought for not very
20:49
much money will suddenly be worth
20:52
astronomical amount more and these
20:54
people who are already billionaires are
20:55
just going to get richer I am one of the
20:58
43 individuals that has been named in
21:01
the lawsuit because I own 200 acres of
21:04
land as they acquired the land they also
21:06
used some pretty significant Strongarm
21:08
tactics such as suing Farmers many of
21:11
whom were in a lawsuit with them during
21:13
the town hall will you commit to
21:16
dropping the lawsuit against the local
21:18
farmers who are not aligned with your
21:20
vision in a good will attempt to change
21:23
the way that you are interacting with
21:24
our community which is right now
21:26
unacceptable at one point this family
21:28
rose up and one after the other started
21:30
saying you're suing my family
21:32
flanner California forever's
21:35
divisiveness and deception are very well
21:38
documented then there's the more obvious
21:41
thing people say which is how do you
21:42
expect anyone in this room or the county
21:45
to believe what you are saying how do
21:47
you expect this to trust you after
21:49
you've been basically lying to us for 7
21:52
years I would like you to explain
21:55
further why you look at farmers who land
21:58
is more important to them than your
22:01
money why we are a
22:05
[Music]
22:07
problem this is a rural area and does
22:11
not want to be a city they have remained
22:14
here because they like being farmers and
22:16
they like being in a small town where
22:19
everyone knows each other and that is
22:21
the way of life to which they are
22:23
accustomed and many of these people will
22:25
tell you I know California has a housing
22:28
problem they are aware that there are
22:31
big cities not too far from them and
22:32
that they have significant
22:34
troubles but what they're saying is this
22:37
is Farmland if you want to sort of solve
22:40
San Francisco housing problems like
22:41
maybe you start in San Francisco right
22:44
no one there seemed particularly happy
22:46
about it right which does not seem like
22:48
a great sign if as you said earlier
22:51
Connor what California for needs most is
22:54
to hear from this community that it's
22:56
willing to vote to let this city get
22:58
built yes people are very skeptical of
23:01
them and i' I've even heard people who
23:03
are you know sort of more kind of
23:05
seasoned political people saying it's
23:08
very hard to trust them right now and if
23:10
I'm going to give them all this
23:12
affirmation in the form of a vote I need
23:14
to be pretty confident that they're
23:16
going to do what they say they're going
23:17
to do I mean there's a real irony here
23:20
which is that California forever thought
23:22
that the best way to
23:23
circumvent all of the normal screaming
23:27
and yelling and Community opposition and
23:29
bureaucracy and nimbyism of Big City
23:32
California was to escape to rural
23:36
California and try to build a brand new
23:40
model of Housing and Urban living there
23:44
and they ended up unleashing a different
23:46
but it sounds like no less Fierce
23:47
version of all those same forces just a
23:50
couple hours outside the city exactly
23:54
and I think they probably knew that
23:56
would happen and I think in a weird way
23:58
this is what they want what do you mean
24:01
why do they what do you mean they want
24:02
it I think in their mind it's almost
24:05
easier to build a city than it is to
24:08
build a duplex I think they would rather
24:11
have one big gigantic knockdown drag out
24:16
expensive fight H and then if they get
24:20
approval just build the city you know if
24:23
you think about it the problem in San
24:24
Francisco is that they fight over every
24:26
little duplex they fight over every
24:28
little apartment building and I think
24:30
they're sort of like okay let's do this
24:31
once let's have it be as Furious and
24:35
expensive as it can be and if we get
24:37
over that
24:38
hump then we can build a city that they
24:40
hope one day will have 400,000 people in
24:42
it and I think they've calculated if we
24:45
do this on this scale it'll be too big
24:47
to fail this is fascinating this project
24:50
is almost ideological for
24:52
Yan he knows that there's a huge
24:56
distrust of Silicon Valley and
24:58
billionaires and that many see his
25:00
approach as huis he's totally aware of
25:03
all of
25:06
this but this is a state that built the
25:09
Golden Gate Bridge and went from a
25:12
little Frontier Town to the largest
25:15
state and the fifth largest economy in
25:18
the entire world and I think there's a
25:21
feeling that it's forgotten how to do
25:23
those big
25:26
things and I think what Yan would tell
25:29
you his argument is somebody needs to
25:32
revive this Spirit somehow we need to
25:34
get
25:35
Californians excited about big things
25:38
again and if it's not this then what is
25:40
it and if it's not them then
25:42
[Music]
25:48
who well Connor Thank you very much we
25:51
appreciate it thank you
25:56
Michael
26:02
we'll be right
26:06
back here's what else you need to know
26:09
today the justice department has begun a
26:11
criminal investigation into the midair
26:14
blowout of a panel on an Alaska Airlines
26:17
flight that forced the plane to make an
26:19
emergency landing in January Federal
26:22
investigators have suggested that Boeing
26:24
may have delivered the plane to Alaska
26:27
Airlines without installing the bolts
26:30
necessary to hold the panel in
26:35
place and in an interview over the
26:37
weekend with MSNBC President Biden
26:40
delivered some of his harshest words to
26:42
date about Israel's deadly military
26:45
strategy in Gaza and about the man
26:48
leading it prime minister Benjamin
26:50
Netanyahu he's hurting I my view he's
26:54
hurting Israel more than helping Israel
26:57
by making the rest of the world it's
26:59
contrary to what Israel stands for and I
27:01
think it's a big mistake so I want to
27:03
see a ceasefire in the interview Biden
27:06
was asked if there was a point at which
27:08
netanyahu's actions would compel the US
27:11
to cut off military aid to Israel but
27:15
there's red lines that if he crosses in
27:17
the he cannot have 30,000 more
27:20
Palestinians
