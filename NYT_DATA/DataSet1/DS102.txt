What Happens if America Turns Its Back on Its Allies in Europe



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Katherine
0:02
benold and this is the
0:06
daily over the past few weeks a growing
0:09
sense of alarm across Europe has turned
0:12
into outright panic over the future of
0:14
its security Ukrainian troops have
0:16
withdrawn from the key Eastern town of a
0:20
divka as Russia is advancing on the
0:22
battlefield in Ukraine Congressional
0:24
inaction has meant that Ukrainian forces
0:26
were outgunned they were outmanned and
0:28
they were ultimately forced to withdraw
0:31
the US Congress has refused to pass
0:33
billions of dollars in new funding for
0:35
Ukraine's war effort NATO was busted
0:39
until I came along I said everybody's
0:41
going to pay they said well if we don't
0:43
pay are you still going to protect us I
0:45
said Absolut Donald Trump the leading
0:47
Republican presidential candidate has
0:49
warned European leaders that if they
0:51
don't pay their fair share towards NATO
0:54
no I would not protect you in fact I
0:56
would encourage them to do whatever the
0:58
hell they want you got to pay you got to
1:00
pay he would encourage Russia to attack
1:02
them and condemnation is ringing out
1:05
tonight after news Russian opposition
1:07
leader Alexi navali has died Russia's
1:11
loudest voice of internal dissent Alexi
1:13
naali has died in prison make no mistake
1:17
Putin is responsible for naval's
1:21
death today my colleague Steven erlinger
1:25
on Europe's plans to defend itself
1:27
against Russia without the help of the

NATO
1:45
21st Steve you are conveniently for the
1:49
purposes of this conversation at a major
1:51
conference devoted to the security of
1:53
Europe which for a variety of reasons is
1:56
feeling very insecure at the moment
1:58
insecure because of what Donald Trump
2:00
just said and because Russia seems to be
2:03
defeating Ukraine in some key battles
2:06
and so I'm curious what the mood has
2:08
been at this conference well the mood is
2:11
a little unmowed and
2:13
shaky this is a conference of security
2:16
people of officials diplomats but in a
2:20
way it's like a security analyst Tinder
2:23
you're always running into all kinds of
2:26
people and people who care desperately
2:29
about
2:30
what Russia's doing what Ukraine's doing
2:33
what America's doing and the mood has
2:37
gotten panicky here so while we're
2:41
here navali dies which shook quite a lot
2:45
of people Russia made a serious advance
2:49
in Ukraine over the weekend they took a
2:52
town after many months of fighting
2:54
called aiva which was an important
2:57
Crossroads town and one had the
3:01
feeling that with Aid to Ukraine stuck
3:05
in
3:06
Congress that of divka was just the
3:09
beginning of a Ukrainian
3:13
pullback and it's against that backdrop
3:16
that the comments from Donald Trump are
3:18
particularly worrying Donald Trump is
3:21
like this big Shadow over everything
3:23
nobody knows whether he's going to be
3:24
reelected or not but what he said about
3:27
NATO undermined the whole idea of the
3:30
alliance which has kept the peace in
3:32
Europe since the end of World War II so
3:35
people are quite nervous about what he
3:37
said and that the transactional
3:40
unpredictable Donald Trump who seems to
3:42
govern from his stomach will somehow put
3:45
a big hole in the credibility of the
3:47
alliance just as Russia is increasing
3:50
its aggression against Ukraine and when
3:53
you say undermining potentially the
3:55
alliance you're essentially talking
3:57
about Article 5 of the NATO Charter
4:01
yes and Article 5 is a key part of the
4:05
founding agreement of NATO
4:09
1949 and it basically says that an
4:12
attack on one member should be
4:14
considered an attack on every member now
4:18
countries then have the right to decide
4:20
how to respond to that attack but the
4:23
idea is all for one and one for all that
4:27
if a little country's part of NATO is
4:29
attacked then all countries of NATO
4:32
would come to its defense okay so Europe
4:36
depends on NATO for its security and
4:39
NATO depends on the credibility of the
4:41
article 5 guarantee from the US which
4:44
Trump is basically
4:46
undermining yes but then again we've
4:50
heard Trump make comments like these
4:52
before on NATO I mean he called NATO
4:54
obsolete when he was president so why
4:57
are these latest remarks Mak making such
5:00
big waves well the first change from
5:02
before is there's a war in Europe now
5:05
not against a NATO member but there is a
5:09
serious land war in Europe by a Russia
5:13
that has invaded a neighboring country
5:16
and it has created fear that if Russia
5:21
succeeds in its efforts in Ukraine that
5:26
other former Soviet block countries that
5:29
are now part of NATO could be next
5:31
particularly the Baltic Nations and
5:35
secondly there's obviously the prospect
5:37
that Donald Trump's going to be
5:38
president again so this really shakes
5:41
people up I mean Trump certainly isn't
5:43
the first American President to raise
5:46
this question of underwhelming European
5:50
spending on its own defense and it has
5:54
been true part of what he said is Europe
5:58
has been complacent
6:00
since the collapse of the Soviet Union
6:03
Europeans have spent less and less money
6:06
on defense and they have relied on the
6:10
United States to protect them without
6:13
making a fair contribution to their own
6:16
security this was an issue under
6:19
Republican presidents under democratic
6:21
presidents Harry Truman first complained
6:24
about Europeans not spending enough on
6:27
their militaries but Trump was certainly
6:29
the most outspoken and the first to
6:32
issue threats of a Kind it's interesting
6:35
so you kind of explained that one reason
6:37
Trump's comments have caused such a
6:39
panic here in Europe is that the
6:41
scenario of a Russian invasion is no
6:43
longer academic it's actually happening
6:46
and of course unlike the US Europe
6:47
shares a whole continent with Russia so
6:49
is arguably feeling that threat and that
6:52
risk much more
6:54
immediately how did Europe given this
6:57
geography allow itself to become become
6:59
so strategically dependent on the US how
7:02
did we get here well it's a long story
7:06
of course I mean let's go back to the
7:08
end of World War II obviously and the
7:10
defeat of Nazi
7:15
Germany it became quickly clear that
7:18
Stalin and the Soviet Union intended to
7:21
keep the territories in Eastern Europe
7:24
it occupied and this became a big
7:27
ideological battle communism versus
7:31
democracy and NATO was set up in
7:34
1949 basically is's a cliche but it's
7:38
really true to keep the Russians out to
7:41
keep the Germans down and to keep the
7:44
Americans in because the United States
7:47
after World War I went home which some
7:50
people blame for allowing World War II
7:53
to actually
7:55
happen so this time the Americans stayed
7:59
at one point in the early 1950s the
8:02
Europeans tried to create their own
8:04
defense Community but they couldn't
8:06
really get their act together and always
8:09
it was dependent in security terms on
8:13
the American military power and the
8:16
American nuclear umbrella and it seemed
8:19
to suit everybody just fine so in a
8:22
sense that European dependence on
8:24
America was baked in and even tolerated
8:27
if not even wanted by the Americans in
8:30
those days yes and that's a very good
8:32
point because frankly it was in the
8:34
American interest to be honest for trade
8:37
reasons for Alliance reasons to have a
8:41
very powerful position inside Europe and
8:44
when you combined it with an aggressive
8:47
Soviet communism at the time it seemed
8:51
to serve everybody's interests including
8:53
America's national
8:55
[Music]
8:58
interest
Peace Dividend
9:02
so this worked for quite a long time it
9:06
did and it kept the peace in Europe
9:09
which it really was intended to do but
9:12
as the cold war ends and the Soviet
9:15
Union falls apart for its own bad
9:20
structure I mean it was inevitably going
9:22
to fall apart suddenly the Europeans
9:25
think well the threat of war is over we
9:28
can relax we can have what came to be
9:32
called the peace dividend we can stop
9:34
spending so much money on the military
9:36
because the idea of this broken Russia
9:41
invading the rest of Europe seemed
9:44
inconceivable so they stopped making
9:47
things like tanks and anti-tank weapons
9:51
and air defenses and they really cut way
9:54
back on the amount of money they were
9:57
spending and there was complet jcy even
10:00
when Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and
10:05
only 6 years later an nexted Crimea MH
10:09
so even at the same Munich security
10:13
conference two years ago on the eve of
10:17
the Russian invasion there was a strong
10:19
feeling even among Ukraine's president
10:23
volodimir zalinski that Russia would not
10:26
invade now the Americans and British
10:28
thought the Russians would invade but
10:30
Ukraine would collapse very quickly the
10:33
Germans and French thought Putin
10:35
wouldn't be so stupid to invade at all
10:39
so everyone in a way was wrong and
10:42
Ukraine of course isn't actually a NATO
10:45
member it isn't and yet Ukraine was a
10:49
kind of Frontier land between Russia and
10:53
NATO and once Russia started a war a
10:58
real War it really shook people and that
11:02
prompted the Biden
11:05
Administration and the European Union
11:07
and NATO to get their act together to
11:10
try to help Ukraine as best they could
11:13
to resist this Russian invasion so to
11:17
some degree NATO's help to Ukraine was
11:20
slow but it began to accelerate and no
11:23
one expected the war to go on this long
11:26
either and so now we're in a
11:29
difficult place where Ukraine is more on
11:32
the defensive and NATO countries are
11:36
running out of stocks because they had
11:39
lived on the peace dividend they stopped
11:41
making Munitions they stopped making
11:44
missiles they're using up what they have
11:47
to give to Ukraine and there's very
11:49
little left to give so in a way two
11:53
myths have tumbled with Russia's
11:54
invasion of Ukraine the first is that
11:57
Russia does not go to war with Europe
11:58
European countries and the second myth
12:01
is that Europe doesn't need to spend a
12:03
whole lot on its
12:05
military yes that's true and then
12:08
against this backdrop we also see the
12:10
United States publicly rethinking its
12:14
commitments partly because a new
12:16
generation in America is becoming a bit
12:19
more
12:22
[Music]
12:24
isolationist American funding for
12:26
Ukraine has been in political limit for
12:29
months and some people don't think it's
12:31
actually going to happen I mean Donald
12:34
Trump isn't even president and there's
12:37
strong opposition in the Republican
12:39
party which seems devoted to him and to
12:42
his policies to anything that would
12:45
offend him and he is against more Aid to
12:49
Ukraine so it has become increasingly
12:52
clear that the Europeans have to start
12:56
figuring out how to live in a world
12:59
where support from the United States is
13:02
less than it used to be it isn't
13:04
automatic and it may not be there at
13:08
[Music]
13:17
all we'll be right
13:27
back
Europes Future
13:29
so Steve Europe is really starting to
13:32
contend with this idea that they need to
13:34
prepare for a future where the US steps
13:37
back from its role as the main guaran of
13:39
security on the continent and this is of
13:42
course happening in the middle of a war
13:44
so the most immediate concern presumably
13:46
for the Europeans is how to continue
13:49
supporting
13:50
Ukraine yes that's absolutely right
13:52
because no one wants Ukraine to fall no
13:56
one wants Putin to have a victory
13:58
because there's nothing like a victory
14:00
to grow the appetite and they don't want
14:03
Russia to succeed so the most urgent
14:06
challenge is that Ukraine is going to
14:08
have a very difficult year because it is
14:11
already rationing its use of artillery
14:14
shells especially and there's very
14:17
little left to give to them this year
14:21
the Europeans for example have promised
14:24
to give Ukraine a million artillery
14:27
shells and they have barely come up with
14:30
half that figure because the peace
14:33
dividend meant that Europe stopped
14:36
ordering this kind of ammunition which
14:38
meant companies stopped making it shut
14:41
down factories getting them open again
14:44
takes a long time it takes 2 or three
14:47
years to get an ammunition Factory going
14:50
but the fact is all these efforts should
14:53
have started two years ago and they did
14:56
not so the cupboards are bare quite
14:58
literally but what would a more
15:01
strategically independent Europe a
15:03
Europe that sort of is responsible for
15:05
its own security actually look like well
15:07
there's always been this vision of a
15:09
European Army but the plan never gets
15:12
off the ground because Europe's not a
15:14
country to begin with and to send troops
15:17
into battle requires political
15:19
responsibility so who's going to be the
15:22
European political leader who everyone
15:25
in Europe agrees can order its own
15:28
citizens into battle just seems almost
15:32
impossible to Think Through it's a
15:34
Federation of Independent countries and
15:38
it will never have that kind of
15:40
collective military right 27 countries
15:43
trying to agree on one
15:45
commander-in-chief never going to happen
15:47
it's never going to happen now there are
15:48
other ideas for a European NATO which is
15:53
an Alliance of European countries maybe
15:56
with less America possibly with know
15:59
America that would agree much like NATO
16:02
does now on the best way to create
16:06
conventional deterrence for Europe which
16:09
could be done with a lot more money
16:11
being spent which nobody wants to do um
16:14
and some more sophisticated arms
16:17
Productions but the question will always
16:20
be how do you replace the American
16:22
nuclear deterrent that's a much harder
16:24
question so in conventional terms this
16:27
European Nao would be an organization
16:31
where European countries kind of provide
16:33
the overwhelming majority of the detered
16:37
as in troops and weaponry yes but it
16:39
would also require Europeans to
16:42
understand that deterrence matters that
16:46
military spending matters and countries
16:48
would have to agree to spend probably 4%
16:52
of GDP or more on defense which is Cold
16:55
War levels which politically would be
16:58
very very unpopular but at the same time
17:02
the Russian war in Ukraine has created
17:05
an enormous change and you have
17:08
intelligence agencies all over Western
17:10
Europe now publicly warning people about
17:14
a Russian threat that they never did
17:16
before and trying to get people to
17:19
prepare for a change in the way they
17:23
look at their own security that more
17:26
money needs to be spent
17:29
not just for other people but for
17:32
themselves so ironically perhaps Trump
17:36
and the US Congress maybe have forced
17:40
this conversation that the Europeans
17:42
needed to have for a long time yes I
17:44
mean there's nothing like scaring people
17:47
to get them to do things Trump the US
17:50
Congress and of course the Russian
17:52
invasion of Ukraine all those things
17:55
have been important to force Europeans
17:57
to begin begin to understand that they
18:00
need to do more about their own security
18:04
so we've spent this episode focusing on
18:08
Europe and the implications of a less
18:09
engaged America on the security of
18:12
Europe but what about the security of
18:14
America does it make sense for the US to
18:17
step back from the NATO alliance and
18:19
from Europe for that matter I mean Trump
18:22
is selling this as something that's in
18:24
America's interest but is it well this
18:27
will be one of the Great themes of the
18:29
American election I think because
18:32
President Biden has argued and has
18:35
believed for a long time that America
18:38
benefits from its alliances around the
18:41
world not just in Europe but in Asia
18:44
elsewhere that it has friends that it
18:47
has trading partners and Mr Trump
18:50
believes that
18:51
alliances bind the United States that
18:55
they reduce America's power to do what
18:59
it wants to do in its own National
19:02
interest so these are issues that
19:05
actually Americans will have to decide
19:07
upon where American interests lie and
19:11
the value of
19:15
alliances you know Steve as we've been
19:18
talking it actually sort of took me back
19:20
to Growing Up in Germany in the kind of
19:24
final years of the Cold War when war
19:27
with Russia was still a thing that
19:30
people worried about so in some ways the
19:35
front lines of this new conflict seem
19:37
very familiar they do seem familiar and
19:40
they seem familiar in a very depressing
19:43
way what you have is a Russia that
19:46
clearly has decided that it doesn't want
19:49
to stay in the boundaries that were left
19:54
after its defeat in the Cold War so it's
19:57
a d dangerous time and we're also in a
20:00
world that is much less clear than it
20:03
was during the Cold
20:05
War you have the rise of China you have
20:09
Iran being almost a nuclear State you
20:13
have disorder lots of
20:16
places it's not a neat world it's a
20:19
confusing
20:20
world and in the face of all that there
20:24
is the real
20:25
possibility that the United States
20:28
is
20:31
retreating Steve thank you for coming on
20:35
the
20:36

20:43
you tomorrow on the daily we'll look at
20:47
the Life and Legacy of Alexi navali the

20:51
critic who died last week in
20:54
prison we'll be right
20:57
back
21:08
here's what else you need to know today
21:10
on Tuesday the United States vetoed a
21:13
United Nation Security Council
21:15
resolution calling for an immediate
21:17
ceasefire in Gaza it is the third time
21:20
that Washington has blocked an effort by
21:22
the UN to put an immediate end to the
21:24
fighting the US is drafting its own
21:27
rival resolution that calls for a
21:29
temporary humanitarian ceasefire quote
21:32
as soon as
21:35
practical and days before a Republican
21:39
presidential primary on her home turf in
21:41
South Carolina Nikki Haley fought back
21:44
against growing calls for her to drop
21:46
out of the race and endorse the front
21:48
runner former president Donald Trump I
21:51
feel no need to Kiss the
21:54
Ring Haley said that unlike so many
21:56
fellow Republicans she was not afraid of
21:59
Trump's anger or retribution and would
22:01
remain in the race regardless of what
22:04
happens in the South Carolina primary
22:06
South Carolina will vote on Saturday but
22:09
on Sunday I'll still be running for
