Secure the Border, Say Republicans. So Why Are They Killing a Plan to Do That?



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Michael
0:03
buaro this is the
0:07
[Music]
0:13
daily for the past few weeks Democrats
0:16
and Republicans were closing in on a
0:18
game-changing deal to secure the US
0:21
Mexico border the kind of bipartisan
0:24
compromise that's unheard of in
0:26
contemporary Washington today car and
0:29
immersion on why that deal is falling
0:34
apart it's Thursday February
0:38
[Music]
0:42
1 so K we're here to perform a kind of
0:47
autopsy on a deal that might have been
0:50
to talk about a major bipartisan
0:52
immigration agreement that took form
0:54
over the past few weeks it was Champaign
0:56
by President Biden leaders from both
0:59
parties in the Senate to understand
1:01
exactly why in a divided dysfunctional
1:04
Washington it ever seemed like it had a
1:08
chance to become law and why in the end
1:11
it seems to have been derailed so where
1:14
does that story start so the Genesis of
The Genesis
1:17
all of this is really late last summer
1:19
when it starts to look like military
1:22
assistance for Ukraine which the United
1:23
States had been funding and giving to
1:25
this Ally since early 2022 to help them
1:28
fight off a Russian invas
1:30
is about to dry up it had never been
1:34
completely easy but it never been a
1:35
really serious challenge to get this
1:37
sort of money through Congress in
1:39
various tranches in the past year and a
1:41
half right but all of a sudden the
1:44
right-wing of the Republican party
1:46
starts to get really really stubborn
1:48
about saying we're not going to let you
1:50
have this money unless you give us
1:52
something that's important to us in
1:54
terms of National Security and that is
1:57
more border enforcement on the southern
1:59
border with Mexico hm so republicans in
Secure the Border
2:03
Congress say to the president you want
2:06
that funding to Ukraine to be consistent
2:08
the way it has been you're going to have
2:11
to give us greater Security on the US
2:15
Mexico border exactly it's a completely
2:19
unorthodox sort of a linkage the logic
2:21
that has been presented is that they're
2:23
both kind of National Security type
2:25
issues but the idea of linking the
2:28
Ukraine war to border security
2:30
it's fairly novel M and it's born out of
2:34
the political priorities of the people
2:36
who are pushing for that the same group
2:38
of Republicans that starts this push for
2:41
more border security measures more
2:42
enforcement they also just so happen to
2:45
be the people who never liked the idea
2:47
of sending all of this Aid to Ukraine in
2:49
the first place got
2:51
it and it only takes a couple of weeks
2:54
before this talking point that
2:55
originated in the right wing of the
2:57
Republican party but I am not inclined
2:59
to support any more you help to Ukraine
3:01
at this time if we want to take care of
3:03
an invasion we've got an invasion on
3:06
that southern border kind of takes over
3:08
the entire mainstream of the party I'm
3:10
for better security at our border I'm
3:11
also for supporting Ukraine I feel like
3:13
we got to negotiate decent Tandem and
3:15
you have many prominent Republicans in
3:18
the Senate too are you saying Ukraine
3:20
should not be a standalone it will not
3:22
be a standalone saying we're not going
3:24
to let Ukraine Aid get renewed unless
3:27
there's border security alongside of
3:32
[Music]
Ukraine Aid Deadline
3:36
it and things actually do hit a deadline
3:40
at the end of September where this
3:42
emergency aid that's been flowing for
3:43
Ukraine since the beginning of the war
3:45
they don't actually reauthorize it on
3:47
time H and so all of a sudden there's
3:50
this pause and everybody in the
3:52
Democratic party starts to panic you're
Democrats Panic
3:54
saying Republicans put their money where
3:55
their mouth is and they say this is not
3:57
just a talking point you're not gonna
3:59
get this aid for Ukraine at all we are
4:02
serious yeah and after this it becomes
4:05
very clear that Ukraine funding is not
4:07
going to go ahead unless there are some
4:09
border security measures attached to it
4:12
that leaves President Biden in a little
4:13
bit of a bind because he has staked a
4:17
lot of his legacy reputation on this
4:20
Ukraine war and it is the biggest
4:24
success of his foreign policy and so he
4:27
takes this very unorthodox very
4:29
surprising step of basically saying okay
4:34
I'll meet that demand I will tie these
4:35
two things together H and I cannot
4:38
overstate how much of an earthquake it
4:41
is that Biden actually took that step to
4:43
say I will accept the gop's ultimatum as
4:48
legitimate and actually come and try to
How Much of an Earthquake
4:51
meet it well just explain that why is
4:53
that such an earthquake given that you
4:56
just described this as a kind of
4:57
impossible bind for Biden well it flies
5:01
in the face of basically three or four
5:03
decades worth of what Democrats approach
5:05
has been to border security which is
5:07
that it's part of a bigger conversation
5:09
about immigration policy that has to
5:12
involve things like Pathways to
5:13
citizenship or putting more visas for
5:15
family reunification on the table or
5:18
something that isn't primarily policing
5:20
processing and shutting things down and
5:22
that's been the case going back to
5:23
basically the Reagan years since that's
5:25
the last time Congress actually managed
5:27
to pass a comprehensive Immigration
5:28
Reform Bill to split off border security
5:31
and say oh we'll do it alone and we
5:32
won't ask for anything really on the
5:34
immigration front that is breaking with
5:37
a whole lot of precedent that frankly a
5:39
lot of the democratic parties saw as
5:41
President Biden selling out on something
5:43
that was pretty fundamental to how they
5:45
approach this issue H you're saying this
This Is Revolutionary
5:47
is revolutionary because it violates a
5:51
long-standing democratic approach that
5:54
they will negotiate around reducing
5:57
migrant Crossings at the border they
5:59
will strength and border security if and
6:01
only if their approach to immigration is
6:06
kind of met halfway by
6:08
Republicans and in this instance Biden
6:11
is instead agreeing to negotiate a
6:14
tougher approach to the Border without
6:15
such halfway meeting from the other side
6:18
instead he's just doing it to get money
6:21
for Ukraine exactly and that is why
This Is For Ukraine
6:25
several Democrats see this as him
6:27
basically selling out immigrants and
6:29
giving up all the leverage that they
6:31
might have on border security to get
6:34
money for the next N9 months for Ukraine
6:37
however President Biden and the
6:39
Democrats who support him see this as a
6:41
potential opportunity yes Ukraine is a
6:44
problem a big problem but so is the
6:46
Border they are seeing the surge of
6:48
migrants come to the Border they are
6:49
seeing how many are being busted
6:51
internally into the country they are
6:52
seeing how tens of thousands are
6:54
flooding the streets of democratically
6:56
run cities like New York right and they
6:59
know that that's a huge political
7:01
liability for President Biden if he
7:02
doesn't do something to address it
7:05
before the November elections and so
7:07
tying these two things together
7:09
basically gives him a potential
7:10
opportunity to address two big issues
7:13
with one stone if it works so once Biden
7:17
takes this very unorthodox approach to
7:21
funding border security in order to get
7:23
this money for Ukraine what ends up
7:26
happening so this creates an opport
7:29
for a potentially huge deal on the
7:32
border a long shot the type of deal that
7:34
has eluded Congress for several decades
7:37
at this point and a core group of three
7:40
Senators starts entering this very
7:42
intense phase of negotiations they meet
7:45
on a near daily basis for months and
7:47
eventually they actually do coales
7:49
around a set of policies that they think
7:51
could work to actually clamp down on the
7:53
migration problem at the Border in a way
7:56
that both parties could stomach and what
What Do They Agree On
7:58
do they end up agreeing
8:02
on they agree that they need to make it
8:04
harder for people to claim Asylum
8:06
there's a lot of people making frivolous
8:07
Asylum claims who don't actually fear
8:09
persecution if they go home so they
8:11
agree to raise that
8:13
bar they agree to expand the capacity of
8:16
detention facilities because a lot of
8:18
the Republicans complaints are that
8:19
you're letting all these migrants just
8:21
run off into the country with no
8:23
guarantee that you can bring them back
8:24
to deport them later they should be in
8:26
detention centers so they agree to do
8:28
that and kind of most critically they
8:30
agree to basically limit the number of
8:33
people that can come into the country on
8:34
any given day and the way they Envision
8:36
doing that is if the number of migrants
8:39
that border patrol officers encounter
8:41
reaches an average of 5,000 per day it
8:44
would trigger an effective shutdown of
8:46
the
8:47
border
8:49
[Music]
The Trigger
8:52
huh that might sound like a lot 5,000
8:55
it's actually far fewer than what we see
8:57
now late last year there was an average
8:59
of about 8,000 people trying to cross in
9:01
every day so this trigger functions as a
9:04
fail safe that if all these other
9:06
measures they're putting out there can't
9:07
bring down the number of migrants coming
9:09
to the border at least there's this that
9:12
would actually shut things down so taken
Taken Together
9:14
together this seems like a pretty
9:16
restrictive set of policies at the
9:17
border and a lot like a republican
9:20
approach and you're saying this is what
9:22
a bipartisan group of senators comes
9:24
around to so on top of starting off
9:27
where Republicans wanted Biden to start
9:29
off in these
9:31
negotiations Biden and Democrats seem to
9:34
be willing to sign off on a bill that is
9:38
very much out of line with traditional
9:41
democratic approaches to the border and
9:43
immigration good afternoon everyone I'd
9:46
like to speak to you today about an
9:48
urgent
9:49
responsibility the Congress has toold
9:53
the National Security in the United
9:54
States they definitely are we need real
9:57
solutions I support real Solutions of
9:59
the Border President Biden comes out and
10:02
says we need this deal get this done in
10:05
terms of changes of policy and to
10:08
provide resources we need to the Border
10:09
I'm really to they change policy as well
10:13
and that he's willing to make very
10:14
serious pretty major concessions in the
10:17
Senate we see Senate Majority Leader
10:19
Chuck Schumer put pressure on the Senate
10:21
if we believe something is important and
10:23
urgent we should stay and get the job
10:26
done shimer even goes so far as to try
10:29
hold the senate in until the holidays in
10:31
the hopes they can speed together the
10:32
end of a deal members need to be here
10:35
next week we have to get this done and
10:39
it's not just the Democrats Republican
10:41
leaders are saying to themselves this is
10:42
an opportunity that's never going to be
10:44
repeated where you have Democrats this
10:45
willing to make this kind of a deal we
10:48
should take it and run with it and try
10:50
to make this
Trump and Republicans
10:54
work and so as you're nearing the end of
10:56
2023 getting into the beginning of 202
10:59
before it actually seems like it's a
11:01
possibility that there could be the
11:02
votes for this deal if they can just
11:03
finalize it in the
11:05
[Music]
11:09
Senate but it's a very different story
11:11
in the Republican Le house which has
11:13
been much more skeptical of a deal and
11:16
it's a very different story as former
11:18
president Trump who's still really the
11:20
leader of the Republican party starts to
11:23
rack up primary wins in Iowa and New
11:25
Hampshire and starts weighing in on this
11:27
deal in very un Savory
11:35
terms we'll be right
How this bipartisan immigration deal starts to unravel
11:40
back so Ken tell us exactly how at this
11:44
moment of Maximum possibility that this
11:47
bipartisan immigration deal starts to
11:51
unravel as we get into the new year the
11:54
opposition from the house starts to get
11:57
much more solidified you'd had a
11:59
situation where basically Mike Johnson
12:02
he's a new speaker he starts in his
12:04
office the end of October just as all
12:06
this stuff about the Border negotiations
12:08
and the Ukraine deal is just picking up
12:09
in the Senate and for a while he's
12:11
sounding like he might be open to it but
12:14
by the time you get to the beginning of
A humanitarian catastrophe
12:15
the new year yeah we have a humanitarian
12:18
catastrophe here and of course huge
12:20
National Security concerns before
12:23
actually Down On the Border if you don't
12:25
end Catch and Release as a policy if you
12:27
don't reinstitute in Mexico if you only
12:30
fix Asylum or parole and not these other
12:32
things then you don't solve the problem
12:34
you don't saying that he doesn't think
12:36
that this has legs that it does not go
12:38
far enough to secure the Border we're
12:40
just asking the White House to apply
12:42
common sense and they they seem to be
12:44
completely uninterested in doing so and
12:46
that's the point at which it becomes
12:47
clear that he has fully SED on the deal
Biden fully SED on the deal
12:51
and how much do you covering this take
12:54
that motivation at face value what's
12:57
really going on I mean if the the
12:58
Democrats have come this far and Senate
13:01
Republicans are pleased and pushing for
13:03
a deal what's really keeping the house
13:06
Speaker from seeing this as an
13:09
opportunity as well well the house
13:10
Speaker does come from the right wi of
13:12
the GOP he is inclined to say look we
13:15
need a lot of really Draconian
13:17
restrictions on the border to make sure
13:19
that it's actually enforced but there's
13:21
another element at play tier two the
Biden trashes the deal
13:23
so-called border security deal Biden is
13:26
gushing out and pushing out is not
13:28
designed to stop illegal immigration
13:31
it's designed who you know as we said by
13:34
mid January has reclaimed the mantle of
13:36
the GOP from winning these primary
13:38
contests as the leader of our party
13:42
there is zero chance I will support this
13:45
horrible open borders betrayal of
13:48
America and he is openly using that
13:51
Pulpit to trash this emerging deal and
13:54
tell Republicans to vote against it I'd
13:57
rather have no bill than a bad Bill a
13:59
bad Bill you can't have and that's what
14:01
was happening in the house and why I
Why Biden trashes the deal
14:04
mean what is his reasoning for trashing
14:06
a deal that starts to fulfill something
14:08
so Central to his identity as president
14:11
which is get tough on the border part of
14:13
it is that the deal doesn't go as far as
14:16
he would like to see it go it doesn't
14:18
restore all of the policies like remain
14:20
in Mexico and border wall construction
14:22
that he had pursued during his
14:23
presidency but part of it is also that
14:26
he doesn't want to give Biden in on this
14:30
it's an extremely compelling political
14:33
campaign issue for him with his base and
14:36
if the Senate makes a bipartisan deal
14:38
and a bunch of Republicans are endorsing
14:40
that bipartisan deal it becomes harder
14:42
for him to say Democrats don't want to
14:44
secure the Border reelect me so in a
Why Trump is trying to torpedo it
14:47
very real sense Trump is trying to
14:48
torpedo this we suspect because he wants
14:51
to make sure that a huge issue so
14:55
animating and Central to his campaign
14:56
and his base remains an issue that's
14:59
animating to his campaign and to his
15:02
base if he lets this deal happen he can
15:05
no longer run against a Joe Biden who
15:08
hasn't done something about the Border
15:12
exactly and he and his supporters are
15:14
very committed to keeping that tool
15:17
alive for the next several months but
How meaningful is Trumps message
15:19
help me understand the power of what
15:20
Trump is up to here because at this
15:22
moment yes he's Donald Trump a very
15:25
influential leader within the Republican
15:26
party but he's not involved in the
15:28
negotiation
15:29
he's not president he might not win and
15:32
become president so just how meaningful
15:36
is his message to these House
15:39
Republicans it's extremely meaningful
15:41
because it's not like Donald Trump is on
15:43
an island thinking this way by weighing
15:45
in here he's exploiting a divide that
15:47
was always there in the GOP you had the
15:50
right wing of the party very very
15:53
skeptical because they want to do more
15:55
and then you had a part of the party
15:57
that was saying hey Let's Make a Deal so
16:00
Trump coming in and Catering to the base
16:02
on this is kind of exactly what Trump
16:04
always does and once he does exploit
16:07
that Gap it not only reinforces the
16:11
anti- deal sentiment that was already
16:12
there in the house it starts to turn
16:15
Senators cold on the idea of a deal too
16:18
and it trickles all the way up to Senate
16:20
minority leader Mitch McConnell who
16:23
tells a room full of Republicans as the
16:26
deal is getting very very close to being
16:27
done look we're in a quandry here we are
16:31
potentially voting against the person
16:34
who's going to be the GOP nominee and so
16:36
we have to decide are we gon to vote
16:39
with what Trump wants or against it and
McConnell reveals the answer
16:42
judging by the fact that McConnell said
16:44
this to a room full of Republican
16:46
Senators I suspect he is in doing so
16:49
revealing the answer right that you
16:53
really can't vote against the party's
16:55
nominee yeah he is admitting to the
16:57
reality that they're in which is that
16:59
you can't do this without there being
17:01
HEC toay on the campaign Trail and that
17:04
could blow back on a lot of his members
17:06
if they decide no we're going to put our
17:08
heads down and plow through with this
17:10
and it's around this point where
17:11
McConnell shows he's wavering he's
17:14
willing to be swayed and not lead his
17:16
party through this that Johnson jumps
17:18
back in and says this is Dead on Arrival
17:21
if it comes to the house which in a way
17:24
creates even more pressure on Senate
17:26
Republicans who start saying look if
17:28
this doesn't have a future why should we
17:30
stick our necks out for this deal so is
Johnson jumps back in
17:33
it correct to say that that is the
17:35
moment when this almost major bipartisan
17:40
deal basically collapses I think the
17:44
next few days are going to tell whether
17:45
Trump has successfully torpedoed it or
17:48
whether there's going to be a Schism in
17:50
the GOP because some Senators decide not
17:53
to let him completely torpedo it but
17:55
yeah ultimately speaking the fate of
17:58
this bill is slim to none in Congress
18:01
because Trump has reinforced The house's
18:04
inclinations and that has created back
18:07
pressure on Senate Republicans to just
18:08
say nah not now not good enough not this
18:14
[Music]
Bidens reaction
18:19
year what is the reaction from President
18:21
Biden to this turn of events into the
18:23
kind of Rapid deterioration of this
18:26
deal so president does something kind of
18:29
interesting two months ago my team
18:32
beginning to work with a bpru group of
18:34
senators to put together the toughest
18:36
smartest fairest border security bill in
18:38
history he starts talking really tough
18:41
about the border and saying that bill
18:44
with the law today I'd shut down the
18:46
border right now and fix it quickly give
18:48
me this deal if you give it to me I will
18:50
shut down the Border it is the sort of
18:53
talk that you'd expect to hear frankly
18:56
from a big border enforcement guy is not
19:00
how President Biden started off his term
19:02
he's the guy who campaigned on AE
19:04
approach to immigration and now he's
19:06
saying I'll shut it all down huh and so
19:08
in a way it's like he's trying to enter
19:11
the ring that Trump is already in and
19:14
basically outflex him on how tough he
19:16
can talk about the border so at this
What happens now
19:18
point what happens to the two very
19:21
substantive questions at the center of
19:24
this bill and this compromise what
19:27
happens to funding for Ukraine and what
19:30
happens to this effort to secure the
19:33
Border if this bill now seems to be
19:34
going absolutely nowhere that is the big
19:37
question right because when this all
19:39
started Republicans set this quid proquo
19:43
of no Ukraine Aid without the Border
19:45
deal if they don't accept the Border
19:47
deal that the bipartisan team of
19:48
negotiators came up with either they've
19:51
got to reneg on that position that got
19:53
this ball rolling in the first place to
19:55
make sure that more Ukraine Aid can get
19:56
out the door or they just got to say
19:58
yeah we're comfortable with that we're
20:00
comfortable with the fact that the
20:01
United States is going to pull back on
20:03
support that maybe the rest of the
20:04
western world will follow and that that
20:06
means Russia could overwhelm Ukraine on
20:08
the battlefield for Democrats there's
20:12
very little incentive to give the
20:13
Republicans any of these border
20:15
enforcement measures without securing
20:17
that Ukraine Aid that was the whole
20:18
reason that they agreed to go into this
20:20
negotiation in the first place and the
20:23
result of that is basically going to be
20:25
you know maintenance of the status quo
20:27
which is is a little bit Bleak given the
20:29
fact that leaders of both parties have
20:31
acknowledged the situation on the border
20:32
is not tenable and something has to be
20:34
done about it it feels like at the end
Bleak
20:36
of the day this is really the story of a
20:39
Democratic president being willing to
20:42
meet his Republican Congressional peers
20:45
much more than halfway on a very
20:47
sensitive issue the border and
20:49
immigration and the response from those
20:52
Congressional Republican peers is to
20:56
reject the offer not it seems
21:00
fundamentally because of the policies at
21:02
hand but because of the politics at hand
21:05
because Donald Trump told them he
21:07
doesn't like the deal and they said well
21:10
if you don't like it we don't like it so
21:13
what does that ultimately tell us I
What Republicans Want
21:15
think it tells us that what Republicans
21:18
want here is either a entirely
21:23
Republican solution that looks like a
21:25
resumption of the policies that
21:28
president Trump implemented on the
21:30
border which is a big ask when you only
21:32
control the House of Representatives and
21:34
Democrats control the Senate and the
21:36
White
21:36
House or they want to be able to
21:40
preserve the ability to blame the Biden
21:43
Administration we've talked about how
21:46
that's likely to play out and already is
21:48
playing out on the presidential election
21:50
circuit it's also playing out within the
21:53
House of Representatives which is
21:54
currently trying to impeach Alejandra
21:57
mayorcas the Homeland Security secretary
22:00
effectively for failing to shut down the
22:01
Border in what frankly a lot of
22:04
conservative legal Scholars are also
22:06
calling not a good impeachment something
22:09
that does not actually rise the level of
22:11
that sort of indictment and punitive
22:13
action but that's what they're choosing
22:15
to do and that is very much a sticking
22:17
your finger pointing it at the Biden
22:19
Administration and saying this is your
22:21
fault and we want you guys to take the
22:23
personal hit for this and we want to
22:25
prioritize that over any sort of you
22:28
know down payment on trying to make
22:32
these policy fixes that maybe we could
22:34
build on if we had a Republican
22:35
president next and that seems to be the
22:39
prevailing winds in the GOP and that
prevailing winds in the GOP
22:41
wind is no deals even if the deal is on
22:44
something that the Republicans say they
22:45
care about and want because they would
22:47
rather be able to blame the Democrats
22:52
yeah unless they get everything that
22:55
they want or practically everything that
22:56
they want Main maintaining that ability
22:59
to say it's your fault is worth more and
23:03
that's just a reality of the political
23:05
time that we're in but it's also just a
23:07
reality of
23:09
how messily divided things are in
23:11
Congress and how impossibly hard it can
23:14
be to start a middle
23:26
way
23:28
well Karen thank you very much we
23:30
appreciate it thank you so

senators grill tech executives
23:49
back here's what else you need to Day
23:53
online child sexual exploitation is a
23:55
crisis in America during a high-profile
23:59
hearing on Wednesday senators from both
24:01
parties interrogated the country's most
24:04
powerful Tech Executives about why their
24:07

24:14

24:31
choices get resources or see results
24:36
anyway Mr Zuckerberg what the hell were
24:39
you
24:40
thinking all right Senator um the the
24:43
the basic science behind that the
24:45
leaders of meta Tik Tok snap Discord and
24:49
X testified that they have taken steps
24:52
to crack down on such material but when
24:55
pressed most of the ex Ives refuse to
24:59
endorse Federal Regulation to address
25:02
the problem are you familiar with the
25:04
earned act do you support that like yes

25:08
support it today but we believe you
25:10
support the seesam ACT um the stop cesam
25:13
act um we are not prepared to support
25:15
