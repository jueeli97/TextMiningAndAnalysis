The U.N. Scandal Threatening Crucial Aid to Gaza



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina tavernes and this is the [Music]
0:09
daily we turn now to Israel where a growing list of countries around the world have suspended funding to a un
0:17
Refugee Agency for Palestinians Israel has now shared its intelligence claiming
0:22
at least 13 un Aid workers actually took part in the Hamas attack on Israel on
0:27
October 7th late last month an explosive allegation that workers from a crucial
0:33
un relief agency in Gaza had taken part in the October 7th attacks stunned the
0:39
world and prompted major donors including the US to suspend funding
0:44
today Jerusalem bureau chief Patrick Kingsley on what this could mean for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and how it
0:52
might complicate Israel's strategy in the
0:58
war [Music]
1:04
it's Tuesday February [Music]
1:13
6th Patrick hi hi Sabrina so the last time we talked late last year there was
1:20
this growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza most of the population had been displaced disease and hunger were
1:27
starting to emerge as bigger and bigger problems now the situation has gotten worse and
1:33
in the midst of all of this the main un relief agency in Gaza known as unra has
1:39
been engulfed in Scandal over accusations that some of its staff actually played a role in the October
1:45
7th attack yes so tell me the story and what we know what we know is this on
1:52
January 18th the head of amra Philip gazarini went to what was expected to be
1:57
a routine meeting with a senior Israeli Diplomat to discuss delivery of Aid and
2:03
fuel to Gaza the supplies that umra helps to coordinate instead the Israeli Diplomat
2:10
dropped a bombshell accusation he claimed that roughly a dozen employees
2:16
of Umbra had either participated in the Hamas Le raid on Israel on October 7th
2:23
or in one case in its aftermath wow so that is quite a bombshell it's a very
2:29
serious ation this is just a small tiny minority
2:35
of the 13,000 employees of amra in Gaza but nevertheless it's too many and
2:41
certainly not what you expect of a UN agency that is devoted to neutrality and
2:48
humanitarianism right so actually tell us what this agency does in Gaza amra is the main a Organization for Palestinians
2:56
that is run by the United Nations in in times outside War it provides education
3:02
and Primary Health Care for roughly 5 million Palestinians across the Middle
3:08
East including more than a million in Gaza itself it runs hundreds of schools
3:15
and provides education for roughly 300,000 gazen children since the war has
3:22
begun it has being the primary supply of shelter to displace Palestinians more
3:29
than half the population is now living in an umra facility its schools and
3:35
other facilities have provided a roof over the head of some 1.2 million gens
3:42
since the start of the war a crucial organization especially in this moment yes absolutely and after that meeting
3:50
with the senior Israeli Diplomat lazarini the head of amra begins to fire
3:55
nine of the employees who are accused of participating in the attack two of them we believe are already dead and at least
4:02
one of them in the attack itself then the UN starts to tell the donor states
4:08
that provide umu with most of its funding Chief among them the United States and that led to senior American
4:16
diplomats being briefed on the claims and they were presented by Israeli officials with a dossier outlining these
4:27
claims on that same day umra decided to announce to the world that these
4:34
allegations have been made against some of their employees and that some of them had already been fired now the UN has
4:42
fired nine UNR remembers we understand two more are being looked into and that
4:48
news led the United States and then a Cascade of more than a dozen other
4:53
countries to suspend their funding for umra pending further investigation the
4:59
US has paused funding to the UN agency that is actually providing Aid to the Palestinians Canada announced it too has
5:05
temporarily paused any additional latest to hold Aid being Germany Japan and Austria became the latest countries to
5:11
suspend payments and this came on the same day hours after the un's top court
5:16
ordered Israel to take measures to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza that the international court of justice in
5:22
the Haag had ruled that in order to prevent genocide Israel needed to supply
5:28
more Aid to Gaza and so at a time when more Aid was supposed to be coming into
5:36
Gaza the un's biggest Aid agency was running the risk of collapse the head of
5:42
unra is calling for all those Nations who are suspending funding right now to
5:48
change their mind given the desperate flight of so many this would be a heavy blow if unr's operations were suspended
5:56
in some way and indeed we've been told by am's
6:04
leadership that if the funds aren't restored by the end of February it will
6:09
struggle to operate that could have grave implications for the distribution of Aid and the provision of shelter to
6:17
more than a million gazin just at the wrong time just as we're told that famine is looming in parts of Gaza more
6:25
than half the buildings in Gaza are damaged or destroyed according to un estimates and around 2
6:33
million people out of 2.2 million have been displaced so it couldn't be happening this convergence of events at
6:42
a worse time right an already bad situation is likely to get a lot worse for gsin yes exactly what were the
6:50
actual charges Patrick I mean what did you learn about that well to begin with it really wasn't clear what the specific
6:58
allegations were we had this statement from amra saying that there were claims
7:03
against various employees there was talk of a dosier but no one was releasing any
7:09
information so what me and our colleague ran Bergman did we spent the
7:16
weekend calling up as many sources as we could reach trying to find out exactly
7:22
what this Doss had said and two days after the allegations broke we finally
7:28
got our hands on the dossier itself and what it alleged was shocking it said
7:36
that for example one of the employees a teacher had been involved in a raid on
7:43
the Israeli Village of Bei where roughly 100 people were killed during the
7:48
October 7th attack it said another person was involved in the kidnapping of a woman it said that a third person was
7:57
involved in the capture of a solders corpse on October 7th and so on and so
8:04
on the list went on huh the dossier said the information was mainly taken from
8:11
wiretaps of people's phones and also through the geolocation of people's
8:17
phones on the day of October 7th we could only confirm the identity of one
8:23
of the people accused but we had no way of verifying the material ourselves all
8:29
we knew was that umra had decided themselves to take action both firing nine people and announcing the news
8:37
publicly H and that wasn't all the dossier also had another claim an even
8:45
bigger claim that had not previously been reported and that was that
8:51
according to the Israeli military roughly a tenth of umr's Staff of 13,000
8:59
in inside Gaza were Affiliated or members of Hamas and other militant
9:06
factions wow and this was an astonishing claim for an agency that is supposed to
9:12
be neutral supposed to be independent of political groups let alone armed groups
9:17
right and once again this was an impossible to verify claim and the
9:23
Israelis have not publicly produced any evidence to support it nevertheless they
9:29
say that this calculation is taken by cross referencing a list of umra Staff
9:35
members in Gaza with lists or or a list of Hamas members that the Israeli
9:43
military had taken during its invasion of Gaza from computers that they found
9:50
in Hamas bases inside the territory but Patrick what exactly does Israel mean
9:56
when it says 10% of the staff some, 1300 people were considered members of Hamas
10:02
like are we talking about militants or are we talking about government bureaucrats because of course Hamas is
10:08
the government of Gaza the claim was that roughly 200 of those 1300 were
10:17
involved in militant activities the rest of the 1300s so the vast majority were people involved in
10:25
the political movement or the social movement of Hamas remember that is not just an armed faction that fires rockets
10:32
at Israel or that attacked Israel on October 7th it's also a social movement that has deep roots in society and helps
10:40
to run a civilian government and there is quite a lot of overlap between its
10:47
membership and the general population of Gaza which is not to say that the
10:52
majority of gazin are affiliated with Hamas but just to say that in a way it's
10:57
not that surprising that any large institution in Gaza would have some level of overlap with a political
11:05
movement and a social movement as large as Hamas umra takes its staff
11:11
predominantly in Gaza from the population of Gaza the 13,000 umra staff
11:17
members are mostly not International Aid workers from other countries they come from the place that they are working in
11:25
Gaza and indeed if you go anywhere in the world any experienced Aid worker
11:30
will tell you that it's a constant challenge to maintain independence from any armed group or Rebel group be it in
11:38
South Sudan or Northern Sri Lanka and these are common challenges that affect
11:43
the aid sector orever they work all that said the UN is supposed to be a
11:48
politically neutral body and that's what gives the UN its gravitas and its power this is an institution that's meant to
11:55
be above politics above Division and it's not supposed to be compromised by any party to accomplish so its workers
12:03
should not be members of Hamas or any other Palestinian political armed group for that matter right if it's true this
12:11
claim would be hugely damning yes and once this information this 10% figure
12:16
was brought to the attention of The Wider World it cemented in the eyes of amra's critics the idea that something
12:23
was rotten within Umbra and that came as more countries
12:28
suspended their funding and it led a couple of days later and I think it's
12:34
time that the International Community and the UN itself understand that un's
12:39
mission has to end to Benjamin Netanyahu the Israeli Prime Minister breaking his
12:44
silence on the issue calling specifically for amous dissolution there are other agencies in the UN there are
12:51
other agencies in the world they have to replace onra what if anything has Hamas
12:57
said about this I mean do they confirm or deny that these folks are in fact
13:02
members of homas so I asked the Hass spokesman that question and didn't get a
13:07
clear answer what they have publicly said is that they condemn Umbra for
13:14
criticizing the actions of anyone who has participated in what they see as
13:20
legitimate resistance against Israel but what much of the world sees as acts of
13:26
brutal terrorism and they also criticize omra for firing some of its employees
13:32
based on material given to it by hamas's enemy Israel so Patrick this
13:38
relationship between unra and Hamas is very fraught unra is responsible for critical services in Gaza you know
13:44
social safety net for a big swath of the country and that's in normal times and has to navigate working side by side
13:52
with the government which is Hamas which is considered a terrorist group by the US and the EU and others and now in the
13:59
midst of the war unra is even more critical to the people of Gaza who were trying to survive the bombardments and
14:05
The Invasion following hamas's October 7th attack on Israel but unra is also
14:10
now facing the scrutiny for having staff associated with that attack so that's
14:15
all very complicated it's hugely complicated amra is independent of Hamas
14:22
it's got formerly nothing to do with the group but it nevertheless operates within a dictatorial regime in which
14:28
Hamas is the ruler and that forces it to work side by side with
14:35
Hamas and at the same time they also have to coordinate with the Israeli armed forces in order to ensure that Aid
14:42
and other supplies and also their own International employees can enter and exit Gaza so this has all been very
14:50
difficult to navigate for years during the 2021 war with Israel for example or
14:57
or just after it the the most senior umra official in Gaza made comments that were perceived to be favorable towards
15:04
Israel's military operations and there was such an outcry in Gaza and from Hamas because of that that this official
15:12
was withdrawn from amra but from the Israeli perspective this kind of tension
15:18
between umra and Hamas is a fig leaf that obscures a more symbiotic relationship in which umra is not fully
15:25
independent and operates in their view under Mass's influence omra denies that
15:31
completely and says that it's totally neutral but nevertheless the accusation has long being that omra works under the
15:38
influence of [Music] Hamas so in a way this latest incident
15:45
is just one in a long line of flash points between omra and Israel that goes back decades if for Palestinians omra is
15:53
an icon and something of a protector to many Israelis it's it's a consistent
15:59
problem and this latest incident simply confirmed perceptions that Israelis have long held about the
16:06
[Music]
16:12
group we'll be right [Music]
16:27
back so Patrick you said that many in Israel have long believed that unra is a consistent problem what do you mean by
16:34
that what I mean is they take issue with what they say that the agency
16:39
fundamentally stands for and that goes all the way back to the reasons why it
16:45
was founded in 1949 a year after Israel was
16:51
[Music] founded at that time you had roughly more than
16:57
700,000 pal refugees who had fled or been forced from their homes during the
17:03
wars that surrounded the creation of the state of Israel and to care for those refugees
17:10
who have been scattered all across the middle east in Lebanon in Jordan and in
17:16
Gaza the UN founded one of the first un agencies in its history it was called
17:22
the UN relief and works Agency for Palestine refugees or unra for
17:30
short and its job was to provide education and other services to those
17:38
refugees and for the 74 years since it
17:44
has basically acted implicitly if not directly to maintain the identity of
17:52
those Palestinian refugees and to in the Israeli View sustain the idea in those
18:00
refugees Minds that one day because they're refugees they might actually return to the place that they were
18:07
forced from and they might one day come back live in the homes that their families lived in in what became
18:14
[Music] Israel but to Israelis that is an
18:21
enormously threatening idea because if you had 5 million Palestinians returning
18:28
to Israel as these refugees and their descendants now number it would
18:34
completely dilute the Jewish character of the Jewish State and Israelis don't
18:39
want that to Israelis it's also threatening because the idea of 5 million people coming from territory
18:45
where Israel has fought many wars for decades with is a security threat it's
18:53
also a logistical threat how would it work if 5 million people or even a small
18:58
minority come to Israel and try to move into the villages where they once live
19:05
many of which were destroyed right then there's another perspective which more or less acknowledges all the criticisms
19:11
that Israel makes about the very character of the institution of umra but
19:17
in the Palestinian perspective this is a good thing while many people who are classified today as Palestinian refugees
19:23
were not alive in 1948 they nevertheless feel that it is their right to return to
19:30
land on which their ancestors lived on many years previously huh so in a sense
19:36
there's quite a lot of common ground between the Israeli and Palestinian perspective of omra one side just thinks
19:41
its existence is a bad thing and the other thinks it's a good thing so I guess I get how this agency could
19:48
symbolically represent a threat to Israel but in reality how much is this
19:54
Aid organization actually a threat to the state of Israel I mean how much are they actually working toward
20:01
Palestinians getting to return to what is now Israel well the claim is not that the leaders of omra are going around
20:08
directly mobilizing Palestinian refugees to return to Israel a lot of the debate
20:15
around omra centers on what is taught in its schools huh in Israel it has not
20:21
gone un noticed that of the Dozen people accused of participating in the October
20:27
7th attack several of them were either teachers or workers in those schools and the
20:34
curriculums in those schools have also come under tremendous Israeli scrutiny
20:40
in one case researchers highlighted how a textbook glorified a Palestinian
20:46
militant who was involved in a terror attack on Israeli civilians in the 1970s called Dalal mrai and in other cases
20:54
Israeli researchers have highlighted maps of Palestine published in textbooks used in amra schools that do not include
21:01
the state of Israel omra has in some cases
21:06
acknowledged these criticisms and has said it's taken action to withdraw those particular materials from circulation
21:13
and Palestinians for their part also make similar criticisms of the Israeli education system where you often see
21:19
maps of Israel that don't include the West Bank or Gaza or assume that the West Bank is part of the state of Israel
21:27
uh and Palestinians in general point out that the education system that is provided in um schools and in other
21:35
parts of the Palestinian education system is of a fairly good standard the
21:41
literacy rate among Palestinians is stands at 95% which is nearly 10 points higher
21:49
than the global average H the other major criticism that Israelis make about
21:57
umra is that it somehow turns a blind eye to hamas's militant activity that
22:03
Hamas or other militant groups have stored ammunition inside umra facilities
22:10
or have fired Rockets from very close to umra schools or even dug tunnels
22:17
underneath its buildings and umra says that when it finds out about this um it
22:22
takes action and has even publicized some of these transgressions itself and
22:28
and that ultimately it can't do much if people fire Rockets from close to its schools it's not an armed institution
22:34
and and has no means of combating that so for the critics of unra the idea is basically that unra is supporting the
22:41
Hamas agenda which is of course the destruction of Israel through propaganda and then looking the other way when
22:47
Hamas uses their facilities for war but unrest saying we don't have a military
22:52
to stop any of this stuff we're just trying to provide services the best we can in an extreme difficult environment
22:59
yes and that's why an allegation like the ones we've been hearing recent days have been so damaging because it
23:04
suggests that amra isn't just independent institution working within a difficult environment but that it has
23:11
been infiltrated by people who are members of the group that the UN is
23:17
saying it's independent from so I have to imagine that people who've been making these accusations all of these
23:22
years are feeling pretty satisfied that these allegations have come to light and are being seen by the world and taken
23:30
seriously by the world I think yes and no some people are delighted they saying
23:36
we've always said this and finally these ideas are getting Prime Time Others May
23:41
agree fundamentally that amra is this nefarious organization but they don't
23:46
feel this is the time to try and bring it down because as much as they dislike the premise of what omra stands for they
23:54
recognize that it plays a huge and important role in sustaining life ultimately during a devastating war that
24:01
has killed roughly one 100 gazans according to gazen official
24:07
estimates and they don't have a plan for what could replace umra and who could
24:12
step in who has the Manpower and the logistical footprint to deliver Aid to
24:18
provide shelter and there are fears that if umra collapses it would hugely worsen
24:23
what is already a very dire humanitarian situation right spoken to Israeli
24:29
officials and former officials and they see it as part of a lack of strategic
24:34
planning on the part of the Israeli government which is avoiding very
24:39
difficult questions about what Israel wants to see in Gaza after the war es
24:45
and for some of them it's also exactly the wrong thing to be doing at a time
24:52
when Israel stands accused of genocide and in particular when the world's
24:58
highest court the international court of justice in the ha has just ordered Israel to prevent genocide in part by
25:07
increasing more Aid to Gaza and on the same day that that order was made we
25:15
instead see a number of countries start pulling funding for the biggest Aid
25:22
operation in the Gaza Strip which raises questions about whether in fact will'll
25:28
see less Aid rather than more right obviously the question of Aid is most
25:33
critical to the ongoing struggle of gazin to simply survive this war but for
25:38
Israel the idea that the main Aid agency in Gaza would be hobbled and therefore
25:44
the humanitarian crisis there would get worse is both a practical problem but
25:49
also a problem for how the world sees Israel in this moment absolutely it's a perception problem for Israel but it's
25:56
also a perception problem for many of the Western countries including the United States who were the first to pull
26:03
funding for Umbra as this Scandal broke if Israel has a reputation problem as a
26:11
result of this war so too does the United States and the Biden administration because of its support
26:16
for Israel and its own reputation and perceptions of its intentions are also
26:24
wrapped up in Israel's fate and Gaza yeah it's a very tricky situation for
26:29
the Us and other funders on the one hand they don't want to be perceived as having anything to do with anyone who
26:37
has anything to do with Hamas on the other hand they also don't want to be seen as being responsible in any way for
26:45
this humanitarian crisis one that will get worse if the one real Aid
26:50
organization goes away exactly but we have seen attempts
26:55
by us officials to C this suspension In a Different Light we've seen stories come out saying that
27:03
actually the US was not due to send more funding for a while and that the last
27:09
remaining TR of the funding it was supposed to provide in this particular funding cycle was minimal and that in
27:16
essence the suspension was more of a symbolic move than one that would actually have practical effect on um's
27:24
uh budget so kind of trying to walk it back a bit exactly all that said while
27:30
the US is the main fun or the largest fun of amra the collective effect of all
27:36
the other suspensions from more than a dozen other countries could well be
27:41
damaging enough to leave umra in major trouble and according to umra it could
27:47
go out of business they say by the end of the month because there are so many other suspensions of funding from other
27:54
sources so actually men many in Israel you know the US and countries around the
28:01
world and and most of all gazin are aligned in having pretty serious
28:07
interest in UNR not collapsing right now exactly and the key words there are
28:13
right now while this war goes on certainly there is a strange and perhaps
28:19
surprising alignment of interests if not motives right in the long term of course
28:24
there remain profound disagreements not only about the future of amra but the future of Gaza and who should govern it
28:32
what role should Hamas play What role should Israel play What role should other Palestinian leaders play and of
28:38
course what role should amra play and should it play any role at
28:45
all Israel wants to see a completely different architecture of Aid agencies
28:51
and a distribution others think it's entirely the wrong time to be discussing
28:57
revamping the aid system in a territory where more than 80% of people are
29:02
displaced more than half the buildings are damaged or destroyed and one in 100
29:08
people has been [Music]

Sabrina the times reports that unra is set to lose at least $65 Million by the end of
