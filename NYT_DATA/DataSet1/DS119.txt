Trump’s Voters vs. Haley’s Donors


0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael babo this is the [Music]
0:12
daily inside the Republican Party a class war is playing out between the
0:18
prot Trump base who's ready for the nomination fight to be over and the anti-trump donor class who thinks it's
0:26
just getting started today my colleague aad hearnen a
0:34
political correspondent and host of the runup reports on that
0:39
[Music]
0:44
clash it's Tuesday January [Music]
0:54
30th hello hello hi hey how are you
1:01
good let me know when you're ready I'm ready okay so instead at this moment in
Trumps Voters vs Haleys Donors
1:08
the Republican presidential race two kind of baffling things are occurring at the same
1:14
time this race is far from over there are dozens of States left to go the
1:21
first is that former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is behaving as if
1:27
she really has a shot at beating Donald Trump we still have a ways to go but we
1:34
keep moving up which all evidence suggests is false
1:40
and the second thing that's happening is that Donald Trump and just a little note to Nikki she's not going to win is
1:48
fixated on attacking Nikki Haley and her campaign over and over I said wow she's
1:54
doing uh like a speech like she won she didn't win she lost and You know despite
2:01
the fact that she has no real shot at beating him spech but let's not have
2:06
somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night she had a very bad
2:12
night and you and you have been studying the Republican presidential race very
2:18
closely over the past few months so my question for you is why are both of these things happening and what do they
2:24
tell us about this political moment in the Republican party yeah I mean I think if you see it through the lens of just
2:30
Donald Trump versus Nikki Haley and two candidates that are vying to get the nomination then you're right it is kind
2:35
of baffling you know Haley has always been a Longshot to become the Republican nominee and that's even become more
2:40
clear as voters in Iowa and New Hampshire and particularly the Republican base has made it
2:46
overwhelmingly obvious that their preference is Donald Trump indeed but I think if you view it through a different
2:52
lens and specifically the kind of broader coalitions that these two candidates represent and the donors that
2:58
support these campaigns then I think you understand why they feel so diametrically opposed and why
3:05
the slices of the Republican Party who are supporting them see themselves as diametrically opposed so what I mean by
3:11
that is the more Nikki Haley stays in the race the more it fuels the distaste on the Trump Maga movement side
3:18
specifically because they see her as a candidate who represents the interest of a elite donor class of a moderate
3:25
Republican Wing that's more lenient on issues of immigration that is more differential to the foreign policy
3:31
establishment and embrace kind of American intervention and Wars abroad and those are such fundamental beliefs
3:38
when you think about the kind of Donald Trump wing of the Republican party that they see someone like Haley as being
3:43
offensive to the idea that that's what the Republican party in 2024 represent H
3:49
and when I was at Donald Trump's Victory party in Nashville New Hampshire last week when we see the results rolling in
3:55
that confirm another Victory it wasn't just that the supporters and the building were mocking Nikki Haley and
4:02
kind of gloating on the fact that they were winning they were also mocking what they called the elite donor Republican
4:10
class who they think is funding Nikki Haley so when we were watching the results on the screen on Tuesday first
4:16
off reintroduce yourself my name is John Fredericks I'm a TV and radio talk show host and more importantly the Godzilla
4:22
the truth I am the Godzilla of the truth I'm on in the morning IAL to a conservative radio host named John
4:28
Fredericks he's someone who has aligned himself with Donald Trump and really gives a good articulation of what the
4:33
Maga movement represents listen this is the greatest movement the populist movement of working people in the
4:41
history of the Republic and these donors on Wall Street don't get it they don't
4:47
understand the party has changed this is a workingclass party now white black
4:52
Asian Hispanic it doesn't matter if you work for a living and you are punching a clock and you're not part of the elite
4:59
right you're getting screwed and they know it your jobs are going away your wages are eroding your profit Shar is
5:06
going down your savings is getting obliterated with inflation you're getting wiped out they don't care
5:12
illegals are overrunning your country they're taking your jobs they're shipping into the China and the elites
5:17
and the donor class and the Wall Street gangster banksters who live for open borders and cheap labor just think they
5:24
can buy this stuff those are the type of messages that the Donald Trump wing of the Republican party is putting out
5:31
there about Nikki Haley kind of framing the efforts as a elite undemocratic idea
5:37
that they can talk over what the workingclass Republican person wants and of course what they're saying that
5:42
working-class Republican wants is Donald Trump but one of the things that he said that really sticks with me is that they
5:49
see the Maga movement as something that is independent from any individual candidate it's our movement right now
5:55
Donald Trump is the conduit for that post Trump there'll be someone else
6:00
because the populist movement is on the verge tonight of obliterating the
6:06
establishment un party Elite and we're weeks away from taking over the whole
6:12
Republican party apparatus if not weeks a year and so in supporting Donald Trump
6:18
they're not only doing that because they want him to be the individual candidate they're doing that because they see him
6:25
as a conduent to be able to root out that slice of the Republican Party the kind of donor class that supports Haley
6:31
which they find kind of detrimental to their overall interest right they want to reclaim the Republican party from
6:39
Rich donors and fully ensure that it's in the hands of the MAA movement which
6:45
in their minds is a workingclass movement kind of profoundly and inevitably at odds with a bunch of Rich
6:50
donors 100% and not just at odds with Rich donors odds with party leadership
6:55
at odds with the kind of Washington establishment they feel that they are distinct from the kind of political
7:01
institutions and apparatus that keep people in defined lines that they want to bust out of and so I think that's a
7:06
little bit of a different way to view the different candidacies I think Nikki Haley has supporters people who are
7:12
voting for her because of her stances on particular issues or because their desire to see them as the nominee Donald
7:18
Trump runs a group that thinks of themselves as a movement as more than just supporting a candidate but is a
7:25
vehicle to overtake the party itself but to the question of why why she's still
Why is Haley Still in the Race
7:30
in the race when all the signs point to that movement you're describing working
7:38
and defeating her what do you say I mean candidates drop out of races not because of their
7:44
own Val but mostly because they run out of money and they run out of support and the path to making them President right
7:50
and so I think that it is critical to understanding if you're asking why is Nikki Haley still in this race it's
7:57
because there are enough Republican donors who are willing to continue to support her to stay in this race right
8:03
and I think this is unique to this year partially because some people don't want to see the primary end so fast partially
8:09
because Donald Trump has legal issues hanging over his head and so there are some reasons in the air about like why
8:16
that support has continued but for the kind of trump wing of the party what they are saying is that the existence of
8:23
that support is a kind of anti-democratic perversion of the people's will h so thinking back to my
8:30
question about why is haly staying in the race why are Trump and his supporters kicking her around so hard
8:36
the answers are kind of interrelated and they're very much tied to what you just laid out which is the sense that donors
8:42
whose values and Visions are very much at odds with the MAA movement they're fueling the Haley movement Beyond its
8:49
expiration date according to Trump supporters and that is why Trump and his supporters are so mad at this campaign
8:56
exactly and I think it's important to not just view this in the vacuum of 20 24 but this is the entire premise of
9:02
Donald Trump's candidacy and his Ascension in the Republican Party he came in as the quote unquote Outsider as
9:08
a person who had his own individual money and was therefore unreliant to big donors there is a sense among his
9:14
supporters and a sense that he furthers in his own kind of rhetoric that he is the only candidate that is untethered to
9:22
the political institutions that serve the elites and that is not only donors but that is the political establishment
9:28
in Washington right like this is the message of Donald Trump right and so being at that event Nashville seeing the
9:33
open vitriol not only to the Haley campaign but to the Republican donors who are backing her made me think about
9:41
the kind of broader question of the party's Unity going
9:46
forward so the next morning after the results had come in I decided to call a
9:52
Haley donor a billionaire who was backing her to see how we saw the race going forward and how we would respond
9:59
to the argument that in giving so much money to a candidate who is such a long shot he is kind of seeking to upend the
10:07
will of the voters after the break a stead's
10:14
conversation with that
10:21
donor we'll be right
Interview with Tim Draper
10:27
back Hi estad how how are you I'm doing well how are you good Tim Draper is a
10:34
venture capitalist who's invested in companies like Tesla Skype Hotmail
10:39
twitch and Robin Hood I mean can you tell me a little bit about yourself can you tell me about like how tell me about
10:47
your your business career and how you made money in the first place yeah so I I started out as an
10:56
entrepreneur um oh let me go way back my grandfather was the first Silicon Valley
11:02
venture capitalist my father was a venture capitalist I had venture capital in my blood it was he's given more than
11:09
a million dollars to Haley's campaign and the outside groups that are backing her I guess I would start with just
11:15
saying like what caused you to back Nikki Haley and specifically what caused you to donate your money to Nikki
11:20
Haley yeah um I have been really impressed with her I think she has very
11:28
good character I think she is kind she is very
11:34
thoughtful she sees all points of view on U things like pro-choice versus
11:41
pro-life she understands U foreign policy which is I I travel a lot I go
11:48
all over the world and I've seen how important our foreign policy is and how
11:55
we're represented internationally and I like like her attitude of I I support my friends I
12:02
support democracies I don't support dictatorships uh when I first met her I
12:08
just thought wow this woman is um strong and capable and she gets things done and
12:15
you see that she does it in an effective way where everybody comes out feeling good and I think there's a a strong
12:24
character there and she's tough and she's willing to run for president I mean for somebody that amazing to be
12:32
willing to run for president I think we were just lucky you know one of the things that we've reported on through
12:38
this show is how Nikki Haley has a difficult path to win the Republican nomination partially because the ways
12:44
the party has changed in the Donald Trump era when you were giving to her when you are backing her originally I
12:50
guess I'm wondering kind of how were you thinking about her path to victory in the primary considering Donald Trump has
12:57
changed the party to such a degree you know what's funny I I I miscalculated on one thing and that was
13:05
that I didn't realize that those Trump supporters just
13:11
want retribution they're just angry and they want retribution and they stopped
13:17
listening and I was thinking oh my God a trump Biden combination it would be
13:24
ridiculous why we got so many great candidates out there why would we ever want these two octogenarians to be you
13:32
know our our two candidates you thought everyone was kind of on the same page that there you wouldn't want the same
13:37
thing again right I didn't think anybody really wanted that but I think that there is so much animosity built up and
13:47
I don't know which side is right here I don't have a a really strong feeling
13:53
about you know whether you know the people who are saying he was wronged or
13:58
the people who are saying he's a felon or right I don't know that'll come out in the courts or whatever but I I did
14:05
think you know he might have been a good candidate eight years ago and I'm not so sure that makes any sense today but his
14:14
supporters are just so much after retribution that I think they stopped listening yeah I mean that's kind of
14:21
where I wanted to go I mean obviously there were high hopes for Nikki Haley in New Hampshire specifically because it
14:26
has so much more of the independent votes the kind of Republican voter I think about the results last night as
14:32
I'm sure you watched would you say like is an 11-point loss there an example of her gaining traction or should we take
14:39
the results from Iowa and New Hampshire as evidence that the majority of the Republican base is squarely behind
14:44
Donald Trump no I think um you know she had 2% of the vote when I started backing her
14:51
and she is now at 43% of the vote uh she had 20% in Iowa
14:58
the the trend is good he still pulls better than she does but I think that
15:04
that is changing and now is the time to support her so she gets into the general
15:10
election so I so what I hear you're saying the trend line is such that you still feel good about that investment in
15:17
the Haley campaign and will you get more money going forward should she stay in this race I know that's an open question
15:23
that some people are trying to pressure her to get out what's your message to that no no a lot Happ happens in
15:29
politics and she's down to just the two of them she should definitely stay in a
15:34
lot can happen through you know South Carolina super Tuesday so no I I think
15:42
she should go go go I I'm very happy with the investment I made and I wrote a
15:47
song for her I mean I was GNA go to the song next so I'm glad you brought this
15:53
up because I recently heard the song It's a real earworm I I listened to it
15:58
yesterday and I have to say I did wake up today with you know we need you Nikki right now still stuck in
16:04
my I was going to ask can I hear some of the raap can you drop a little for us right
16:09
now no I'm not sure I can because I don't I don't have it all in my I know it sticks in your ear we need you Nikki
16:18
right now to lead our nation we
16:26
go need the we need you
16:32
n right now to lead our nation we need
16:38
you Nikki No Doubt with the conversation
16:45
we and then it's um oh I can tell you this part of the r
16:51
it's Trump the bully who's afraid of a fight against 5 in heels with twice
17:00
and Biden who's dying to drain our reserves when voters come out he'll get
17:06
his deserves we need you right now I mean that's a different
17:13
level of dedication to a candidate than we typically see right I guess I'm asking like considering the high road
17:19
she has to climb to become the nominee what made you say this moment right now
17:24
is all in is that the candidate or is that the political moment at Large it's the candidate um I think it's Nikki
17:33
Haley uh and we tend to get the candidate we need at the at the time we
17:38
need it in America Nikki Haley gets it one of the things that stuck out to me at the Trump Victory party last night is
17:46
that they're not just mocking or kind of demeaning Nikki Haley which there was a lot of there was a lot of mocking and
17:52
demeaning of the kind of donor class too they would say pretty openly that uh the
17:58
reason she's going to stay in this race is because people who are rich Republicans are going to fund her money
18:05
and what they're trying to do is speak over the will of the voter who have made clear the kind of workingclass
18:10
Republican voter wants to back Trump I guess I wanted to hear you respond to that idea what do you say to the idea
18:19
that what the donor class is trying to do in terms of keeping Nikki Haley afloat is against the will of the base
18:26
Republican voter well I'm rich but uh but a lot of the donors are not
Haleys Donors
18:34
you know what they're getting it it's interesting in the Haley campaign they're getting a lot of small donations
18:40
from women and they're getting donations from Democrats that was those aren't
18:46
Republicans you know like that's not the base of the Republican party is that problem well the I mean it depends on
18:52
what you mean by a Bas I think Trump just has a lot of people who they're
18:57
just thinking of hey he needs retribution and they're saying I'm not
19:04
thinking about anything else and I hope that they open their minds
19:10
and I hope that they uh start looking at it in a new way but I I can't see that
19:18
happening overnight kind my last question is to look ahead I know you're hosting a
19:24
fundraiser for Nikki Haley soon I guess I'm ask I guess two you're hosting two
19:29
okay yeah I guess a question I have is like what are the markers of that you're looking for for the campaign to continue
19:35
the upward trajectory that I think we both know it needs and then a follow-up
19:40
question I have is this if it does end up being Biden versus Trump again do you
19:46
know what you would do would you donate would you vote Trump would you do you
19:51
know um um I don't think that's going to
20:00
happen um and uh I think Nikki Haley
20:05
will be the president if it were in that situation I
20:10
would kind of Desperately look for a third party uh and I think a lot of people
20:16
would too I I think this is going to be an a very interesting couple of months here a
20:23
lot of things happen in politics and I think a lot of things will happen
20:28
so I hear the first step being look to South Carolina in super Tuesday invest more to try to give Haley the bump that
20:35
she needs and continue to close that Gap with Trump and then maybe a secondary step of this this does get to a thing
20:41
that you don't want being a rematch of 20120 would you invest money in a third
20:46
or you'll just deal with that well we might have to follow up in a couple months I don't
20:52
know the um thing that went off in my head was a what do you call it a
20:58
[Music] fight or run yeah yeah the fight or flight fight
21:05
oright say it would it would some instinctual nature would kick in I don't
21:11
know I don't know which way I'm gonna go I'm going to either fight this thing out or I'm going to [Music]
21:27
run
Drapers Denial
21:33
I said ultimately what do you make of this donor of Draper is he in denial
21:40
about the state of this race and the reality of the Republican Party In This Moment and how
21:47
representative is he of donors to Haley in both senses yeah I mean when I talk
21:55
to him I definitely hear a person who who is disconnected from the Republican base right to say the least in Draper's
22:03
defense a lot of people are you know his presumption that the Republican base
22:08
would not come back to Donald Trump considering all the things that have happened in the last couple years was a widespread belief right that was not
22:15
just true among a donor class I think that was true among a lot of people who have underrated the consistency and
22:24
cohesion of the Maga movement so I would say if he is in delusion it's a delusion
22:31
that's shared by a lot of people well looking back why was there so much delusion given the steamroller that
22:37
Trump has always been within the Republican Party well I mean I think certainly post midterms there was a
22:44
overly presumptuous idea among the party establishment that Donald Trump's
22:50
electoral losses would start to weigh on the base and that some people would look
22:56
for other options because of it and one thing I think was the biggest part of
23:03
the shared delusion was the secondary presumption that his indictments would
23:09
hurt him right that the candidates themselves did not have to make Donald Trump unpalatable because the legal
23:16
cases would do the work for them which as we know was entirely not not only wrong the opposite of the truth right
23:23
like it made more popular popular and so after midterms normal political logic
23:31
would tell you that the Electoral results the legal cases would inherently
23:36
add up to a universe where Donald Trump could not be the Republican nominee again and particularly not at this kind
23:42
of wide of a margin or Clarity of R and that was a presumption that was
23:48
made without the Republican base input you know right but this is why I keep
23:55
going back to movement politics is because that's the answer to why those rules don't really apply here is because
24:02
they are not thinking in the traditional political calculus and they'll tell you that they
24:09
simply tell you that all the time I just think it's an unwillingness to believe them so the Drapers of the world are not
24:18
just trying to make Nikki Haley happen they are trying to undo reality right
24:24
and when we think about Haley's donors all of them I mean how representative is
24:29
Draper and his view of the situation basically that if Haley loses he's out
24:36
of the Republican party to the question of like how representative is he the larger donor class I think we've gotten
24:42
some answers to that in the last couple days since the New Hampshire primary big donors like Reed Hoffman the founder of
24:48
Home Depot who's a big mover and Shaker in Republican politics announced that he was going to take a pause on supporting
24:55
Nikki Haley because he sees a hard time seeing the path forward at the same time there's clearly enough donors still
25:01
supporting her that the Trump campaign is taking it very seriously Trump announced that he would try to Blacklist
25:06
donors who would continue to support Nikki Haley a clear attempt to pressure people to kind of abandon her and make
25:12
the party rally around him as the presumptive nominee but the thing that I think is important is when you talk to
25:18
the Trump movement they say they don't care either way they have multiple goals and the biggest goal is to return Donald
25:25
Trump to the White House so even losing the general election is obviously not
25:31
what they want certainly the MAA capture of Republicans has given them problems with Independence and they would need a
25:38
Nicki Haley base if they want to unite the Republican party to go against Joe Biden right but a subset goal a thing
25:45
that John Frederick says very explicitly is to own the Republican party that's why it's important to see it not as a
25:51
traditional political campaign that operates in tactics but to see it as a movement that operates in ideals right
25:57
because mhm the most important thing is to run a campaign that's based on those
26:03
ideals and they basically think they'll get with us or they'll get lost there's an understanding it sounds like you're
26:08
saying that this effort to obliterate the Haley style donor class and the
26:16
establishment of the party it might mean they lose the election they understand that Haley has not just donors but lots
26:22
of supporters who they may not win over and because it's a movement what you're suggesting is they may be able to live
26:29
with that yes but remember they already asked Nikki Haley on the stage would she
26:35
support Donald Trump in the general election and she's already raised her hand the majority of Republicans are
26:40
going to vote for Donald Trump no matter how much he mocks no matter how much he demeans
26:46
right you know Democrats work from a premise of appeasing a kind of liberal Dem moderate group and expecting
26:52
progressives to come along and the Republican base has basically appeased their most conservative sect and think
26:59
that middle will come along and we'll find out if they're right
27:07
yeah I think the specific thing this year is considering the staleness of the
27:13
candidates does that lead people to drop off all together does that lead people to vote third party how does that fall I
27:19
don't think we know the answer to that H wellstead thank you very much thank you
27:25
for having me [Music]
27:36
we'll be right
