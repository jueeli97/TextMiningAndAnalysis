A Salacious Conspiracy or Just 34 Pieces of Paper?



0:03
it's 6:21 a.m. on
0:06
Monday I'm walking past City
0:08
Hall
0:11
Downtown just a couple blocks away from
0:13
the courthouse where openings are going
0:15
to begin today
0:16
and Trump's
0:20
trial one thing that's really striking
0:22
to me about today is that we've all
0:25
known the story that's about to be told
0:28
for a long time now
0:31
and I can tell you it gets a little
0:33
dull writing the words stemming from a
0:36
hush money payment to a porn star in
0:38
each story stemming from a hush money
0:40
payment to a porn
0:42
star but now it's really happening this
0:45
is a case a criminal case against Donald
0:49
Trump and today it's going to be
0:51
presented to a
0:54
jury it's gone from
0:56
story to reality
0:59
[Music]
1:03
from New York Times I'm Michael babbaro
1:06
this is the
1:08
daily today the prosecution and the
1:12
defense lay out their case in the first
1:16
criminal trial of Donald
1:19
Trump we turn once again to my colleague
1:23
Jonah Bromwich who watched from inside
1:27
the
1:28
courtroom it's it's Tuesday April
1:33
[Music]
1:36
23rd oh hello you're wearing a uh
1:40
courtroom tie that's right first step
1:42
very handsome thank you okay you ready
1:45
I'm ready okay well Jonah welcome back
1:49
thank you I want to start with kind of
1:52
credit where credit is due you last week
1:54
when you came and spoke about jury
1:57
selection in this trial predicted
2:00
Against All Odds that it would take a
2:04
single week which I was pretty skeptical
2:06
of you were right and I wonder if you
2:08
can
2:09
just I mean you know sometimes we get it
2:12
right sometimes we get it wrong when you
2:13
get it right you get some points just
2:15
describe the final jury that we ended up
2:18
getting given as you had told us the
2:20
huge importance of the jury to this case
2:23
sure so five of them are women seven of
2:25
them are men they are from all over
2:27
Manhattan as we knew would happen we
2:30
also know that this is a really Highly
2:31
Educated group we've got a lot of
2:32
advanced degrees we've got people who
2:35
work in technology in business in the
2:37
law very stereotypical white collar
2:39
professions MH and you'll remember when
2:41
we talked last that we were talking
2:43
about how being an interesting juror is
2:45
a little bit of a downside if you want
2:47
to get picked because if you're
2:48
interesting you probably posted
2:49
something on Twitter or Facebook that
2:50
meant that you weren't going to get on a
2:52
jury yeah that's exactly right and
2:53
that's what we saw happen is that the
2:56
defense picked up on people who had old
2:57
posts attacking Trump and they got them
3:00
dismissed in any way possible Right but
3:02
that doesn't mean that jurors on this
3:04
panel that we have seated don't have
3:06
strong opinions about trump it just
3:08
means we don't know so right we got the
3:10
uninteresting people now on this jury
3:13
and so in a sense their views are far
3:16
more of a black box than the jurors who
3:18
were dismissed black box is exactly
3:20
right it feels like the speed with which
3:23
this jury selection
3:25
happened tells us something about the
3:27
personality of the judge in this case is
3:29
that right exactly right and I think
3:31
it's a really key Point here so the
3:33
judge is named Juan Maran he's 61 years
3:36
old he has presided over several trials
3:40
involving Trump or his associates most
3:43
prominently the trial of the Trump
3:45
organization Trump's company in 2022 in
3:48
which the company was convicted of a
3:49
crime Maran knows that Trump's favored
3:53
tactic is delay he's dealt with it
3:55
before and he almost seems to be
3:57
countering that by speeding the along as
4:00
much as he can so we saw that last week
4:02
as he swore in groups of jurors Whenever
4:05
there was a free moment it seemed like
4:07
and we saw it today too how do we see it
4:09
today today we thought we were only
4:11
going to go until 2 p.m. because of the
4:13
Passover holiday but early in the
4:16
morning the judge gets onto the bench
4:18
and he says actually a juror has a
4:20
dentist appointment so we need to stop
4:22
even earlier we need to stop at 12:30
4:25
and those of us in the Press look around
4:26
and we say oh well we'll be lucky to get
4:29
even through opening statements today
4:31
not only did we get through opening
4:32
statements prosecution and defense but
4:35
we also got our first witness today
4:36
David pecker so I want to start with the
4:39
first thing that happened which is the
4:41
opening arguments from the prosecution
4:43
from in this case the District
4:44
Attorney's office in Manhattan tell us
4:47
about that starting with opening
4:48
arguments means starting with a guy
4:50
named Matthew Colangelo and we haven't
4:52
seen him that much yet during jury
4:54
selection he's been pretty quiet overall
4:57
and remember listeners are not going to
4:59
be able to hear from him at all because
5:00
there's no recording in the courtroom so
5:02
we're just going to have to kind of
5:03
retell you what he said and quote him as
5:05
much as possible and luckily you're very
5:07
good at that thank you but he stands up
5:09
he walks to the podium and he begins to
5:12
explain to the jurors in very clear
5:14
precise language what they will see
5:16
during trial MH and what he describes is
5:19
this fascinating tale of political
5:22
conspiracy he says that Trump met with
5:25
his former fixer Michael Cohen and David
5:27
pecker former publisher of the Inquirer
5:30
and the three came to an agreement a
5:33
conspiratorial agreement Colangelo says
5:36
to promote positive stories about Trump
5:38
and more importantly suppress negative
5:41
ones and so then Colangelo begins to
5:43
talk about some of those stories such as
5:45
what so there are three stories at issue
5:48
here the first is from a former doorman
5:51
at a trump org building who was seeking
5:53
to sell a story of trump allegedly
5:56
fathering a child out of wedlock which
5:58
turns out not to be true yes that one is
6:00
not true but nonetheless the national
6:02
Inquirer to use a phrase that people
6:04
have been familiar with for a while now
6:06
they caught and they killed that story
6:08
mhm they took that story which was
6:10
available for sale and they made sure
6:13
that no one would hear about it by which
6:15
we mean they paid somebody to give them
6:19
the story that they then never ran
6:22
that's exactly right the second of these
6:24
transactions involves a woman named
6:26
Karen McDougall and she was selling a
6:29
story of an affair with Trump so again
6:32
the national Inquirer stepped in they
6:34
bought the story the story never saw the
6:36
light of day and then finally Colangelo
6:40
describes something that's become very
6:41
familiar to us which is the hush money
6:43
payment to Stormy Daniels who also had a
6:45
story to sell about having had sex with
6:48
Trump but in this case there's a wrinkle
6:51
the national inquir had an awful lot of
6:53
trouble getting paid back for the Karen
6:56
McDougall payment paid back by paid back
6:59
by theum TR Camp ah they expected the
7:01
Trump Camp to basically reimburse them
7:04
for the catch and kill that's right so
7:07
when they had trouble getting paid it
7:09
increased their reluctance to get
7:10
involved in yet another one of these
7:12
catch and kill stories and so when
7:14
Stormy Daniels comes through with her
7:16
story of having had sex with Trump
7:18
Michael Cohen himself Trump's fixer
7:21
ultimately after Heming and Hauling a
7:23
bit goes and pays her himself and then
7:26
importantly Trump pays him back from the
7:28
White House and prosecutors say that
7:31
Trump disguises those payments there's
7:33
34 records of payments and instead of
7:35
saying these are payments for a hush
7:37
money to Stormy Daniels they say Legal
7:41
Services these were for Legal Services
7:43
because we have Michael Cohen he's a
7:44
lawyer he's working for Trump and that's
7:46
what he's getting paid for okay well
7:48
what is the point of the prosecutor here
7:52
laying out this conspiracy between Trump
7:57
the guy from the national Inquirer and
7:59
Trump's fixer Michael Cohen what's the
8:01
kind of larger Legal Foundation he's
8:04
building I would say there's two things
8:05
he's doing that are really really
8:07
important the first is this is
8:08
scintillating it's payoffs it's politics
8:11
it's porn starts it's everything that
8:13
makes this case as dazzling and
8:15
interesting as you could possibly
8:17
imagine and we see the jurors are taking
8:19
notes kind of frantic notes on what he's
8:21
saying interesting but legally speaking
8:23
what's important here is that you'll
8:25
remember that Trump is charged with
8:27
falsifying business records
8:30
not any of the stuff that we've just
8:31
been talking about right and the reason
8:34
that the conspiracy that Colangelo is
8:35
talking about is important is because
8:37
falsifying business records is only a
8:39
felony if it was undertaken to help
8:42
commit or conceal another crime the
8:44
prosecutors here are focused on
8:46
concealing a crime and for months and
8:49
months we've been asking well what crime
8:52
was concealed here today we get our
8:54
specific answer what Matthew Colangelo
8:57
says in his opening statement is that
9:00
they falsified business records to
9:02
conceal the crime of entering a
9:05
conspiracy to promote an election and
9:08
that the people who entered that
9:09
conspiracy were Trump Cohen and David
9:12
pecker I just want to recap this because
9:14
it's a little bit complicated what we
9:15
learn from the opening statement here
9:17
from the prosecution is that the way
9:20
that falsifying business records which
9:21
is what Trump is accused of becomes a
9:23
felony is if it's used to conceal a
9:28
different alleged crime that alleged
9:31
crime is an election crime and what the
9:34
prosecutor is saying here is that all
9:36
those conspiracies you just described
9:38
that is evidence of this second crime
9:41
that's how you get to felony charges
9:45
that's how you get to the very fact of
9:46
this trial that's right this crime is
9:48
like Fusion right falsifying business
9:50
records fuses with something else now we
9:53
see that that something else seems to be
9:55
this state election crime conspiracy to
9:57
promote election so Fusion of conspiracy
10:00
to promote election and falsifying
10:01
business records before we move on I
10:03
want to ask you potentially a slightly
10:05
annoying question you mentioned that the
10:07
second concealed crime here might be a
10:11
violation of a state law surrounding the
10:14
promotion of an election how do you
10:17
violate that law and do the prosecutors
10:19
say how Trump violated it so this is
10:22
what's so interesting about what
10:23
prosecutors did today they don't
10:25
actually have to prove it why they've
10:28
gotten to the stage of their case where
10:30
it's just baked into the charges they
10:32
are felony charges and so all they have
10:34
to do to win is to convince the jury
10:37
that their story makes sense and that
10:39
Trump falsified business records and so
10:41
on the front end if they show you that
10:43
he was trying to win the election by
10:46
suppressing these stories then on the
10:48
back end once they show you the records
10:50
being disguised they say that the jury
10:52
will be persuaded of why they said he
10:55
did it okay now that that complicated
10:57
legal business is squared away what else
10:58
should we know about
10:59
the prosecutor's opening statement
11:01
Colangelo then just walks the jurors
11:04
through each witness they're going to
11:05
hear from and how it builds back into
11:08
the case they're trying to make got it
11:10
one of those Witnesses is Michael Cohen
11:12
of course who was a prominent member of
11:14
what prosecutors said was a conspiracy
11:16
and one of the things that Colangelo
11:18
does is he kind of cleans up for the
11:23
prosecution what Cohen is going to be
11:25
like what do you mean he says that you
11:27
can expect that the defense lawyers will
11:29
say Cohen is not credible and that he
11:32
can't be trusted because he's this guy
11:35
who's been convicted of federal crimes
11:37
which is true who's changed his story
11:39
many many times and what Colangelo says
11:43
is look this is a guy who worked with
11:46
Trump and his story makes sense when as
11:49
a whole you look at how Trump operated
11:53
he needed someone like this to go around
11:56
and fix his problems and so Cohen is in
11:58
fact regardless of what the defense
12:00
might say about his credibility the
12:02
exact type of person you'd expect to see
12:04
in Trump's orbit and he says that Cohen
12:07
by telling the truth now when he used to
12:10
work for Trump and tell lies is
12:12
redeeming himself is redeeming himself
12:14
in a way that the defendant has not I'm
12:17
curious if you think this tactic seemed
12:20
to kind of work in the moment in the
12:21
room to try to preemptively defend
12:25
against the attacks the prosecution
12:26
expects will be leveled against star
12:29
witness Michael Cohen it's a pretty
12:31
common tactic so I think there's a
12:33
reason prosecutors do it and prosecutors
12:37
have a really difficult task with Cohen
12:40
they have to make him look like a
12:42
criminal too but they also need him to
12:44
testify for them so they need to hold
12:46
him close and hug him tight while also
12:49
making him look like the kind of guy who
12:51
would have made a payoff to a porn star
12:53
to keep her silent right all of this
12:55
suggests that prosecutors are going to
12:57
be very reliant on Michael Cohen
12:59
and his testimony how much of what they
13:02
hope to get from him and his problematic
13:06
background is also available to them in
13:08
the form of documents and other
13:10
corroborating evidence that's exactly
13:12
how Colangelo transitions away from
13:14
talking about Cohen he says the phrase
13:17
extensive paper trail he's saying
13:19
exactly what you're asking Michael they
13:21
do have documents they have a recording
13:23
with Trump on it talking about one of
13:24
the hush money Deals they have things
13:27
that will make Cohen's story add up is
13:30
what he says got it so how does the
13:32
prosecution ultimately end this opening
13:34
statement Colangelo comes back to the
13:38
beginning he says again quote this case
13:41
is about a criminal conspiracy and a
13:43
coverup he acknowledges the bigness of
13:45
the case he encourages jurors to tune
13:48
out the noise you mean the media this
13:50
conversation all of it exactly and then
13:53
he looks at them and he says quote we
13:56
are confident you will have no
13:58
Reasonable Doubt that Donald Trump is
14:00
guilty and he's done and he sits down
14:05
and it's time for the
14:08
[Music]
14:13
defense we'll be right
14:20
back so Jonah tell us about the
14:22
defense's opening arguments because as
14:24
you hinted at the prosecution's case is
14:26
kind of familiar the defense's arguments
14:29
all feel much more novel the defense's
14:32
opening statement is delivered by Todd
14:33
blanch who's defending Trump not only in
14:36
this criminal matter but in some of the
14:38
other ones too he's a former Federal
14:40
prosecutor and he gets up to the podium
14:44
you'll remember that we said that the
14:46
last words that Colangelo spoke were
14:48
Donald Trump is guilty well blanche's
14:51
first words are President Trump is
14:54
innocent so what is blanche's Central
14:58
defense I think I think the defense
15:00
opening statement can be split into two
15:03
separate parts okay the first is no
15:05
crime here there's nothing to see they
15:08
say that a candidate trying to promote
15:10
himself to win a presidential election
15:12
is not a crime and that everything Trump
15:15
did that prosecutors have just described
15:18
the conspiracy exactly is part of the
15:20
normal course of running for office one
15:22
meets with Publishers one promotes
15:24
stories about oneself one perhaps tries
15:27
to put out opposition research to
15:29
promote negative stories about one's
15:30
opponent this is standard practice the
15:33
defense says for a presidential
15:34
candidate okay here I just want to point
15:37
out that it does not seem to be
15:39
traditionally speaking normal standard
15:42
practice to try to catch and kill and
15:44
potentially even reimburse a media
15:46
company for a catch and kill when it
15:48
comes to the story of a sexual affair
15:50
right I mean I think we should just be
15:51
clear about that yeah I nodded
15:52
frantically while you said that because
15:54
you're 100% right this is an unusual
15:57
situation for a presidential candidate
15:59
what does the defense lawyer have to say
16:01
about this concept that what Trump was
16:05
doing was trying to essentially keep
16:08
essential information from the public
16:10
paying off people to deny voters
16:14
essential information he doesn't weigh
16:16
into that territory deeply enough to
16:18
have to counter each and every of the
16:19
prosecution's points and this is a
16:22
classic defense thing you seize on the
16:23
stuff that makes sense to seize on and
16:25
you kind of try and shush away the
16:29
elements that you don't want jurors to
16:30
focus on because think about it if you
16:32
were a juror and you were listening to
16:34
this case and you just heard Todd blanch
16:36
say he was trying to run for president
16:38
how can it be a crime to try and run for
16:40
president especially if you were
16:42
sympathetic to Trump you might think
16:43
well that makes sense and what the
16:45
defense hopes will happen is that these
16:47
little seeds will stick in juror minds
16:50
and when it comes to deliberations weeks
16:52
and weeks from now the jurors will get
16:54
stuck on one of the points that they
16:56
made and the biggest of all seeds seems
16:59
to be blanche's argument that when you
17:02
run for president you do almost anything
17:04
you can to try to win right they want to
17:07
make what the prosecution is describing
17:10
look a lot more normal and a lot less
17:12
seedy than prosecutors want them to
17:15
think and so the other example of that
17:17
the other kind of not crime here
17:19
according to the defense is the
17:21
falsification of business records the
17:23
defense says these business records
17:25
weren't falsified Michael Cohen was a
17:27
lawyer for Trump he was paid by the
17:29
Trump Organization for Legal Services
17:32
AKA his job Trump had nothing to do with
17:35
it anyway and Todd blanch looks at these
17:38
documents these all-important documents
17:40
the prosecution's case and he just
17:42
dismisses them as quote unquote 34
17:44
pieces of paper H so in their telling
17:47
even reimbursing Michael Cohen for
17:50
paying off stmy Daniels potentially can
17:52
be legally construed as him performing
17:55
Legal Services that's right Todd blanch
17:57
wants the jury to believe that this
17:59
repayment was just the normal course of
18:01
business nothing to see here again what
18:04
if anything does Trump's lawyer here
18:06
have to say about the witnesses the
18:09
prosecutors plan to call especially of
18:11
course Michael Cohen Todd blanch has a
18:13
lot to say about Michael Cohen and I had
18:17
thought that blanch would maybe try and
18:19
slow walk his criticism of Cohen because
18:23
there's a little bit of danger here you
18:25
don't want to seem so embittered and so
18:27
angry that you convince the jury that
18:30
you're the one who has an ax to grind
18:33
but blanch ramps up pretty quickly he
18:35
calls him a criminal he calls him a liar
18:39
he accuses Cohen of being completely
18:43
obsessed with Trump he says quote he's
18:45
obsessed with President Trump even to
18:47
this day Cohen is out for Revenge wants
18:50
to see Trump in prison and Cohen
18:52
actually had given the defense a real
18:54
gift because as recently as last night
18:57
the defense said he had called Trump a
18:59
quote despicable human being and said he
19:01
wanted to see the former president
19:02
convicted wow so if blanch is trying to
19:05
argue to jurors hey this guy Michael
19:08
Cohen hates my client Michael Cohen
19:10
helpfully chimes in for the defense and
19:12
says hey I hate president Trump and I
19:14
want to see him go to jail and I want to
19:16
see him convicted H so like the
19:18
prosecution of the defense is putting a
19:19
lot of emphasis on Michael Cohen
19:21
reinforcing the idea that he's very
19:24
essential to this trial yeah I think
19:26
there would be no dispute between the
19:28
prosecution and the defense that Michael
19:30
Cohen has the key story here H okay so
19:33
how does the defense and its opening
19:35
argument blanch ends in a very simple
19:38
straightforward way he asks the jurors
19:40
to use their common sense and he says
19:42
that if they decide the case based on
19:44
the evidence there will be a very Swift
19:47
not- guilty verdict and he sits down and
19:51
at this point it's just before noon M
19:54
and we're all looking at each other
19:55
thinking oh my gosh opening statements
19:58
in this trial are already done we're
20:00
going to get a witness okay so take us
20:04
into this very first witness so as you
20:08
might imagine witness sequence is
20:10
incredibly important you're trying to
20:11
tell the story you told in your opening
20:14
through the testimony of others and this
20:16
is the prosecution witness so this is
20:18
the first prosecution witness and it's
20:20
David pecker the former publisher of the
20:22
national Inquirer and what is Pecker's
20:25
testimony pecker doesn't get too far
20:28
into his story story but he does start
20:30
to lay out the way that the national
20:31
Inquirer worked and one thing he says
20:34
and I think this is a bit of a problem
20:36
for the defense is he says that the
20:38
national Inquirer operated through quote
20:40
unquote checkbook journalism and just
20:42
explain that which is a neat way of
20:43
saying they paid people for stories but
20:46
remember we talked about this jury is
20:47
highly educated there's a good chance
20:50
they're quite media literate media Savvy
20:52
they're going to know that this is not
20:53
the way that normal newspapers operated
20:56
and so this is a great thing for the
20:58
prosecutor and this is why it's their
20:59
witness already David pecker is laying
21:02
out a modus operandi at the national
21:04
Inquirer that just isn't that normal and
21:08
the day ends shortly after that but we
21:10
can already see where pecker is going
21:12
when he returns to the stand on Tuesday
21:15
he is going to describe how this form of
21:18
quote unquote journalism this checkbook
21:20
journalism mattered to Trump and
21:22
mattered in Trump's campaign and that's
21:24
the way that prosecutors will begin to
21:27
illustrate the story that they told with
21:30
opening statements and eventually what
21:32
they hope that they'll have is this cast
21:34
of characters these Witnesses who will
21:37
bring the conspiracy that they accused
21:39
Donald Trump of participating in to
21:41
Vivid life Jonah we haven't talked much
21:44
about Trump he's in the room this entire
21:46
time he's sitting there at the defense
21:48
table I'm curious if you or our
21:51
colleagues captured any notable
21:54
reactions from him I mean after all he's
21:57
beginning the process of watching those
21:59
he once entrusted with helping him get
22:02
elected turn on
22:04
him I become used to seeing Trump
22:08
minimized in the courtroom because he's
22:10
just there day after day because he's
22:12
not the center of attention right and I
22:14
think that was really true today I can
22:16
describe a couple of reactions for
22:18
instance he shook his head when
22:20
prosecutors said he was guilty that was
22:21
one of the main things that he did that
22:24
caught our attention and then the thing
22:26
that caught my eye is finally we're done
22:28
for the day and Trump stands up and he
22:31
looks really angry he looks really
22:34
really angry
22:37
Trump and he walks out of court I get
22:39
indicted I'm the leading candidate I'm
22:41
beating Biden I'm beating the
22:44
Republicans now I have the
22:46
nomination and this is what they try and
22:48
take me off the trail for and he gives
22:51
an angry speech but they call the
22:53
payment to a lawyer a legal expense in
22:57
the books
22:59
they didn't call it construction they
23:00
didn't say you're building a building
23:02
called with a familiar kind of language
23:05
and when are they going to look at all
23:06
the lies that
23:08
Cohen did in the last trial he got
23:10
caught lying in the last trial attacks
23:12
on people attacks on Cohen because the
23:14
public understands that it's a Witch
23:17
Hunt thank you very much Mr Trump what
23:19
was it like heing and then he gets in
23:21
his SUV and he leaves the day in which
23:24
prosecutors accused him essentially to
23:26
his face of commit 34 felonies right
23:31
Jonah it would seem very hard to draw a
23:33
lot of meaningful Impressions from just
23:35
oral arguments but in this single day
23:38
you have the prosecution and the defense
23:41
lawyer standing up and developing a
23:43
rapport with the jury and introducing
23:47
what they would regard as the strongest
23:48
versions of their case and I'm kind of
23:50
curious as a longtime court reporter if
23:53
you felt after today a strong sense of
23:57
which team seems like it's a little bit
24:00
more on top of their game and is
24:02
presenting a stronger version of events
24:04
to the jury or if it's just too early to
24:06
say what I'll say is the
24:08
prosecution has a very clear very
24:12
structured narrative MH the defense has
24:15
a lot of things to say about that story
24:17
and they're picking off little elements
24:19
they're saying well Cohen's a liar
24:21
Stormy Daniels is an opportunist and by
24:23
the way there's no crime here there's no
24:25
crime in terms of trying to win the
24:26
election there's no crime in terms of
24:28
falsifying any documents so those kind
24:31
of individual blows that they're trying
24:34
to land one of them can work or many of
24:36
them could work what the defense didn't
24:38
seem to have today was an alternative
24:41
narrative and so of course their burdens
24:43
are different the defense is just trying
24:44
to seeed Reasonable Doubt the
24:46
prosecution has to prove their case but
24:48
the prosecution is telling a story and
24:50
the defense is saying that story's not
24:53
quite right the defense is not
24:55
necessarily telling a competing story
24:58
got it I wanted to just end Jonah with a
25:01
reminder of the stakes of this case
25:03
which I think tend to get lost in the
25:05
day-to-day coverage of it there are as
25:07
we've been talking about 34 felony
25:10
charges and this is the first criminal
25:12
case to go to trial before the election
25:14
and we think perhaps the only criminal
25:17
case to go to trial before the election
25:18
if Trump wins this case it's quite
25:20
clearly a huge Vindication for him and
25:23
he can go around saying as much if he
25:27
loses what what are the actual legal
25:30
consequences so the legal consequences
25:32
those are easy to talk about it's an
25:34
indeterminate prison sentence but we
25:35
know it could be up to four years right
25:37
but the political consequences which I
25:39
think are of great interest to a lot of
25:41
people are very very difficult to talk
25:44
about when Trump was indicted his poll
25:47
numbers actually went up right and this
25:49
was the first indictment that's right
25:50
and so there's no clear indication that
25:53
being convicted here would necessarily
25:55
hurt him politically
25:59
I think a lot of people who dislike
26:02
Trump were hoping that these criminal
26:04
cases would just kind of take him out of
26:05
the picture but we don't know that
26:07
that's going to happen and so even as we
26:10
start to get into the heart of this case
26:12
and to hear the evidence and hear the
26:13
testimony and to see what the jurors are
26:16
seeing and try and predict whether Trump
26:18
is going to be found guilty or not
26:20
guilty we still have no idea what a
26:23
conviction would actually mean or how it
26:26
would affect the election
26:30

26:48
me we'll be right
26:57
back here's what else you need to know
26:59
today during oral arguments on Monday a
27:03
majority of the Supreme Court appeared
27:05
ready to uphold a series of local laws
27:08
that allowed Grants Pass a small city in
27:12
Oregon to ban homeless people from
27:14
sleeping in public spaces the case which
27:18
was covered on Friday's episode of The
27:20
Daily has sweeping implications for how
27:24
the entire country deals with the
27:26
growing crisis of homeless
27:29
and tensions over the war in Gaza are
27:32
escalating on the campuses of several
27:35
Elite
27:36
Universities at Yale and New York
27:39
University Police on Monday arrested
27:41
dozens of protesters who defied orders
27:44
to disperse at Harvard administrators
27:48
said they plan to close Harvard Yard to
27:51
avoid unauthorized demonstrations and at
27:54
Colombia where protesters have set up a
27:57
large encampment
27:58
the University's president faced calls
28:01
to resign from all 10 House Republicans
28:05
from the state of New York in a letter
