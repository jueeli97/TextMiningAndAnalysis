0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael borro
0:04
this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:10
daily
0:12
today a bombshell legal settlement
0:15
reached a few days ago is about to
0:17
change almost everything about buying
0:20
and selling a home and in the process
0:23
make it significantly cheaper my
0:26
colleague Deborah Cayman explains
0:34
it's Wednesday March
0:37
[Music]
The National Association of Realtors
0:43
20th hi Deborah hi Michael what a treat
0:47
talk of this is surreal do you want me
0:49
just to go no I'm going to ask you a
0:50
question ready this is a conversation
0:52
mean I came ready to roll what do you
0:54
want so Deborah at the highest possible
0:58
level what just happened to American
1:01
Real Estate Michael there's been this
1:02
invisible hand that's been guiding and
1:05
controlling the real estate industry for
1:06
over 100 years and they have long
1:08
thought that they were absolutely
1:09
Untouchable because they had so much
1:11
power so much influence so much money
1:14
and the biggest crack in their armor
1:16
that's ever happened just happened on
1:18
Friday H well what is this crack in the
1:21
armor and I guess who even is this
1:23
nefarious sounding group that you're
1:24
talking about the group is the National
1:27
Association of Realtors nearly n out of
1:29
10 home sales are handled by real estate
1:31
agents affiliated with n and the crack
1:34
in the armor is that they have had these
1:36
rules that have controlled how much
1:38
buyers and sellers pay to their agents
1:40
and how you work with agents to get a
1:42
home on the market and then last week
1:44
for the first time in its history n's
1:46
control over this huge industry which we
1:48
all thought was Untouchable it basically
1:51
collapsed and with it so did many of the
1:54
costs it was imposing on consumers okay
1:58
this sounds huge I think we need to slow
2:00
this whole thing down and I think the
2:03
way to do that is to have you tell us
2:05
the story of how the National
2:08
Association of Realtors which is not at
2:10
all a household name became such a
2:14
powerful force
2:16
in the ritual of buying and selling a
2:18
home in the United
2:20
States the N is huge over there
2:23
existance theyve grown to 1.5 million
2:27
members more importantly they've created
2:29
a system where you really cannot sell a
2:31
house unless you're a member they even
2:34
own the copyright to the word realtor
2:37
they own the copyright to the word
2:39
realtor they own the copyright they even
2:41
had a campaign a couple years ago to
2:42
convince people how to say properly and
2:44
correctly they take this very seriously
2:46
okay okay I'll bite how do you say it
2:47
proper it's real tour not real Tor real
2:50
tour two syllables not three okay very
2:52
important extremely important so I
2:54
should say on paper you can sell a house
2:56
if you're not a real tour if you're just
2:58
a real estate agent not a m n exactly
3:01
but in practice it's really not that
3:03
easy because of the system they've
3:04
created they make it very difficult for
3:07
example if you want to list a home for
3:09
sale you have to put it on something
3:10
called an MLs a multiple listing service
3:12
and mls's for the most part are owned
3:14
and operated by the local subsidiaries
3:16
of n they control the databases in which
3:20
homes basically enter the market exactly
3:23
and not only the databases in which
3:25
homes enter the market but the databases
3:27
through which real tours tell each other
3:29
how much they will get paid if they sell
3:31
those homes and the databases are very
3:34
important because databases are where
3:36
real estate agents can see how much
3:38
commission they will make if they bring
3:39
a buyer or they sell a home typically
3:42
when you sell a house in the US you pay
3:43
a commission fee it's usually around
3:45
five or 6% to Realtors this is how
3:47
realtors are making their money it's
3:49
what you're paying them for everything
3:50
they're doing listing the house showing
3:52
the house answering all your questions
3:53
making improvements in the house yeah
3:55
and it's how they make a living but it's
3:57
a very high rate 5 or 6% is one of the
3:59
highest rates in the world almost no
4:01
other developed country has a rate that
4:08
high okay and let's talk about 6% for
The 6 Fee
4:10
just a minute that's a number everyone
4:13
knows if you've ever especially sold a
4:15
home because it's a number you hate you
4:17
hate the fact no offense to realtors
4:20
that you have to give
4:23
6% of the money you get for your home to
4:27
a real estate agent right well two real
4:29
estate agents because it gets split half
4:31
goes to the seller agent half goes to
4:33
the buyer agent right and just to put it
4:35
in perspective because I think it's
4:36
useful if you're selling a million
4:37
dollar house 6% fee is $60,000 if you're
4:41
selling a half million dollar house it's
4:43
$30,000 either way you slice it it's a
4:45
lot of money to put in somebody else's
4:47
pocket for a huge investment that you
4:50
made you're trying to get the money into
4:52
your pocket but it's coming out of your
4:54
pocket and going to the agent exactly
4:56
you're saying the National Association
4:58
of Realtors should be seen as
5:00
essentially the force behind that 6% fee
5:04
the loathed 6% fee staying what it has
5:08
been for so long n will say we never set
5:11
6% we don't have 6% set in stone that is
5:13
true but they created rules that led to
5:16
a system where that 6% has become the
5:19
industry standard and anyone trying to
5:21
challenge it their business model has
5:22
fallen apart fascinating and here's how
5:25
they control the market for example if
5:26
you're a real estate agent and you want
5:27
to open that home for a customer in most
5:30
markets n controls the lock boxes that
5:32
you use to open the homes everyone knows
5:34
what those lock boxes look like with the
5:35
little punch key n actually owns one of
5:38
the two companies in America that makes
5:39
those lock boxes wow and in many markets
5:41
they require their agents to use their
5:43
own technology and then let's say you
5:45
open the home you bring a buyer you want
5:47
to sell the home the actual technology
5:49
that you use to sell the home which is
5:51
DocuSign they own a controlling stake in
5:54
that company so every aspect of the home
5:56
selling transaction from the very
5:58
beginning to the very end that hand of n
6:01
is guiding it and behind it and it's
6:03
been there for 100 years wow I mean that
6:05
sounds an awful lot like monopolistic
6:08
level of power the word monopoly gets
6:11
thrown around all the time when critics
6:12
are talking about n another word that
6:15
comes up a lot is the word cartel
6:17
there's a lot of power there's a lot of
6:18
control and there's also a very
6:21
organized drive to go after anyone who
6:23
tries to challenge them H this is just
6:27
not a level of influence that I
6:30
associate with the trade group I think
6:31
of trade groups as kind of gathering
6:33
people together for professional
6:34
development having a happy hour at the
6:36
hotel right exactly not controlling a
6:39
toz elements of the industry if there
6:41
was an n in journalism it sounds like
6:43
they would control the printing presses
6:45
how is it possible that no private
6:48
company has come along and tried to
6:49
break into this n controlled Market or
6:51
that the government hasn't looked at it
6:54
and thought cartel Monopoly we got to
6:56
bust this up people have definitely
6:58
tried so it's not that its people have
7:00
not tried the challenge is that n
7:02
because they have so much power they
7:03
have quashed any attempts at challenging
7:05
them like what they sue the heck out of
7:08
anybody who comes after them there have
7:10
been upstart companies that have tried
7:11
to advertise homes outside of these
7:13
multiple listing services that n
7:15
controls and N has sued them and then
7:18
you get buried in tens of thousands of
7:20
dollars of legal fees for an upstart
7:21
tech company right that's a death blow
7:24
what about the government the government
7:25
has also been going after n for more
7:28
than 20 years the doj and N have been
7:30
locked into battle back and forth since
7:33
2005 but in terms of the government n is
7:36
not just a Trade Organization they are
7:38
also a political action committee they
7:40
have the largest pack in Washington in
7:42
terms of dollars raised and they give
7:44
millions of dollars to candidates who
7:46
are in line with their agenda and they
7:48
spend millions of dollars fighting
7:49
candidates who are not in line with
7:51
their
7:52
[Music]
7:55
agenda so anyone in the government who
7:57
wants to go after n knows that they are
7:59
fighting a battle that probably is
8:01
bigger and more moneyed than they really
8:02
want to deal with right sounds a little
8:05
bit like another Washington organization
8:08
with similar acronym which is the NRA
8:11
the National wildfield Association which
8:12
has kept a very strong lid on efforts to
8:15
challenge its Authority with campaign
8:18
dollars there is a playbook for this
8:19
sort of behavior and it is followed
8:21
pretty clearly right but I don't think
8:24
any of us quite understood it was
8:25
happening in the housing market right
8:28
and at the end of the day it wasn't the
8:29
government that brought them down and it
8:31
wasn't a venture capital firm with a ton
8:33
of money fighting them or trying to be
8:35
an upstart group it was five normal
8:38
bluecollar homeowners and a personal
8:40
injury lawyer from Missouri who had
8:42
never dealt with the housing market
8:43
before in his
8:47
life we'll be right
8:52
[Music]
8:58
back so deor tell us about this
The Story
9:00
unexpected cast of characters that ends
9:03
up bringing down the National
9:05
Association of real Alors so Michael in
9:07
2018 2019 there was a group of Home
9:09
sellers in Missouri who had learned that
9:12
they had paid pretty high fees to their
9:14
real estate agents and they might have a
9:16
legal case against them they were
9:17
probably paying that kind of standard 6%
9:21
fee to their agents when they sold the
9:23
house right they were paying the
9:24
standard 6% fee but the key was they had
9:26
not known that that fee was actually
9:27
negotiable they thought they had to pay
9:29
it okay here I need to pause it is
9:32
actually negotiable it is actually
9:35
negotiable it is it is and that's the
9:37
thing n has always said we don't set the
9:40
fees there is no standard fee but in
9:42
practice if consumers don't know that
9:45
the fee isn't negotiable and if
9:46
consumers are told by their agents that
9:48
they cannot negotiate the fee that is
9:50
the fee H okay so these folks discover
9:55
that perhaps they didn't need to pay
9:57
6% and did what do they do they
10:00
contacted a lawyer and they started
10:02
going through the contracts that they'd
10:03
signed when they sold their homes MH so
10:06
one of the people went back through her
10:07
contract and the contract actually said
10:09
what fee do you want to pay your agent
10:10
and it said 6% 7% 8% or 9% so she did
10:14
the smart thing and she chose the lowest
10:15
fee circled 6% and that's what she paid
10:18
right in other words like a tipping
10:20
machine that says 20 22 25 when buy a
10:23
coffee and the the tip starts at 22% ex
10:26
it's inconceivable if there's anything
10:27
beneath that or that you actually could
10:29
off out right exactly okay someone else
10:32
he's the son of a factory worker he's
10:34
now the head of Mothers Against Drunk
10:35
Driving in Missouri these are really
10:37
blue collar people he was told that he
10:39
was going to be charged 5.5% he found
10:41
out later that he was charged 6% so his
10:44
agent just jacked up the fee without
10:45
telling him so all these people realized
10:48
we left money on the table at the most
10:50
important financial transaction of our
10:51
entire lives and we probably have a
10:53
legal claim against the institution that
10:55
set the rules that made it so this was
10:57
possible n AR n are so not only are they
11:01
upset that they had to pay 6% and they
11:03
could have negotiated it and did not
11:04
know they also are realizing that they
11:07
have paid the fee to the agent that's
11:09
representing the person that they're
11:11
going against in the negotiation for the
11:12
home sale which is the buyer which is
11:14
the buyer right cuz as you said earlier
11:16
the nature of the 6% fee is that it is
11:19
split between the sell's agent and the
11:22
buyer agent which no one really tells
11:24
you or reminds you but that's what
11:25
happens because it's all happening
11:26
through a back door on these multiple
11:28
listing sites that you can only see if
11:30
you're a real estate agent Who belongs
11:31
to
The Lawsuit
11:34
n okay so what ends up happening to all
11:39
these sellers once they discover in
11:41
their minds that they've been wronged
11:43
and that they want to do something about
11:44
it they hire this attorney Michael
11:46
katchmark he's a personal injury lawyer
11:48
from Missouri pretty much nobody outside
11:50
of Kansas City had heard of him until
11:52
this moment he decides he's going to
11:54
file a class action
11:55
lawsuit this is not the best time for n
11:58
this is actually the moment that they
11:59
were really coming onto my radar as a
12:01
reporter I had spent last summer focused
12:03
on sexual harassment allegations at n
12:06
and I discovered that n's president his
12:08
name was Kenny parcel had years and
12:11
years of sexual harassment accusations
12:12
against him that had been covered up and
12:14
women had been paid off and at the times
12:16
we published a big expose on those
12:18
allegations at the end of August and he
12:21
stepped down two days later you're
12:22
reporting got the head of this
12:24
incredibly powerful
12:26
organization to step down it did and
12:28
there have been other Nation since then
12:30
and that moment for n really put them on
12:33
the world stage suddenly people are
12:35
aware that the leader of the
12:36
organization is an alleged sexual
12:38
harasser and women who've been
12:40
whistleblowers about the sexual
12:41
harassment have been paid off and all of
12:44
that is happening at n behind the scenes
12:47
when this case where they're being
12:48
accused of price fixing ends up going to
12:51
trial got it okay so what ends up
12:53
happening to this case as it moves
12:57
through the legal system just as n AR's
12:59
leader has been forced out so the case
13:03
goes forward and Nar says okay we have a
13:04
new president we're kind of in disarray
13:06
but we are going to regroup we're going
13:08
to fight this we're absolutely not going
13:09
to settle okay what ends up happening at
13:11
this trial they come gunsblazing High
13:14
powerered corporate lawyers black suits
13:16
tons of money and up against then you
13:18
have catchmark and his team of
13:20
plaintiffs and the jury really liked
13:24
what catchmark had to say a Kansas City
13:26
jury found the National Association of
13:28
Realtors and other organizations
13:30
conspired to keep realtor commission
13:32
fees high they agreed that these home
13:35
sellers were not told that they could
13:37
negotiate the prices the plaintiffs
13:39
argued the organizations forced home
13:41
sellers to pay both the seller and buyer
13:43
fees calling that practice wrong and
13:46
illegal so late in October of last year
13:48
n is found guilty of price fixing and
13:51
the jury came back and said yeah you're
13:53
guilty and the damages are $1.8 billion
13:56
wow what we proved was the National
13:58
Association of real
13:59
has joined in a conspiracy with the two
14:01
of the largest corporate real estate
14:03
brokers to to use the system to to fix
14:07
prices so what happens within hours of
14:10
this verdict coming through is the
14:12
floodgates open the minute that that
14:15
verdict came in we we filed the lawsuit
14:17
against the National Association of
14:19
Realtors and these other large corporate
14:21
real estate companies to bring the same
14:22
relief Nationwide catchmark turns around
14:25
the same day that he won this case and
14:28
files a national case so we're talking
14:31
the exact same argument but now it's not
14:33
just Missouri it's the whole country the
14:35
money will be returned to the homeowners
14:37
that were the victims of this rig system
14:39
it's been going on in our country for
14:40
about 100 years and it stops today wow
14:43
so every every single person who sold a
14:46
home in the past four years is now part
14:50
of this case if they paid a 6%
14:52
commission and didn't know it wow across
14:54
the country already since that case a
14:56
case filed by buyers in Illinois also
14:59
sellers in Missouri New York Texas and
15:02
South Carolina there's also an Illinois
15:04
case that was other copycat Suits start
15:06
happening and within weeks we're up to
15:07
almost 20 lawsuits against n all saying
15:11
you are a monopoly you have antitrust
15:13
violations and these rules need to
The Settlement
15:18
change been a major shakeup in the real
15:21
estate world today if a settlement is
15:23
approved in court homes make it cheaper
15:27
and agents and brokers could be out of
15:29
business so in the face of all these
15:31
lawsuits n finally agrees to settle and
15:34
late last week early Friday morning they
15:36
agreed to a settlement that includes
15:38
massive changes that are going to
15:40
introduce competition into the
15:41
marketplace the biggest one being the
15:44
rules that led to that 6% commission are
15:47
gone gone gone so is the 6% fee perhaps
15:51
now gone it will it will go away because
15:53
competition is now going to enter the
15:55
marketplace and when competition comes
15:57
in people have to lower their fees as a
15:59
result a really good example if you want
16:01
to look at a precedent in history is the
16:03
travel industry it used to be if you
16:05
wanted to book a vacation or buy a
16:06
flight you had to go through a travel
16:08
agent and you had to pay what they told
16:09
you to pay but then we had things enter
16:12
the marketplace like Expedia and kayak
16:14
and Price Line the same way we now have
16:15
Zillow and redin we do a lot of the
16:18
searching for homes ourselves just not
16:19
the buying in the but the fees for
16:21
searching for a home have not changed
16:23
even though the service itself has it's
16:25
a lot cheaper now to book travel than it
16:26
was when you had to go through an agent
16:28
it's going be a lot cheaper to book a
16:30
real estate agent now as well to sell
16:32
your home okay I think I understand I
16:34
want to talk about what it would mean
16:36
for the 6% commission to go away because
16:40
as we' talked about previously in this
16:42
conversation that was the immovable fact
16:45
of buying and selling a home and a huge
16:49
amount of money a huge amount of money
16:51
Americans spend about hundred billion
16:53
dollar a year on real estate commissions
16:55
alone unbelievable Economist forecast
16:57
that they're probably going to see that
16:58
number drop up by 20 to 50 billion
17:01
because these commissions are going to
17:02
go down but where it really matters is
17:05
housing prices housing prices have
17:08
become higher because real estate
17:10
commissions are baked into the housing
17:12
price right if you're selling a house
17:14
and your agent says to you when you sell
17:16
this house you're going to have to pay a
17:17
6% fee so we're just going to bump up
17:19
the price of the house by 6% to absorb
17:21
that cost so imagine now those fees
17:23
going down across the board that bump up
17:26
is going down as well so housing prices
17:28
are going to dip
17:29
right it's one of the most significant
17:31
changes we've seen to the Housing
17:32
Industry in 100 years yeah I when you
17:35
think about it if you take a 6% fixed
17:39
fee in the system and you get rid of it
17:41
and if you're right housing prices fall
17:44
what this n change means is that the
17:46
entire US housing market is about to be
17:50
discounted it's about to go on sale it's
17:52
the prices are about to drop absolutely
17:54
okay what else does a settlement do the
17:57
other major change is that that if you
17:59
are a sellers agent and you're listing a
18:00
home for sale you can no longer make an
18:02
offer of commission to the Buyer Agents
18:05
on these MLS databases so Buyer Agents
18:08
will no longer be able to say hey I'm
18:10
only going to take people to homes where
18:12
I know I'm guaranteed to get 3% H okay I
18:15
I want to just make sure I understand
18:16
that so in addition to this settlement
18:18
essentially ending the reign of the 6%
18:21
commission it's ending this kind of
18:25
informal conspiracy that's been going on
18:27
between buyers a and seller agents where
18:30
they kind of wink and Nod at each other
18:31
and say I'm going to get my 3% you're
18:33
going to get your 3% in fact what it
18:35
does is it kind of ends the very nature
18:37
of the two colluding over who's going to
18:40
get what there was nothing informal
18:41
about it it was happening in broad
18:43
daylight on these mls's right but of
18:45
course we weren't on those Ms we didn't
18:46
know exactly and now we know okay so
18:48
those are two colossal changes to the
18:52
market but it leaves me with a question
18:54
this settlement sounds like it
18:55
represents people who were in the class
18:57
action lawsuits
18:59
but if I sold a home I don't know like 3
19:02
four years ago and I look at this
19:05
settlement and I say congratulations to
19:07
those in it but what about me what about
19:09
the fact that I and a million and a half
19:12
other people we paid our 6% fees what's
19:15
in it for us yes Michael Barbaro you
19:17
could also make money from the
19:19
settlement and I Deborah Cayman could
19:20
also make money from the settlement the
19:22
settlement is a global settlement
19:24
because there were so many lawsuits
19:25
going on at once it didn't just settle
19:27
that case in Missouri with the five
19:29
homeowners it settled all of them it's a
19:31
class action suit that applies to almost
19:33
every person in America who sold a home
19:36
over the last few years interesting and
19:38
over the next few years it's going to
19:39
take a while but we're all going to get
19:41
letters that are going to ask us if you
19:42
sold a home and if you paid commission
19:44
right and you know we've all gotten
19:45
these letters were you part of did you
19:46
buy a piece of meat from the supermarket
19:48
on the state did you buy a piece of the
19:49
housing market on the state is the
19:50
letters we're going to get and depending
19:52
on how many people fill out these
19:54
letters and send them back and how big
19:56
that pot of money has grown to by the of
19:58
it because there's still some lawsuits
20:00
that are simmering that money is going
20:02
to be divied up and parts of it are
20:03
going to go to homeowners no one's going
20:05
to get rich off of this but yes we all
20:07
stand to get a small chunk of it if this
20:09
is in fact as you're describing it a
20:12
Kind of Revolution in the American Real
20:14
Estate industry the downfall of n the
20:16
changes of all these
20:18
rules we know that revolutions can be
20:20
very fast or they can be very slow and
20:22
I'm curious if you can in your mind's
20:25
eye kind of imagine what the real estate
20:28
market is going to look like in 5 or 10
20:30
years and how much better or more
20:34
accessible it might be for people as a
20:36
result of these changes and I'm asking
20:38
that in particular because here on the
20:39
daily we've talked so much about how
20:41
cruel the US housing market is right now
20:44
there's a shortage prices are really
20:46
high and young people in particular feel
20:48
completely locked out of the market and
20:50
so is this really going to do something
20:54
about that or is it really going to only
20:55
feel like it's at the margins no it will
20:57
help them but not in the clean easy way
20:59
that you may think one of the major
21:01
fallouts of the settlement is going to
21:03
be the fact that n stands to lose
21:05
something like 2third of its members why
21:07
because the major reason people have
21:09
stayed members of N is because they
21:11
needed access to home listings and they
21:13
control the home listings now that that
21:15
access has been broken by the settlement
21:17
deals people are fed up with n they pay
21:20
hundreds of dollars a year to be a
21:21
member and now they're saying what do
21:22
you do for me after all this you lost in
21:25
court and now I don't even have access
21:26
to these listings for my commission so
21:29
when they lose 2third of their members
21:32
that group is now also losing 2third of
21:34
the people who donate to their political
21:35
action committee and that lobbying arm
21:37
in Washington has now been very
21:39
significantly blunted and that lobbying
21:41
arm in Washington is one of the biggest
21:43
forces behind Pro landlord policies
21:45
stopping things like rent control all of
21:48
the initiatives in DC that have made the
21:49
housing market so very brutal for so
21:52
many Americans so in the long run this
21:54
is going to have a serious impact that
21:56
would completely change the Dynamics of
21:58
the real estate market so if we take the
22:00
N Out of the equation we get a more
22:05
consumer tenant friendly housing market
22:08
and that is very likely to happen
22:11
because this settlement essentially
22:14
kneecaps n and leaves its current
22:17
members with no real incentive to stay
22:19
members that is absolutely correct so
22:21
it's going to take time but there's
22:22
going to be all sorts of Ripple effects
22:24
from this that go well beyond $418
22:26
million right at the end end of the day
22:30
Deborah this feels like the story of a
22:33
monopoly that outlived all other
22:36
monopolies in our system right I mean
22:38
American economic history is littered
22:40
with the story of Industries where a
22:43
group or a company have a strangle hold
22:45
and it gets broken up that's the idea of
22:48
a fair economy this one lasted so long
22:52
despite the fact that what it controlled
22:54
was a pillar of the American dream which
22:55
is owning a home and I wonder
22:59
how you think about the fact that it
23:01
took so long to do it it genuinely
23:03
shocks me I guess I'm saying that this
23:06
Dynamic lasted as long as it did it
23:09
shocks me too and I have to say when I
23:11
started this beat about a year ago I
23:13
didn't know what n was most Americans
23:15
had no idea that this organization had
23:18
so much control and so much power over
23:20
the housing market the housing market is
23:21
20% of the US GDP this is a huge
23:24
organization that's been guiding
23:25
everything from the
David vs Goliath
23:27
wings but what I love about this story
23:30
is at the end of the day it was just
23:31
five normal home sellers who took them
23:33
on in court in Kansas City and a
23:35
personal injury lawyer and they won and
23:39
that irony is not lost on the lawyer he
23:41
after the settlement sent me a quote it
23:43
was a David versus Goliath quote from
23:45
the Bible that is how he sees himself
23:47
and in many ways that is what this story
23:49
is it's one of those stories where the
23:52
little guy went up against the biggest
23:53
guy there was and they won and a lot of
23:56
regular Americans now stand to to
23:58
benefit from this because of its impact
24:00
on the housing
24:02
[Music]
24:05
market well Deborah thank you very much
24:08
well Michael thank you very
24:13
much a federal court is expected to give
24:17
final approval to the N AR's legal
24:20
settlement and make it official in the
24:22
coming
24:24
[Music]
24:27
weeks we'll be right
Outro

back here's what else you need to
24:35
another day on Tuesday Israeli Prime
24:38
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he
24:41
would push ahead with a planned ground
24:43
invasion of the Southern Gaza City of
24:46
Rafa despite pleas for restraint from
24:49
the United States which has warned it
24:52
could be disastrous for the civilians
24:54
there in remarks to his cabinet
24:57
Netanyahu IGN knowledge that the White
24:59
House had asked him not to invade Rafa
25:02
but said that he sees no way to
25:04
eliminate Hamas without doing
