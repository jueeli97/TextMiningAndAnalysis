0:38
Thursday so on one side of R you see camera Crews you see NYPD officers all
0:43
lined up there's barricades steel barricades caution tape this is normally
0:49
a completely open campus and I'm able to um all members of
0:56
the public you're able to walk through looks like uh International media is
1:02
here have your IDs out have your IDs out students lining up to swipe in uh to get
1:08
access to the University ID required for entry um hi how are you officer uh we're
1:15
journalists with the New York Times you're not going to be get in all right sorry thank you yeah it's it's total
1:22
lockdown here at Columbia please have your IDs to swi from The New York Times
1:28
I'm Michael borro this is the daily today the story of how Colombia
1:34
University has become the epicenter of a growing showdown between student
1:40
protesters College administrators and Congress over the war in Gaza and the
1:47
limits of free speech I spoke with my colleague Nick
1:57
fandos it's Thursday April [Music]
2:03
25th Nick if we rewind the clock a few months we end up at a moment where
2:09
students at several of the country's best known universities are protesting Israel's response to the October 7th
2:16
attacks its approach to a war in Gaza at times those protests are happening
2:22
peacefully at times with rhetoric that is inflammatory and the result is that the
2:28
leaders of those universities land before Congress but the President of
2:34
columia University which is the subject we're going to be talking about today is not one of the leaders who shows up for
2:41
that testimony that's right so the house education committee has been watching
2:46
all these protests on campus and the Republican chairwoman decides I'm going to open an investigation look at how
2:53
these administrations are handling it because it doesn't look good from where I sit and the house last winter inv
2:59
invites the leaders of several of these Elite schools Harvard Penn MIT and Colombia to come and testify in
3:07
Washington on Capitol Hill before Congress now the president of Columbia has what turns out to be a very
3:14
well-timed pre-planned trip to go overseas and speak at an international climate conference so Manu shafik isn't
3:21
going to be there so instead the presidence of Harvard and Penn and MIT show up and it turned out to be a
3:28
disaster right these universities they were asked very pointed questions about
3:34
the kind of speech taking place on their campuses and they gave really convoluted
3:39
kind of academic answers back that just baffled the committee but there was one
3:44
question that really embodied the kind of Disconnect between the committee and it wasn't just Republicans Republicans
3:50
and Democrats on the committee and these college presidents and that's when they were asked a hypothetical does calling
3:55
for the genocide of Jews violate Penn's rules or code of conduct yes or
4:02
no if the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment and two of the presidents claudian gay of Harvard and
4:08
Elizabeth McGill of the University of Pennsylvania they're unwilling to say in this really kind of intense back and
4:14
forth that this speech would constitute a violation of their rules it can be depending on the context what's the
4:21
context targeted as at an individual it's targeted at Jewish students Jewish
4:27
individuals do you understand your testimony is dehumanizing them and it sets off a firestorm it does not depend
4:35
on the context the answer is yes and this is why you should resign these are unacceptable answers across the board
4:42
members of Congress start calling for their resignations alumni are really really ticked off Trustees of the
4:47
University start to wonder uh I don't know that these leaders really have got this under control uh and eventually
4:54
both of them lose their jobs in a really high-profile way right and as you've hinted at for somewhat peculiar
5:00
scheduling reasons Colombia's president escapes This Disaster of a hearing in
5:08
what has to be regarded as the best timing in the history of the American
5:13
Academy yeah exactly and Colombia is watching all this play out and I think their first response was relief that she
5:20
was not in that chair but also recognition that sooner or later their turn was going to come back around and
5:26
they were going to have to sit before Congress why were they so certain that they would probably end up before
5:32
Congress and that this wasn't a case of completely dodging a bullet will they remain under investigation by the
5:38
committee but also as the winter wears on all the same intense protests just
5:44
continue unabated so in many ways Colombia is like these other campuses but in some ways it's even more intense
5:51
this is a university that has both one of the largest Jewish student populations of any of its peers but it
5:57
also has a large Arab Muslim student population a big Middle Eastern studies
6:03
program it has a dual degree program in Tel Aviv and it's a university on top of
6:09
all that that has a real history of activism dating back to the 1960s so when students are recruited or choose to
6:15
come to Colombia they're actively opting into a campus that Prides itself on being an activist Community it's in the
6:22
middle of New York City it's a global place you know they consider the city and the world really like a classroom to
6:28
Colombia in other words if any campus was going to be a hotbed of protest and
6:35
debate over this conflict it was going to be Columbia University exactly and
6:42
when this spring rolls around the Stars finally align and the same Congressional committee issues another invitation to
6:48
Manu shafik Columbia's president to come and testify and this time she has no excuse to say no but presumably she is
6:57
well aware of exactly what testifying before this committee ENT tals and is highly prepared Colombia knew this
7:04
moment was coming they spent months preparing for this hearing they brought in outside Consultants crisis
7:10
communicators experts on anti-Semitism the weekend before the hearing she actually travels down to
7:17
Washington to Hole up in a war room where she starts preparing her testimony with Mock questioners and testy
7:23
exchanges to prep her for this and she's very clear on what she wants to try to do where her her counterparts had gone
7:30
before the committee a few months before and looked aloof she wanted to project
7:35
humility and competence to say I know that there's an issue on my campus right
7:41
now with some of these protests veering off into anti-semitic incidents but I'm
7:46
getting that under control I'm taking steps in good faith to make sure that we restore order to this campus while
7:52
allowing people to express themselves freely as well okay so then the day of
7:58
her actual testimony arrives and just walk us through how it goes the
8:03
committee on education and the workforce will come to order I note that so Wednesday morning rolls around and
8:09
president shafik sits at the witness stand with two of her trustees and the head of Columbia's new anti-Semitism
8:15
task force Colombia stands guilty of gross negligence at best and at worst
8:21
has become a platform for those supporting terrorism and violence against the Jewish people and right off
8:28
the bat there put through a pretty humbling Litany of some of the worst hits of what's been happening on campus
8:34
for example Just 4 days after the harrowing October 7 attack a former
8:40
Colombia undergraduate beat an Israeli student with a stick while the
8:45
Republican chairwoman of the committee Virginia Fox starts reminding her that there was a student who was actually hit
8:51
with a stick on campus there was another gathering more recently glorifying Hamas
8:56
and other terrorist organizations and the kind of chance that have become an everyday chorus on campus which many
9:03
Jewish students see as threatening but when the questioning starts president shafik is ready one of the first ones
9:10
she gets is the one that tripped up her colleagues does calling for the genocide of Jews violate Colombia's code of
9:17
conduct Mr Greenwald and she answers unequivocally Dr shafik yes it does and
9:23
Professor that would be a violation of Colombia's rules they would be punished as president of Colombia what is it like
9:29
when you hear chants like by any means necessary or inata revolution I find
9:35
those chants incredibly distressing and I wish profoundly that people would not
9:42
use them on our campus and in some of the most interesting exchanges of the hearing president shaik actually opens
9:48
Colombia's disciplinary books we have already suspended 15 students from
9:53
Colombia we have six on disciplinary probation these are more disciplinary
9:59
actions that have been taken probably in the last decade at Colombia and she talks about the number of students that
10:05
have been suspended but also the number of Faculty that she's had removed from the classroom that are being
10:10
investigated for comments that either violate some of Columbia's rules or make students
10:16
uncomfortable one case in particular really underscores this and that's of a middle eastern studies Professor named
10:22
Joseph mad he wrote an essay not long after Hamas invaded Israel and killed
10:28
1200 people according to the Israeli government where he described that attack with adjectives like awesome now
10:34
he said they've been misinterpreted but a lot of people have taken offense to those comments Miss stonic you're
10:41
recognized for five minutes thank you chairwoman I want to follow up on my colleague rep walberg's question
10:46
regarding Professor Joseph mad so let me be clear uh president and so
10:51
representative Elise stefanic the same Republican who had tripped up claudian gay of Harvard and others in the last
10:57
hearing really digging into president shafik about these things at columia he
11:03
is still chair on the website so has he been terminated as chair congresswoman I
11:09
I and shafi's answers are maybe a little surprising getting back to you I know you confirmed that he was under investigation yes I can confirm that did
11:16
you confirm he was still the chair he says that Columbia is taking his case seriously in fact he's under
11:22
investigation right now well let me ask you this will you make the commitment to remove him as
11:28
chair um and when stefanic presses her to commit to removing him from a campus leadership
11:35
position I think that would be I think I I would yes let me come back with yes
11:41
but I think I I just want to confirm his current status before I write we'll take that as a yes that you will confirm that
11:47
he will no longer be chair shafik seems to kind of pause and think and then
11:52
agree to it on the spot almost like she is making administrative decisions with or in front of Congress now we did some
12:00
reporting after the fact and it turns out the professor didn't even realize he was under investigation so he's learning
12:05
about this from the hearing too so what this all adds up to I think is a performance so in line with what the
12:11
lawmakers themselves wanted to hear that at certain points these Republicans didn't quite know what to do with it
12:17
they were like the dog that caught the car Colombia beats Harvard and youen one
12:24
of them a republican from Florida I think at one point even Marvel well you you beat Harvard and Pen y'all have done
12:31
something that they weren't able to do you've been able to condemn anti-Semitism without using the phrase
12:38
it depends on the context but the so Columbia's president has passed this
12:44
test before this committee yeah this big moment that tripped up her predecessors and cost them their jobs it seems like
12:50
she has cleared that hurdle and dispatched with a congressional committee that could have been one of the biggest threats to her presidency
12:56
without objection there being no further business the committee stands a journ but back on campus some of the
13:03
students and faculty who had been watching the hearing came away with a very different set of
13:08
conclusions they saw a president who was so eager to please republicans in Congress that she was willing to sell
13:15
out some of the University's students and faculty and trample uncherished ideas like academic freedom and freedom
13:22
of expression that have been a Bedrock of American higher education for a really long time MH and there was no
13:29
clear embodiment of that than what had happened that morning just as president
13:34
shafik was going to testify before Congress a group of students Before Dawn
13:39
set up tents in the middle of Colombia's campus and declared themselves a pro
13:45
Palestinian encampment in open Defiance of the very rules that Dr shaik had put
13:51
in place to try and get these protest under control so these students in real
13:56
time are beginning to test some of the things that Columbia's president has just said before Congress exactly and so
14:04
instead of going to celebrate her successful appearance before Congress shaik walks out of the hearing room and
14:09
gets in a black SUV to go right back to that war room where she's immediately confronted with a major dilemma it
14:17
basically boils down to this she had just gone before Congress and told them I'm going to get tough on these protests
14:24
and here they were so either she gets tough and risk inflaming tension on campus
14:30
or she holds back and does nothing and her words before Congress immediately look Hollow H and what does she decide
14:38
so for the next 24 hours she tries to negotiate off-ramps she consults with her Deans and the New York police
14:44
department and it all builds towards an incredibly consequential decision and that is for the first time
14:51
in decades to call the New York City Police Department onto campus in riar
14:57
and break this thing up the students involved and then arrest them to
15:02
essentially eliminate this encampment eliminate the encampment and send a message this is not going to be
15:08
tolerated M but in trying to quell the unrest shafik actually feeds it she ends
15:15
up leaving student protesters and the faculty who support them feeling betrayed and pushes a campus that was
15:21
already on edge into a full-blown crisis [Music]
15:34
after the break what all of this has looked like to a student on Columbia's
15:41
campus we'll be right back
15:48
[Music]
16:00
hello is is this Isabella yes this is she hi Isabella it's it's Michael Barbaro from the
16:08
daily hi nice to meet you earlier this week we called Isabella Ramirez the
16:14
Editor in Chief of Colombia's undergraduate newspaper the Columbia daily spectator which has been closely
16:20
tracking both the protests and the University's response to them since
16:26
October 7th so I mean in in your mind how do we get to
16:32
this point I wonder if you can just briefly describe the the kind of key moments
16:37
that that bring us to where we are right now I mean since October 7th there has
16:43
certainly been constant escalation in terms of tension on campus and there
16:49
have been kind of a variety of moves that I believe have distanced sort of
16:54
the student body The Faculty from the University and its Administration
16:59
specifically the suspension of uh Colombia's chapters of students for justice in Palestine and Jewish voice
17:05
for peace and that became a huge moment in what was sort of characterized as
17:13
suppression of pro Palestinian activism on campus effectively rendering those
17:19
groups quote unquote unauthorized what was the college's explanation for that they had cited in that suspension a
17:27
policy which states that a demonstration must be approved within a certain window
17:34
and that there must be an advanced notice and that there's a process for getting an authorized demonstration but
17:40
the primary point was this policy that they were referring to which we later reported was changed before the
17:48
suspension so it felt a little ad hoc to people yes it certainly came as a
17:54
surprise especially at spectator we're sort of nerds of the the university in
17:59
the sense that we are familiar with faculty and University governance but
18:04
even to us we had no idea where this policy was coming from and and this
18:10
suspension was really the first time that it entered most students sphere got it um you know Columbia's campus is so
18:18
known for its activism and so in my time of of of being a reporter of being an editor I've overseen several protests
18:26
and I've never seen Colombia penalize a group for quotee unquote not authorizing
18:31
a protest so that was certainly in our minds unprecedented and I I believe part of the justification there was well this
18:38
is a different time and I think that is a reasonable thing to say but I think a lot of students they felt it was
18:44
particularly one-sided right that it was targeting a specific type of speech or a specific type of viewpoint although the
18:51
University of course in its explicit policies did not outline and was actually very explicit about not
18:56
targeting specific view points so so just to be super clear it felt to students and it sounds like
19:03
journalistically it felt to you that the University was coming down in a kind of uniquely one-sided way against students
19:12
who were supporting Palestinian rights and may have expressed some frustrations with Israel in that
19:19
moment yes I certainly Isabella says that this was just the beginning of a really tense period between student
19:25
protesters and the university after those two student groups were suspended campus protest continued students made a
19:33
variety of Demands they asked that the university divest from businesses that
19:38
profit from Israel's military operations in Gaza but instead of making any
19:44
progress the protests are met with further Crackdown by the university and
19:49
so as Isabella and her colleagues at the college newspapers see it there's this
19:54
overall chilling effect that occurs some students become fearful that if they participate in any demonstrations
20:01
they're going to face disciplinary action so fast forward now to April when
20:07
these student protesters learned that president shafik is headed to Washington for her Congressional testimony it's at
20:14
this moment that they set out to build their encampment I think there was obviously a
20:22
lot of intention in timing those two things I think it's sort of inherently a critique on
20:29
a political pressure and and this Congressional pressure that we saw build
20:34
up against of course Claud and gay at Harvard and Migel at upen so I think a
20:40
lot of students and faculty have been frustrated at this idea that there are
20:45
there are not only Powers at the University that are dictating what's happening but there are perhaps external
20:51
powers that are also guiding the way here in terms of like what the university feels like it must do or or
20:57
has to do and I think that timing was super crucial having the encampment
21:04
happen on the Wednesday morning of the hearing was an incredible in some senses
21:11
interesting strategy to direct eyes sort of to different places right right um
21:19
all eyes were going to be on shafik in DC but now a lot of eyes are on New York
21:26
the encampment is set up in the middle of the night SL morning um
21:32
prior to the hearing and so what effectively happens is they caught shafik when she wasn't on campus when a
21:39
lot of senior administration had their resources dedicated to supporting Shafi in DC and you have all of those people
21:47
sort of not necessarily out of commission but with their focus elsewhere so the encampment is met with
21:54
very little resistance at the beginning there were sort of Public Safety officers floating around and and sort of
22:00
watching but at the very beginning hours I think there was a sense of we did
22:12
it it would be quite surprising to anybody and administrator to now suddenly see dozens of tents on this
22:19
lawn in a way that I think very purposely puts an imagery of we're here
22:24
to stay as the morning kind of evolved and Congressional hearing
22:31
continued open support then we started seeing
22:38
University delegates that were coming to the encampment saying you know you you may face disciplinary action for
22:43
continuing to be here I think that started around almost like 9 or 10 a.m. they started handing out these code of
22:49
conduct violation [Music]
22:57
notices then there started to be more Public Safety sort of action in presence so they started like barricading the
23:03
entrances the day progressed there was more threat of discipline the students
23:08
became informed that if they continue to stay they will face potential academic sanctions potential
23:16
suspension us louder I think a lot of people were like
23:21
okay you're threatening us with suspension but so what this is about the
23:27
systems that Manu shafik that the Board of Trustees that columia University is
23:34
complicit in what are you going to do to try to get us out of here and that was obviously promptly answered this is
23:44
the unauthorized encampment will be arrested and charged with trespassing my
23:50
phone blew up obviously from from the reporters from the editors of saying oh
23:55
my God the NPD is on our campus and as soon as I saw that I came out and I saw
24:00
a huge crowd of students and Affiliates on campus watching The Lawns and as I
24:07
kind of circled around that crowd I saw the last end of the New York Police
24:13
Department pulling away protesters and kind of clearing out the last of the
24:21
encampment you you we see you we you
24:29
[Music] it was something truly unimaginable over
24:36
a hundred students SL other individuals are arrested from our campus forcefully
24:42
removed and although they were suspended there was a feeling of you know this
24:47
traumatic event that has just happened to these students but also this sense of like okay the worst of the worst that
24:55
could have happened to us just happened and for those students who maybe couldn't go back to into campus now all
25:03
of their peers who were supporters or are in solidarity are in some senses
25:09
further emboldened they're now not just sitting on the Lawns for a prop Palestinian cause but but also for the
25:16
students who have endured quite a lot so the Crackdown sought by the president
25:21
and enforced by the NYPD ends up you're saying becoming a galvanizing Force for a broader group of Colombia students
25:29
then were originally drawn to the idea of ever showing up on the center of
25:35
campus and protesting yeah I can certainly speak to the fact that I've seen my own PE friends or even
25:41
acquaintances who weren't necessarily previously very involved in activism and
25:47
organizing efforts suddenly finding themselves involved can I I just I have
25:52
a question for you which is sure all journalism student journalism
25:59
or not student journalism is a kind of first draft of history and and I wonder if we think of this as a historic moment
26:06
for Colombia how you imagine it's going to be
26:11
remembered yeah there is no doubt in my mind that this will be a historic moment
26:17
for
26:22
Columbia I think that this will be remembered as a moment in which the fractures were la bear really we got to
26:30
see some of the disunity of the community in ways that I have never
26:35
really seen it before and what we'll be looking to is where do we go from here how does Columbia repair how do we heal
26:43
from all of this that is the big question in terms of what will
26:55
happen Nick Isabella Ramirez just walked us through what this has all looked like
27:01
from the perspective of a Columbia student and from what she could tell the Crackdown ordered by President shafik
27:08
did not quell much of anything it seemed instead to really intensify everything on campus I'm curious what this has
27:15
looked like for shafik it's not just the students who are upset you have faculty
27:22
including professors who are not necessarily sympathetic to the protesters view of the war who are
27:28
outraged about what shafik has done here I feel that she's crossed a boundary that hasn't been crossed on Columbia's
27:34
campus in a really long time and so you start to hear things by the end of last week like censure no confidence votes uh
27:42
questions about from her own professors about whether or not she can stay in power so this creates a whole new front
27:49
for her and on top of it all as this is going on the encampment itself starts to reform tent by tent wow almost in the
27:57
same place that it was and shaik decides that the most important thing she could do is to try and take the temperature
28:03
down which means letting the encampment stand or in other words leaning in the
28:09
other direction this time we're going to let the protesters have their say for a little while longer H the problem with
28:15
that is that over the weekend a series of images start to emerge from on campus
28:21
and just off of it of some really troubling anti-semitic episodes in one
28:26
case a guy holds up a poster in the middle of campus and points it towards a group of Jewish students who are
28:32
counter-protest and it says paraphrasing here hamas's next targets I saw an image
28:37
of that I mean what it seemed to evoke was the message that Hamas should murder
28:43
those Jewish students I mean that's the way the Jewish students interpret it right it's a pretty straightforward and
28:49
jarring statement at the same time just outside of Columbia's closed Gates
28:54
killing children protesters are showing up from across New York City it's hard to tell who's affiliated with
29:00
colia who's not back to there's a video that goes
29:07
viral of one of them shouting at Jewish students go back to Poland go back to
29:13
Europe in other words a clear message you're not welcome here right in fact go back to the places where the Holocaust
29:19
was committed exactly and this is not representative of the vast majority of
29:24
the protesters in the encampment who mostly had been peaceful they would later hold a a Seder actually with some
29:30
of the pro Palestinian Jewish protesters in their ranks but those videos are reaching members of Congress the very
29:37
same Republicans that shafik had testified in front of just a few days before and now they're looking and
29:44
saying you have lost control of your campus you've turned back on your word to us and you need to resign they call
29:51
for her outright resignation over this that's right Republicans in New York and across the country begin to call for her
29:59
to step down from her position as president of colia so shafi's dilemma here is pretty extraordinary she has set
30:06
up this Dynamic where pleasing these members of Congress would probably mean
30:11
calling in the NYPD all over again to sweep out this encampment which would mean further alienating and inflaming
30:20
students and faculty who are still very upset over the first Crackdown and now
30:25
both ends of this spectrum lawmakers in Washington folks on the Columbia campus
30:32
are saying she can't lead the university over this situation before she's even
30:38
made any fateful decision about what to do with this second encampment not a good situation no she's besieged on all
30:45
sides for a while the only thing that she can come up with to offer is for classes to go hybrid for the remainder
30:51
of the semester so students who aren't feeling safe in this protest environment
30:57
don't necessarily have to go class right and I think if we zoom out for a second it's it's worth bearing in mind that she
31:02
tried to choose a different path here right than her counterparts at Harvard or Penn and after all of this she's kind
31:09
of ended up in the exact same Thicket with people calling for her job with the White House the mayor of New York City
31:16
and other these These are Democrats uh maybe not calling on her to resign quite yet but saying I don't know what's going
31:22
on on your campus uh this does not look good I mean that reality that taking a
31:28
different tack That was supposed to be full of learnings and lessons from the stumbles of her peers the fact that that
31:34
didn't really work suggests that there's something really intractable going on here and I wonder how you're thinking
31:43
about this intractable situation that's now arrived on these college
31:49
campuses well I don't think it's just limited to college campuses right we have seen intense feelings about this
31:55
conflict play out in Hollywood we've seen them in our politics in all kinds of interesting ways in our media we've
32:02
seen it in the media but college campuses at least in their most idealized form are something special
32:08
they're a place where students get to go for four years to think in big ways about moral questions and political
32:15
questions and ideas that help shape the world they're going to spend the rest of their lives in and so when you have a
32:20
question that feels as urgent as this war does for a lot of people I think it reverberates in an incredibly intense
32:27
way on those campuses and there's something like I don't know if it's quite a contradiction of terms but
32:33
there's a collision of different values at stake so universities thrive on the
32:39
ability of students to follow their minds and their voices where they go to to maybe even experiment a little bit
32:44
and find those things but there are also communities that rely on people being able to trust each other and being able
32:50
to carry out their classes and their academic Endeavors as a collective so they can learn from one another so in
32:57
this this case that's all kind of getting scrambled students who feel strongly about the Palestinian cause
33:04
feel like the point is disruption that something so big and immediate and Urgent is happening that they need to
33:10
get in the faces of their professors and their administrators and their fellow students right and set up an encampment in the middle of Campus no matter what
33:16
the will say right and from the administration's perspective they say well yeah you can say that and you can
33:21
think that and that's an important process but maybe there's some bad apples in your ranks or though you may
33:26
have good intentions you're saying things that you don't realize the implications of and they're making this environment unsafe for others or they're
33:33
grinding our classes to a halt and we're not able to function as a university so the only way we're going to be able to
33:38
move forward is if you will respect our rules and we'll respect your point of view the problem is that's just not
33:45
happening something is not connecting with those two points of view and as if that's not hard enough you then have
33:52
Congress and the political system with its own agenda coming in and putting its thumb on a scale of an already very
33:59
difficult situation right and at this very moment what we know is that the forces that you just outlined have
34:06
created a dilemma an uncertainty of how to proceed not just for president shafik
34:15
and the students and faculty at Colombia but for a growing number of colleges and
34:20
universities across the country and by that I mean this thing that seemed to
34:26
start at Columbia is literally spreading absolutely we're talking on a Wednesday
34:32
afternoon and these encampments have now started cropping up at universities from coast to coast at Harvard and Yale but
34:39
also at University of California at the University of Texas at smaller campuses
34:44
in between and at each of these institutions there's presidents and Deans just like president shafik at
34:51
Columbia who are facing a really difficult set of choices do they call in the police the University of Texas and
34:57
Austin this afternoon we saw protesters physically clashing with police right do they hold back like at Harvard where
35:03
there were dramatic videos of students literally running into Harvard Yard with tents they were popping up in real time
35:09
and so Colombia really I think at the end of the day may have kicked off some of this but they are now in League with
35:16
a whole bunch of other universities that are struggling with the same set of questions it's a set of questions that
35:22
they've had since this war broke out and now these schools only have a week or two left to classes but we don't know
35:29
when these standoffs are going to end we don't know if students are going to leave campus for the summer we don't know if they're going to come back in
35:34
the fall and start protesting right away or if this year is going to turn out to have been an aberration that was a
35:41
response to a really awful bloody war or if we're at the beginning of a bigger shift on college campuses that will long
35:48
Outlast this war in the Middle East well Nick thank you very much
35:55
thanks for having me Michael
36:03
we'll be right [Music]
36:12

36:17

36:23
forces withdrew from hospitals in Gaza a officials in Gaza said that some of the
36:30
bodies found in the graves were Palestinians who had been handcuffed or shot in the head and accused Israel of
36:38
killing and burying them in response Israel said that it soldiers had exuded
36:45
bodies in one of the graves as part of an effort to locate Israeli
36:51
hostages and on Wednesday Hamas released a video of hssh gold B Poland an Israeli
