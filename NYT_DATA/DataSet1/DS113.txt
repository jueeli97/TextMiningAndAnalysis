El Salvador Decimated Gangs. But at What Cost?



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
tavernes and this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:10
daily El Salvador has experienced a
0:13
remarkable transformation what had been
0:16
one of the most violent countries in the
0:18
world has become incredibly safe today
0:22
my colleague Natalie kroof on the cost
0:25
of that transformation to the people of
0:27
El Salvador and the man at the center of
0:30
it president naib buele who claimed
0:33
victory in an election on
0:35
[Music]
0:37
Sunday it's Wednesday February
0:41
[Music]
0:44
7th Natalie hi hi Sabrina it's nice to
Reporting on El Salvador
0:48
have you back on the show as a guest and
0:51
not a host it's great to be here so
0:53
Natalie you've spent the past few months
0:55
reporting on El Salvador tell us what
0:58
you've been finding in your reporting
1:00
yeah so I've been really interested in
1:02
El Salvador since I became the bureau
1:04
chief in Mexico City I mean this is this
1:08
tiny country the smallest country in
1:10
Central America that now has this broad
1:13
resonance across the region because it
1:16
has undergone a remarkable
1:18
transformation in the last few years now
1:21
to really understand the magnitude of
1:23
this change of what's happened you have
1:25
to remember that El Salvador was long
1:27
known as one of the world's most violent
1:36
countries government troops in El
1:38
Salvador nowhere in the world today is
1:41
there a fiercer bloodier battle for
1:43
control of a Nation this is violence
1:45
that traces itself back to this bloody
1:48
Civil War that the country fought it
1:50
ended in
1:51
1992 it sent hundreds of thousands of
1:54
Salvadorans fleeing to the United States
1:57
where they developed these street gangs
1:59
in Salvador they fight against each
2:01
other but in Los Angeles they stand side
2:03
by side on street corners hoping to find
2:05
a day's work you know the MS13 gang the
2:08
18th Street gang this government video
2:10
shows some of the arrestes getting on a
2:12
plane being deported and when the US
2:15
started deporting Salvadorans back home
2:18
in this case back to El Salvador and
2:21
leaving the plane free of handcuffs and
2:23
leg chains they brought the gangs with
2:26
them and they grew them these gangs you
2:29
know they started dominate vast swaths
2:31
of the country and they really divided
2:33
the country up into their own thiefs and
2:36
they ruled over their Turf with extreme
2:39
violence I mean the level of brutality
2:42
that people were subjected to was just
2:45
remarkable the Central American nation
2:47
of El Salvador has seen a terrifying
2:49
search in violence this year and they
2:51
kind of created these invisible borders
2:54
across the country I mean if you lived
2:56
in a neighborhood controlled by one gang
2:59
you could not cross in to a neighborhood
3:01
controlled by the rival gang even if you
3:03
had no gang affiliation because doing so
3:06
could get you killed wow and people I
3:08
talked to in El Salvador said they
3:10
couldn't go to the police the police
3:12
were seen as untrustworthy in some cases
3:14
corrupt if you went to the police people
3:17
told me the police would point you out
3:18
to the gang and that could get you
3:20
killed so for many Salvadorans they
3:22
really felt they had absolutely no
3:26
[Music]
3:28
recourse
3:31
[Music]
How did we get here
3:35
but now in the past two years you've
3:37
seen this Total Transformation of the
3:41
country and the gangs that used to
3:44
dominate have been decimated so it's
3:47
open Warfare among the gangs and this is
3:50
misery for the population of El Salvador
3:52
and now you're seeing this remarkable
3:55
transformation as you just told me how
3:57
did we get here from
4:00
there well a lot of it comes down to
4:03
this one
4:04
[Applause]
4:07
guy naib
4:10
[Applause]
4:14
[Music]
4:17
bu he's an unlikely kind of political
4:21
phenomenon he's the descendant of a
4:23
family of Palestinian migrants he grew
4:25
up in an upper middle- class
4:27
neighborhood he was educated at an elite
4:29
Bilingual School he started out as a
4:32
publicist on political campaigns and
4:35
really gets his start
4:39
so you know at the age of 30 when he
4:42
becomes mayor of a small town but his
4:45
rise is
4:50
meteoric he soon becomes mayor of the
4:53
capital San Salvador he's this you know
4:55
backwards hat wearing digital guy I mean
4:59
he understands social media he
5:02
understands marketing he is able to sell
5:04
himself super effectively and in 2018 he
5:08
decides to run for president and he
5:11
really builds himself as this change
5:14
candidate
5:17
the you know he is going to break with
5:20
the corrupt politics of the past bu
5:23
capitalized on disenchantment with the
5:25
country's two main parties which have
5:27
been in power for nearly three decades
5:29
and one of his key promises is he's
5:31
going to address the crime
5:36
[Music]
5:38
problem and in 2019 he's elected by a
5:42
pretty significant
5:47
margin so what does he do once he gets
What does he do
5:50
into office so one of the first things
5:52
we hear about on buuk Kell's crime
5:53
strategy is that Salvadoran media
5:55
reports that his government is actually
5:58
negotiating with gang leaders in prison
6:01
and this is later confirmed by us
6:04
officials they say that buell's
6:06
Administration negotiated with gang
6:08
leaders in prison for a reduction in
6:11
homicides in exchange for prison
6:13
benefits and other Financial incentives
6:15
now murders go down and and that
6:18
actually you know helps his popularity
6:21
which is Skyhigh at this point and he
6:25
starts to consolidate power his party
6:28
wins a super majority in 2021 in the
6:31
legislative assembly and that allows
6:33
them to make pretty radical changes they
6:35
dismiss top Supreme Court judges they
6:38
dismiss the attorney general who was
6:40
investigating his government for
6:42
corruption it gives Buel a lot of
6:45
control over the country and is this
6:47
because he was able to make this deal
6:49
with the gangs like kind of buying them
6:51
off in a way well that's what the local
6:53
media and the US government says I mean
6:55
he denies the charge that he negotiated
6:58
with the gangs but it's very clear that
7:01
the security situation which has calmed
7:03
down at this point is a big part of his
7:06
appeal but that calm is broken in March
7:11
of 2022 when there is an explosion of
7:14
gang violence over one weekend 62
7:16
homicides on Saturday the most in one
7:19
single day in more than 20 years The
7:22
Gangs just went on a killing spree some
7:25
theorize that maybe this PCT that he
7:28
allegedly came to with the gangs you
7:30
know broke apart but in any case the
7:34
result is that his administration
7:37
responds with
7:40
Force what do they do they impose a
7:44
state of emergency and this is a really
7:47
extreme situation an increased Army
7:50
presence on the streets in El Salvador
7:52
an iMed the government send soldiers
7:54
onto the streets and launch a campaign
7:57
of mass arrests the president president
7:59
and Congress passing a temporary move to
8:02
impose restrictions on assembly extend
8:05
police detentions and allow The
8:07
Intercept of communications like phone
8:09
calls the government suspends key
8:11
constitutional rights indefinitely they
8:13
say they've arrested over 6,000
8:16
suspected gang members tracking them in
8:18
neighborhoods inside homes and even
8:22
hiding underground thousands and
8:24
thousands of people who are put behind
8:26
bars with no due
8:28
process the National Police touting the
8:31
efforts on social media all week using
8:33
the hash war against
8:37
[Music]
8:40
gangs and as you can imagine this really
The Hash War
8:45
quickly transforms El Salvador it
8:48
transforms El Salvador into what sounds
8:50
like a police state what did that feel
8:52
like for people in El Salvador so I've
8:55
gone to El Salvador several times over
8:57
the last two years to try to to
8:59
understand that question
9:02
Sabrina and in my most recent trip in
9:05
January I met this family that really
9:08
encapsulates the
9:10
complexity baked into how people feel
9:13
about
9:20
this I met them at their home this
9:22
modest house three rooms just outside of
9:25
San
9:28
Salvador
9:33
and sat down there with Irma who's
9:36
56 and her husband Mario and they have
9:39
two
9:40
[Music]
9:48
sons okay Irma has lived in El Salvador
9:51
her whole life she makes and sells corn
9:54
tortillas for a living and she really
9:57
lived through the world worst of this
9:59
country's
10:04
violence she says the community where
10:06
she lived which was gang controlled was
10:09
just a
10:17
nightmare she says gang members would
10:20
you know enter her home without asking
10:22
for permission when they were
10:24
hiding you know they would run on top of
10:27
the roofs she show her room which is
10:30
next to the window she said she was
10:31
afraid that bullets would come
10:37
in but even with all of that what
10:40
weighed on her the most is that she said
10:42
it was too dangerous for her to go visit
10:44
her mom because her mom lived in a
10:47
neighborhood controlled by a rival
10:50
gang and so when bu enters the
10:58
scene she says she has a lot of hope she
11:01
voted for
11:06
him and when the state of emergency gets
11:10
announced she said she noticed her
11:12
community just radically
11:22
Chang and things got better really
11:25
quickly but then a month later this
11:29
on the gangs really comes to her
Marios Arrest
11:37
[Music]
11:41
doorstep her son Mario who's 26 had come
11:45
over to help her wash the corn and
11:47
prepare the dough that she needs to sell
11:49
her
11:52
tortillas and he tells her that he's
11:54
going to go get a haircut because he's
11:56
looking kind of Shaggy and he has work
11:58
the next day
12:01
and and a few hours later her husband
12:05
gets a call from Mario saying that he's
12:07
been
12:08
arrested and so her husband rushes to
12:11
the
12:15
scene he asks the police for answers he
12:17
begs for answers why is my son being
12:19
taken away what is going on the police
12:22
brush him off and brush him off and then
12:24
they directly tell
12:26
him look stop asking questions or else
12:29
we're going to detain you too and was
12:32
there a chance he was in fact a gang
12:39
member well IR is adamant that no he's
12:42
not involved with the
12:47
gangs she showed me documents showing
12:50
that he worked at a call center that he
12:51
had no criminal record but at the time
12:54
and remember these were Mass arrests and
12:56
there was no due process this is is the
12:59
other prong of buell's security strategy
13:01
which is that there is a suspension of
13:04
constitutional rights human rights
13:07
groups say that there were thousands of
13:10
people who were not gang members who
13:12
were still thrown Behind Bars and that's
13:14
of more than 75,000 who have been
13:16
arrested during the state of emergency
13:19
there have been reports that prisoners
13:20
have been tortured and deprived of food
13:21
inside prisons and you know really what
13:24
happens is that you get arrested you
13:27
disappear into the prison system
13:29
and you're never really heard from again
13:31
I mean this is the case for Irma and her
13:37
family for almost 2 years they have not
Marios Family
13:41
heard from or seen Mario they have no
13:45
idea how he's doing and that includes
13:48
his 8-year-old son who asks about Mario
13:50
all the time and misses him a
13:56
lot it's been a huge wound for the
14:11
family her son's house is just like a
14:15
few houses down from
14:18
hers and we went there and looked at it
14:21
and it's like this time capsule they've
14:23
barely touched it since he was taken
14:26
away we're here in Mario's
14:29
room where he has drawings by his son of
14:33
a coffee mug and a blue blob and a
14:38
submarine it's all dusty I mean she says
14:41
she can't even go
14:43
there you
14:52
know and while we were there she just
14:56
broke
14:57
down
14:59
[Music]
15:06
and Natalie what does she say about buk
15:10
I mean she voted for him right well
15:12
that's a thing this whole time you know
15:14
I've wondering what does she think about
15:17
the president who in many ways is
15:19
responsible for her son's arrest and the
15:22
thing
15:25
is she doesn't blame him
15:38
in fact she says she supports everything
15:40
the president
15:43
[Music]
15:52
does we'll be right
15:57
back
Natalie
16:00
so Natalie help me understand this here
16:02
she's still supportive of buou despite
16:05
the fact that she has lost her son whom
16:08
she says is innocent yeah I think Irma
16:11
represents how a lot of Salvadorans feel
16:14
I've heard this sentiment a lot in my
16:17
trips to the country and the way she
16:20
explains it is that first of all she
16:22
kind of takes it out of bu's
16:27
hands
16:33
mhm she says look what bu said was to go
16:37
after guilty people he wasn't the one
16:39
actually making the arrests you know
16:42
there were other people on the ground
16:43
doing this and if mistakes were made by
16:45
them well those were mistakes that they
16:47
made not Buel it's not his fault it kind
16:50
of reminds me Natalie of Russia and the
16:52
way Russians see Putin that he's
16:54
floating above it all he knows best you
16:57
know it's just his kind of corrupt
16:59
minions who were bungling the job when
17:01
they carry it out yeah she has absolute
17:05
faith in buell's intentions and in what
17:08
he wanted to
17:09
[Music]
17:10
do and that kind of explains the other
Irma
17:13
piece of this for
17:18
Irma she's a very religious person and
17:21
she sees all of this as part of God's
17:24
plan for her I mean she sees herself as
17:28
suffering the consequences of a broader
17:32
direction for the country that is
17:35
overall
17:47
good I mean she basically refers to
17:51
herself as collateral damage to this
17:54
bigger kind of change in the country and
17:59
that change is one she really supports
18:02
and so this thing that happened with her
18:04
son is causing her a lot of pain but it
18:07
doesn't make her question the bigger
18:09
purpose of it
18:26
all wow that is extraordinary I mean
El Salvador
18:29
she's choosing her community above
18:32
herself and it's probably also a measure
18:35
of the sheer desperation that
18:38
Salvadorans had to escape Lawless
18:41
violence right that state of being that
18:44
was so painful for them for so many
18:46
years absolutely this is a population
18:51
that was living under extreme violence
18:55
for years and years and years and to now
18:58
have that removed from the picture I
19:01
mean for many people that's worth the
19:05
price of unjust arrests or of having the
19:09
military on the streets and when you
19:11
look at what bukele has done it really
19:13
goes Way Beyond the state of
19:18
emergency his party replaced Supreme
19:21
Court judges who then reinterpreted the
19:24
country's Constitution to allow him to
19:27
run for real
19:29
election legal Scholars say this is
19:32
explicitly banned in the Constitution
19:35
but he did it anyway and so people
19:38
inside the country and outside are
19:40
looking at what bu's doing and saying
19:43
this is chipping away at the foundations
19:46
of
19:47
democracy they're wondering how
19:49
Democratic is the country
19:55
anymore but when you ask people who
Felix Felix Ooa
19:58
lived in communities that were really
20:01
kind of War zones in the past they sound
20:04
a lot like Irma and what was Bill's
20:07
response to the accusations that he
20:09
might be tugging the country away from
20:10
democracy that the system of democracy
20:12
in El Salvador was in danger under
20:15
him well right after I talked to
20:21
Irma I went to the residence of the vice
20:24
president Felix Felix Ooa he's a
20:28
22-year-old politician he's someone
20:30
who's been in this world for a long time
20:33
and I wanted to ask him about these
20:36
criticisms and we sat down and the first
20:39
thing we talked about were cases like
20:45
IRAs how the government justifies
20:48
sweeping up so many people that are not
20:52
gang
20:56
members what said was we're in a war and
21:01
in a war there's collateral
21:07
damage there is a margin of error so
21:10
he's acknowledging that mistakes have
21:13
been made essentially but saying this is
21:16
the price of something that is changing
21:19
the
21:26
country and he's saying look the
21:28
innocent people will eventually be
21:29
released the government has released
21:32
7,000 people from jails but human rights
21:34
groups say thousands more remain Behind
21:37
Bars and are not gang members and when I
21:40
asked him about the charge that his
21:42
government was undermining
21:45
democracy he told me something pretty
21:50
remarkable what he said was what
21:53
democracy
21:57
huh
22:01
what democracy did we have in this
22:03
country that left us with tens of
22:06
thousands of dead that just serve to
22:09
benefit corrupt politicians that's the
22:11
Democracy you're so concerned
22:19
about he said to the people that say
22:23
that we are dismantling
22:25
democracy I say yes
22:37
we're not dismantling it he said we are
22:40
eliminating it he said the system that
22:43
existed before was rotten corrupt and
22:56
bloody
22:58
New York Times and buk was asked about
23:01
these comments in a news conference on
23:03
Sunday shortly before he claimed a
23:05
resounding victory in the election the
23:08
votes are still being counted but his
23:10
win looked decisive and he
23:19
said we're not eliminating democracy
23:22
because El Salvador has never had
23:26
democracy
23:30
he said this is the first time the
23:32
country has ever had democracy okay
23:35
which is not actually true because
23:36
obviously they've had elections so
23:38
what's he talking about like what does
23:39
he mean there I think it really comes
23:41
down to how this government defines
23:44
democracy you know critics point out
23:46
that there are really no checks on his
23:48
power nothing stopping him from doing
23:51
whatever he wants in the country but he
23:54
says look this is the will of the people
23:57
we have popular support we won
23:59
reelection and when you ask people on
24:01
the streets people will say look these
24:04
are the results we have been craving
24:06
this security situation for us is
24:10
priceless and it's not just in El
24:12
Salvador that he has this appeal bukel
24:14
has become a model across the region a
24:17
reference point you have politicians in
24:19
Honduras the Dominican Republic Ecuador
24:22
Colombia folks promising to emulate his
24:25
model and in some case putting pieces of
24:27
it to work in their own countries which
24:29
makes me wonder Natalie how is El
24:32
Salvador being seen by the us right now
24:35
I mean I imagine you know one fewer
24:37
democracy in its backyard is probably
24:39
not a great thing is the Biden
24:41
Administration talking about this I mean
24:43
in the beginning of Bull's term the
24:45
Biden Administration was very vocal
24:47
pushing back on some of what we're
24:49
seeing as attacks on Democracy but over
24:52
the last year or so not so much part of
24:54
the issue here is that the security
24:57
situation analysts say has contributed
25:00
to a real drop in illegal migration from
25:03
El Salvador which is something that the
25:05
Biden Administration cares about a lot
25:08
right you have fewer Salvadorans going
25:10
to the US border that's a factor and I
25:13
think there's a broader understanding
25:15
that look people are voting for this so
25:19
what is it going to look like if we
25:20
start criticizing it from the outside
25:23
mean at the same time there are people
25:25
former officials who are telling me we
25:27
are enabling a one-man authoritarian
25:31
state to develop in this
25:36
region and this leads to the broader
The broader point
25:38
point right which is you know it's true
25:40
that people did vote for him he is
25:43
popularly elected people are choosing
25:45
him because they're so glad to feel safe
25:48
even if they're living in a police state
25:50
but I guess the question is what happens
25:52
when they have a different thing they
25:55
want to solve for at The Ballot Box well
25:57
well yeah I mean that's a really big
25:59
question Sabrina and I don't think
26:01
anybody knows the answer but the fear
26:03
especially among critics of buele is
26:05
that by the time that people become
26:08
satisfied with safety and then maybe
26:11
have some dissatisfactions with other
26:13
things what happens when people start to
26:16
get frustrated with the lack of job
26:19
opportunities or maybe they grow tired
26:21
of a situation in which all these people
26:23
are being arrested or maybe they grow
26:25
tired of the military being on the
26:27
streets
26:28
the fear is by that point there won't be
26:31
any avenues for real descent how will
26:35
people really be able to exercise their
26:37
opposition to a government that maybe
26:40
they're not so happy with right it'll be
26:43
too late that's the
26:47
[Music]
26:49
fear Natalie thank you thanks
26:56
Sabrina
27:03
we'll be right
27:08
back here's what else you should know
27:10
today on Tuesday on this vote the Y's
27:14
are 214 and the Nays are 216 the
27:18
resolution is not
27:20
adopted in a stunning defeat for House
27:22
Republicans and their leader speaker
27:24
Mike Johnson the chamber rejected imp
27:27
impeachment charges against Alejandro
27:29
mayorcas the homeland security secretary
27:32
the vote failed after a small group of
27:34
Republicans broke with their party and
27:37
refused to support what amounted to a
27:39
partisan indictment of President Biden's
27:41
immigration policies the rejection was
27:44
especially embarrassing for Johnson who
27:46
had expressed confidence that it would
27:47
pass and because Republicans had been
27:50
promising the impeachment for more than
27:51
a
27:53
year and a federal appeals court
27:56
rejected Donald Trump's claim of
27:58
immunity in the case of his attempts to
28:00
overturn the 2020 election a three-judge
28:04
panel in the US court of appeals for the
28:06
District of Columbia circuit ruled
28:08
unanimously that Trump must go on trial
28:11
marking an important moment in American
28:13
Juris Prudence as the first time an
28:16
appeals court had ever answered the
28:18
question of whether former presidents
28:20
can escape being held criminally
28:22
accountable for things they did in
28:26
office
