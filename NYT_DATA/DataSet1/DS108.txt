The Biden Problem Democrats Can No Longer Ignore



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Michael aaro this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:12
daily for months Democrats have downplayed questions about President
0:17
Biden's age and his memory that just got much harder to
0:25
do my colleague Peter Baker explains
0:30
[Music]
0:36
[Applause]
0:42
it's Wednesday February [Music]
0:50
14th Peter when the Special counsil Report was released a few days ago and ignited into a national conversation
0:57
about President Biden's age and memory all of us here at the daily thought of you because you've covered Biden for
1:04
decades now you've seen him up close as a senator as vice president now president you've watched him age and in
1:11
your role as chief White House correspondent you've been examining what it means for Biden to be the oldest
1:18
president in American history so I just want to start there with your own observations well yeah the reality is
1:25
that Joe Biden has age and it's hard not to notice and I think over the past few years that aging has been a a pronounced
1:32
process there's a real change occurring not surprising it's normal for somebody of his age in many ways obviously he's
1:39
as healthy and vigorous as any 81y old you can see he rides bikes he exercises but it's hard not to notice when you
1:46
watch him up close well just explain what you mean when you talk about this aging like you said everyone ages but
1:53
let's talk about the specifics of Biden aging here well there's the Public
1:58
Presentation right what you you see when he shows up in the East room for instance or the podium you see it in his
2:04
gate first thing out right he's walking to the podium and he kind of shuffles now into rooms and he has taken a few
2:12
Falls recently you know he once fell on his bike and that was recorded by cameras which was embarrassing to him so
2:18
that's the visual element that's what we see and then you know there's also the verbal element they had to work hard to
2:25
show patience and be willing to travel over a thousand miles you could say even
2:31
this harder than getting a a ticket to the Renaissance tour or or
2:36
or rip pitney's tour she's down in it's kind of warm in Brazil right now you can
2:43
hear him in his extemporaneous speaking sometimes Trail off mids sentence with
2:49
40% of all products coming into the United States of America on the west coast go through uh Los Angeles and uh
2:57
and uh um uh um what am I doing here is it Long Beach Long Beach thank you or you know
3:04
struggling to find his way back there is some movement and I don't want to I
3:09
don't want to well maybe choose my words there's
3:15
some movement there's been a response
3:20
from the uh the there's been a response again
3:28
that's not unusual for somebody of his age but it comes across more pronounced when you're president the United States
3:33
and the cameras are on you so intensely right and I think what really stands out for a lot of people particularly lately
3:40
has been his memory you know he will confuse people for instance mentioning
3:47
helmet Cole when he means Angela Merkel different chancellors of Germany helmet Cole of course been dead for a number of
3:52
years same with France he confused Fran midan the late president of France with
3:59
Emanuel mcon the current president of France in my reporting even talking with
4:04
people about private Ms with the president what's striking is like Administration officials for instance
4:10
who haven't seen him in a while or former AIDS who are catching up with them after a number of months what
4:15
they'll say is how surprised they are at how much he is aged they too notice it
4:21
when they haven't seen him for a while and it's been striking to them so it's not just even what the reporters are
4:27
seeing but the people who are around them Peter I'm curious in your reporting
4:32
how you're separating what might be kind of superficial about what for example
4:40
these former AIDS are telling you or what we all see you know the president forgetting a foreign Leader's name
4:45
mistaking it how you separate potentially a common variety of someone
4:51
getting old and having a lapse from what's truly worrisome about this as a
4:57
journalist yeah I mean that that's a fair question and what we've tried to do is do a lot of reporting to distinguish
5:04
between the two right between The Superficial does it really matter if he gets the name wrong here or there and is
5:10
his judgment affected is his ability to process information and make important decisions affected and that's that's
5:16
what really of course matters most in a president a commander-in-chief especially at a time when we have so many crises and so a few months ago
5:24
right a team of us at the time spent weeks talking to dozens of people around Biden and and we found is basically
5:30
there are sort of these two bidens coexisting side by side there's the one who does forget names and places and may
5:35
Trail off in the middle of the thought but then there's a Biden that behaves the way you would expect a president to
5:41
act you know to really Grill his Aids on what's going on and make sure he has all the information in fact to correct them
5:47
when he thinks that they're wrong to make crisp decisions when they are necessary to make wise decisions in the
5:54
face of these enormous challenges and crises that a president can face and so
5:59
there's one story for instance about the president being on a trip to to Asia a number of months back and being woken in
6:06
the middle of the night to find out that a missile had struck Poland which of course is a NATO Ally of America and
6:12
this is a real crisis because the fear was that Russia in its war with Ukraine
6:18
had hit a NATO Ally which would have been a massive escalation right I remember it right and in the middle of
6:24
the night he's woken up to deal with this crisis and as his a describe it and of course this his a were not there but
6:30
as they describe it you know he does what you want a president to do he gets in touch with the president of Poland and the NATO Secretary General and he
6:37
really leads the world through this crisis and as they discover fortunately it turned out not to be a Russian
6:42
missile it was not an intentional escalation and the crisis was diffused but that's the two bidens you're seeing
6:48
the one that you don't see as much on TV or in public who is doing the job that
6:54
the voters want them to do right the conclusion you and our colleagues seem to have drawn and correct my wrong is
6:59
that even if Biden's memory and his verbal agility is in any kind of decline
7:06
in the moments that matter the president functions highly and in those moments of
7:11
functioning highly most of them are off camera yeah that's right look I in interviewing all these people who have
7:17
been around them AIDS Administration officials allies Congressional officials
7:23
even foreign diplomats nobody has said to me they don't think he can do the job nobody said that they think that the
7:29
issues that trouble a lot of Americans about his appearance or you know his clear aging have affected his capacity
7:37
to make the decisions that you would want a president to make now what a lot of people do con have concern about
7:42
including some people around him is you know where this could lead if he's able to make these decisions in the way he
7:48
does now that's one thing what will it be like a year from now or if he RNs another election 5 years from now he
7:55
would be 86 at the end of a second term and that's that's the question I think a lot of V are going to ask right so even
8:01
those around him who are quick to tell you there's no problem with President Biden's ability to function of his job
8:08
period say but if you're asking us what will it look like in four years and a
8:14
second term there's some pause there at least among some of them right there are
8:19
a lot of people in the administration who will in a you know candid moment maybe over a glass of wine at night or
8:25
when they're certainly not on the record then you would hear from some Administration officials anyway this
8:30
concern about what things may be like in a year or especially five years and they
8:36
understand just like a lot of Americans do that that a lot can happen between now and then but at the same time of
8:42
course it's a binary Choice the other candidate here is not exactly a younger generation that's Donald Trump he's 77
8:49
and he has his own public memory lapses and confusion over issues and names have
8:56
weaponized law enforcement to arrest their leading political opponent and leading by a lot including Obama I'll
9:03
tell you what you take a look at Obama and take a look at some of the things that he's done this is the same thing
9:08
the country is very divided and we did with Obama we won an election that
9:14
everyone said couldn't be one and all kinds of other you know uh things he says that seem to indicate cognitive
9:21
issues with age we have a man who is totally corrupt and the worst president
9:26
in the history of our country who is cognitively impaired in no condition to
9:32
lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war
9:39
just think of it we would be in World War
9:45
II difference is of course that Trump speaks with such bombastic energy that
9:50
it sort of conveys something different and the polls show that while a lot of Americans are also concerned about
9:56
Trump's age and he also would be the oldest president in history if he wins and finishes a four-year term not as
10:02
many voters are quite as concerned as they are with Biden that the age issue has definitely been more damaging
10:09
politically for Biden so far than it has been for Trump right so fairly or
10:14
unfairly and I'm sure to those in Biden world it's unfair the reality is that the age issue
10:20
Cuts both ways but it seems to bruise Biden more right so I think it's fair to
10:26
say that is the complicated backdrop against which the special counsel report
10:33
is released exactly so Robert Herr was the special Council appointed by attorney general Merrick Garland to look
10:40
into why President Biden had kept classified documents from his time as vice president even going back to his
10:46
time as Senate and these documents were found in his office and Home in Wilmington Delaware that's not where
10:52
they're supposed to be right and of course president Trump since he had already been investigated for something
10:57
similar they had to make sure to look at this in a serious way as well so Robert
11:02
her was a republican us attorney appointed by Trump and then picked by
11:08
Merck Garland to handle this very delicate case because that way you know nobody could say that if he uh found no
11:15
issue that he was a partisan Democrat in fact he has a pretty nonpartisan reputation and he spent a long time like
11:22
about a year looking into this and he decides that there is not a crime here to charge President Biden with which is
11:27
obviously a big to the president but this legal exoneration is unfortunately
11:34
for Biden a political nightmare the bombshell in the report is why Robert H
11:41
says he can't charge the president and one of the reasons he says the president's memory is so bad that he
11:47
couldn't establish Biden's intent to willfully retain the documents or why
11:52
these documents were stored the way that they were MH which is an extraordinary claim I mean to some it was inflam Ator
12:00
how does the special Council how does her justify coming to that conclusion that
12:07
the reason or a big reason he can't charge Biden is because the president's memory is so faulty right exactly so her
12:16
sits down with President Biden for five hours of interviews over two days and in
12:21
his report her ticks through these key moments when the president can't seem to remember important moments or at least
12:27
remember the specifics of when they happened for instance he said he couldn't remember reading out loud his
12:35
notes to the ghost writer of one of his books although obviously he did do that and in Reading those out read Out
12:41
classified information he couldn't remember exactly when he was vice president at one point he says if it was
12:47
2013 when did I stop being vice president he was trying to recall in 2009 am I still vice president so he
12:54
couldn't place the dates correctly at least not initially and according to Robert Herr even most explosively
13:02
President Biden couldn't remember the year that his son Bo died even within several years and I think that in
13:09
particular was a powerful thing for Robert herd to report so in the end her
13:15
writes in his report quote a jury would not convict him because he seems like a
13:21
well-meaning elderly man with memory problems right I think a lot of people
13:26
who saw that language Peter thought does this special Council have it in for Joe
13:34
Biden I mean you described him as nonpartisan but this is a very official
13:39
legal document and the conclusions and the language that he arrives at are
13:46
pointed and seemingly embarrassing and in the context of a campaign pretty
13:52
damaging and so the thinking becomes is there a backstory here we need to
13:58
understand right yeah that's a fair question and after all the special counsil was tasked with looking into mishandling classified
14:05
documents not the president's mental acuity but you know for Robert Herr he felt the need to justify his decision
14:12
not to bring criminal charges and so the examples needed I suppose in his mind to
14:18
be as revealing and telling as they were in order to explain the conclusion that he made right because whatever this
14:25
issue was before this report was released Biden his age his memory all those
14:31
questions it was suddenly on steroids it was suddenly something really hard to
14:39
not look at and talk about and think about absolutely this is not a poll this
14:45
is not a reporter writing a story it's not a columnist or a commentator making gratuitous comments it's not Republicans
14:51
you know chopping up his videos and and putting them out in a damaging way this is an official report and is saying that
14:59
a a conclusion about whether or not to charge president United States has been based on his ability to remember things
15:06
or not remember things as the case may be and the line then becomes well if he's not fit to be a defendant in a
15:12
trial is he fit to be president of the United States and you can imagine how this goes over in the white house right
15:18
this is infuriating to them Biden land is absolutely livid the president is
15:26
absolutely livid and so he decides to fight
15:31
[Music]
15:37
back we'll be right [Music]
15:49
back so Peter how does President Biden end up fighting back against this special Council report that turns out to
15:57
be so embarrassing for him well on Thursday night just a few hours after the report comes out and without any
16:03
real notice to the White House Press Corps everybody the president's staff
16:09
announces that he's going to make a statement as you know the special Council released this findings today
16:14
about they looking to my handling of classified documents mean at first he looks like he's taking a Victory lap I
16:20
was pleased to see he reached the firm conclusion that no charges should be
16:25
brought against me in this case he's talking about how he has been exonerated
16:31
and that is in fact still the bottom line of the report the special Council acknowledged I cooperated completely he
16:37
talks about how this you know exhaustive investigation included very long interviews in moments of intense
16:43
pressure I want forward with a 5H hour inperson 5H hour inperson interview over two days on October the 8th and 9th of
16:51
last year even though Israel had just been attacked by Hamas on the 7th and I was very occupied and he cited the
16:58
special council's own statements praising him for his cooperation which of course is in great contrast to former
17:05
president Trump right who's charged with trying to literally obstruct government officials who are seeking classified
17:11
documents back in addition I know there's some attention paid to some language in the report about my
17:16
recollection of events but then the president goes on the attack there's even reference that I don't
17:23
remember when my son died how in the hell dare he raise that
17:29
and specifically Biden mentions the part of the report that says he couldn't remember when his son died at this point
17:37
you see the anger especially in his face and he's kind of gritting his teeth almost as he's responding frankly when I
17:45
was asked the question I thought to myself wasn't any of their damn business right he's angry but he's not denying
17:52
any of hers clams about memory lses no
17:58
he's not denying any of the very specific things that her is saying he's most upset that it suggests that he doesn't remember his son's death and of
18:04
course he remembers his son's death that was one of the most seing moments of his life Robert her wasn't saying he didn't remember that Robert her was saying he
18:09
didn't remember the date right but for President Biden it was a step too far it was an inflammatory thing to say their
18:15
task was to make a decision about whether to move forward with charges in this case that was their decision to
18:22
make that's the council's decision to make that's his job and they decided not
18:27
to move forward for any extraneous commentary they don't know what they're talking about it has
18:34
no place in this report the bottom line As a matter is now closed I'm going to
18:39
continue what I've always focused on my job of being president of the United States of America now thank you and I'll
18:45
take some questions and then there's a feisty question and answer session with
18:51
the White House Press courp on all these issues right President Biden something
18:57
the special counsil said in his report is that one of the reasons you were not charged is because in his description
19:04
you are a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory I'm well meaning and I'm
19:11
an elderly man and I know what the hell I'm doing I've been president most dramatically he has his back and forth with a Fox news reporter Peter Ducey who
19:18
asks him can you continue put this country back on his feet I don't need his recommendation totally how bad is
19:24
your memory and can you continue as president my memory is so bad I let you
19:30
speak Biden pushes it back on him saying my memory is so bad I let you speak and
19:35
I think that was an effective moment for Biden to kind of turn the question back around right and so this is almost a
19:43
very effective moment of political performance until it's not yeah he's so
19:51
close thank you all very very much he's walking out the door he has said what he wants to say but he hears here's a
19:58
question about [Music]
20:05
Gaza and he decides to turn around and come back to the podium and back to the microphone to answer the question and he
20:11
gives some actually important news there he says the conduct of the
20:18
response in Gaza in the Gaza Strip has been
20:23
um over the top that Israel's response in Gaza was over the top that was much
20:29
sharper than he has said before but then he makes a mistake the president of Mexico CCE did not want to open up the
20:37
gate to allow humanitarian material to get in I talked to him he says the
20:43
president of Mexico when he means the president of Egypt and it's not that big
20:48
a deal obviously but in this moment right in this particular moment when people are focused on his memory and his
20:56
ability to to speak correctly in the end it distracts from the message
21:01
he had just delivered about how sharp he was right once this news conference is
21:06
over it did feel pretty clear that something had changed right and that
21:12
when it comes to this question of his memory his Acuity this was something of
21:18
a turning point and the question becomes how much of a turning point does it matter will it go away and I'm curious
21:27
does this moment change anything about how the Democratic party treats Biden at
21:34
this very important moment when he's the presumed nominee coasting towards becoming the Party's candidate for
21:42
reelection and does it change how Biden conducts himself as president and as
21:49
candidate yeah let's start with a party I mean there are Democrats like David oxar who of course was Obama's top
21:56
adviser and who knows Biden well from the time he was vice president who were saying that age is a real issue and that
22:01
they need to take it seriously they have questioned whether it was a great idea to nominate a candidate of this age in a
22:08
race that's so important from the Democratic point of view to win but is this a turning point of the conversation
22:15
I mean the thing is I think prior to this report the White House had done a
22:20
pretty good job of tring of Tamp down concern in the Democratic party to the point where they had convinced a lot of
22:27
people who may have doubts about him to recognize he was going to be their candidate anyway so it was time to try
22:32
to move on past that issue and not focus on it and then you have this report come out that puts it front and center again
22:39
and causes a lot more hand ringing inside the party about what they're
22:44
going to do with a candidate who's 81 years old yes but at a stage in the
22:51
Democratic nomination process where it does feel more or less impossible to do
22:58
anything about it yeah I mean the reality is nobody can talk Joe Biden out of running at this point except maybe
23:04
his wife and she's all on board so he has spent decades trying to become the
23:10
president of the United States and then you want to tell him not to to run again no way you know he he feels I think very
23:15
grieved at this idea that he shouldn't run for a second term when he feels like he's done a really good job in in the
23:20
first term so far and he also feels he is uniquely suited to beat Donald Trump
23:26
because he's the one guy who did beat Don Donal Trump in 2020 right and in fact other Democrats deferred to him
23:32
whether they thought it was a good idea or not really nobody challenged him I mean dean Phillips a congressman from Minnesota got in the race and he got
23:39
clobbered in the New Hampshire primary where Biden wasn't even on the ballot and people wrote him in so there is no
23:46
plausible scenario at this point for any candidate other than President Biden unless something happens between now and
23:53
the election that forces a change right nor and it seems important to mention that this is there anything approaching
24:00
a meaningful public call to even have that conversation at this point exactly
24:07
they recognize that that conversation is too late to have at this point and so a lot you hear from some Democrats even
24:13
the ones who are uncomfortable with that you know a call to say enough of the discussion about this we need to figure out how to how to beat the other guy not
24:20
so much beating up on our own guy right and so in effect the Baseline strategy is to say okay sure Biden is old but
24:27
Trump is crazy that's the argument they're going to make and wouldn't you rather have a well-meaning but elderly
24:33
guy to paraphrase Robert her report versus a person who in their View and in the view of a lot of Americans is
24:39
reckless and dangerous and then Trump himself decides to say something that
24:47
will play right into the Democratic strategy well very much South Carolina
24:53
we've had a great relationship with South Carolina thank you so he's in
24:58
South Carolina at a rally on Saturday just two days after the her report comes out and he's talking about NATO and how
25:05
NATO members should be spending more on their military and he's been pushing them to do it and he recounts the story
25:10
where he says anyway a NATO Ally once asked him well sir uh if we don't pay
25:16
and we're attacked by Russia will you protect us I said you didn't pay you're
25:21
delinquent if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia will you protect us and he says no no I would not protect
25:27
you in fact I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want you got to pay you got to pay your bills Not only
25:33
would I not protect you he says he would encourage the Russians to do whatever the hell they want in other words he
25:39
would encourage an enemy to attack America's own treaty allies well most
25:45
politicians have said to that yes we will protect you under any circum well
25:50
then they're never paying up right and suddenly the question of Biden's age is
25:55
no longer the central story of the moment and it's put in a very different
26:00
perspective yeah absolutely is right exactly it's not just that he changes the subject which is important and
26:06
helpful to the Biden Camp it's that he helps the Biden people reframe the age question to say which is more important
26:13
to you somebody who you know forgets a name or can't uh summon a date or
26:19
somebody who would completely undermine the entire International order as we have known it for generations and from
26:27
there Viewpoint this helps put the age question in perspective mhm but I think
26:32
what's ultimately so fascinating about this moment is the reality that Biden
26:41
those around him the Democratic party arguably have made the choice in this
26:47
election perhaps more complicated than it ever really needed to be if you think
26:54
that Trump is a unique thread and so many many Democrats argue that so many
27:00
Democratic leaders argue that then you have the hard but necessary debate about
27:07
whether the 81-year-old President Joe Biden should be the
27:13
nominee whether it makes sense whether it creates the strongest possible chances for victory and Democrats didn't
27:23
do that they didn't they just pretty much went through the motion to renominate Biden so how do you think
27:32
about that yeah I mean I think that's a very interesting question an important question the party didn't really have
27:39
that conversation in an open way they deferred to the incumbent president because he wanted to run again and
27:45
because they thought at at least one point that his argument that he was the one person who could beat Trump would be
27:52
the safest Pair of Hands in a way but the polls show he's not the polls show that he's running even or even behind
27:58
former president Trump and in fact is not a guarantee to win in 2024 right in other words the party made
28:06
a risky bet when their argument is that the risk on the other side is intolerable and to that point Peter how
28:15
does the president those around him the party plan for a 10mon long campaign now
28:24
where eyes are trained on the question of Biden his age his Acuity and what do we
28:31
understand to be their strategy for making the most of a pretty tricky situation yeah there's actually a lot of
28:38
debate and attention about this within Biden World there are those who want to protect him make sure that he doesn't
28:44
have too many opportunities to make mistakes that would embarrass him and there are those around him there are
28:49
people in The Wine House in the administration I hear say let him lose put him out there and he will do fine
28:55
most broadly though I think the broad strategy is they're just going to have to gut it
29:01
out there's no chance of changing candidates at this point so just live with it make the contrast with former
29:08
president Trump make the argument that you've got two old men both of whom have their issues about age but that one of
29:14
them is a responsible actor and the other's not and the question is will they be
29:19
able to make that case the American public and will the American public buy
29:25

back here's what else you need to another day today after not just a long
29:56
night and weekend but after months of work we can say it's been worth it on
30:03
Tuesday after months of tense bipartisan negotiations the US Senate passed a long
30:09
awaited foreign aid package for Ukraine and Israel that now appears doomed in
30:15
the US House the $95 billion Aid package was originally linked to tougher
30:21
security measures at the US Mexico border as Congressional Republicans had demanded but once former president Trump
30:29
denounced that bill the Senate proceeded with legislation that funded Israel and
30:34
Ukraine without border security despite overwhelming support for the legislation
30:40
in the Senate Republican house Speaker Mike Johnson said he would refuse to
30:45
bring the bill up for a vote in his chamber because it lacks border security
30:51
despite opposing the version of the bill that contained border security and I I
30:57
call on speaker Johnson to rise to the occasion to do the right thing bring
31:03
this bill to the floor in a speech on Tuesday Democratic Senate Majority
31:08
Leader Chuck Schumer pleaded with Johnson to change his mind it is clear
31:13
that if that bill is brought to the floor our bill is brought to the floor it will
31:19
pass and on this vote the Y are 214 and the Nays are 213 the resolution is
31:26
adopted House Republicans have impeached the
31:31
Secretary of Homeland Security after trying and failing to do so last week
31:38
Republicans have shown no evidence that the secretary Alejandro mayorcas has
31:43
committed any constitutional crimes but instead based their impeachment on
31:49
objections to his policies which they say have failed to secure the Border
31:55
there is no chance that mayorca will be convicted in the Senate which is controlled by
32:01
democrats finally in the closely watched special election to fill the seat of
32:07
Republican representative George Santos of New York who was expelled over his lies and financial schemes the
32:14
Democratic candidate Tom swazi has defeated his Republican opponent because Democrats have flipped
32:21
the seat Republicans can now lose only two votes on any partisan
