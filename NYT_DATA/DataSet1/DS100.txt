Trumpâ€™s Cash Crunch



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Michael aaro
0:03
this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:12
daily last week when a civil court judge
0:15
in New York ruled against Donald Trump
0:18
he imposed a set of penalties so severe
0:21
that they could temporarily sever Trump
0:24
from his real estate Empire and wipe out
0:27
all of his cash to today my colleagues
0:31
Jonah bramwit and Maggie hberman explain
0:35
what that will mean for Trump the
0:37
businessman and Trump the
0:42
candidate it's Friday February

[Music]
0:50
23rd Jonah and Maggie thank you for
0:53
coming in thanks for having us thank you
0:56
so last week the judge overseeing one of
0:58
the many cases against Donald Trump
1:01
issued a ruling that put simply was a
1:04
bombshell the single most devastating
1:08
penalty really ever against the former
1:11
president and that's what we want to
1:13
talk to you about the Fallout from that
1:16
ruling and we turn to you Jonah because
1:18
you have covered the case day-to-day in
1:21
the courtroom for months and Maggie
1:23
because you know Trump arguably better
1:25
than anyone as one of his biographers
1:27
Jonah just to start remind us what this
1:31
case was fundamentally about so this
1:35
case is about fraud and specifically the
1:37
New York attorney general accused Donald
1:39
Trump his company of exaggerating the
1:43
value of their properties that includes
1:45
golf clubs hotels apartment buildings
1:48
what the AG said that Trump did was take
1:51
those things say that they were much
1:53
more valuable than they actually were
1:55
and as a result got better loan terms
1:58
from Banks from insurers profiting from
2:00
what they said was fraud and in a lot of
2:03
ways the case became a standin for the
2:04
broader question that has hung over him
2:06
for years which is is he a fraud not
2:08
just did he commit fraud but is he a
2:11
fraud is he personally a fraud and is
2:13
this Empire that he built over decades
2:15
and this public Persona that he built
2:17
over decades essentially built on a
2:19
foundation of Lies H and Jonah we knew
2:22
really early on that the judge in this
2:25
case was Finding against Trump that
2:28
happened ago and the question was always
2:33
around the penalties that were going to
2:34
be levied against Trump so Jonah having
2:36
covered the case day in day out in the
2:38
courtroom just talk us through at a very
2:41
high level what those penalties were and
2:44
then I think we're going to walk through
2:44
them one by one in more detail sure so
2:47
the first penalty is a cash penalty and
2:50
it's enormous it started out as 355
2:52
million so that's already a pretty
2:54
sizable number but then we're looking at
2:56
interest on top of that which actually
2:58
vaults it all the way to 450 million wow
3:01
nearly half a billion bucks right it's
3:03
just as simple as that Donald Trump now
3:05
owes $450 million from this case alone
3:09
there's bans on Trump running his
3:11
company there's bans on him getting
3:12
loans from New York Banks and then
3:14
they've installed a monitor at the Trump
3:16
organization which sounds as if it's
3:18
maybe a little bit less of a big deal
3:20
than those other two but in fact as I
3:21
think we'll talk about is a very big
3:23
deal okay I want to start Jonah with the
3:27
eye
3:28
popping final penalty in in this case so
3:31
just walk us through it sure so one of
3:33
the big things to know here is that this
3:35
is not a fine this is not the judge who
3:37
was the one who decided it saying Donald
3:39
Trump did these bad things and thus I am
3:41
going to find him this enormous amount
3:43
this is what's called disgorgement and
3:45
what it really is is the calculation of
3:48
how much money Trump made through fraud
3:51
so at trial the Attorney General said we
3:53
believe that it was about 370 million
3:57
plus interest and the judge did his own
3:59
calculations they're in the ruling and
4:00
he found that it was very very close to
4:02
that so about 355 million with interest
4:07
becomes something like $450 million huge
4:10
number can you just walk us through how
4:12
you can possibly calculate that
4:15
somebody's lies about their property
4:17
value represent
4:20
350 or I guess 400 with interest million
4:23
dollars worth of basically ill gotten
4:26
gains so one of the interesting things
4:28
in this case is that you don't have TR
4:29
victims but the banks are kind of the
4:32
stands in for the victims these are the
4:33
entities that would have made more money
4:35
had Trump not gotten the terms that he
4:38
got so the way that this is calculated
4:40
is you look at the banks lost profits
4:43
that's an enormous amount of the
4:45
discouragement add that to interest and
4:47
then the recent sale of two properties
4:49
that was also aided by the fraud and two
4:51
properties sold by Trump that's right
4:53
and that's where you get this number
4:54
okay so the thinking is if Trump had
4:57
properly valued the properties he was
4:59
getting the loans for then the banks
5:03
would have made more money and therefore
5:06
in a sense the judges taking that money
5:08
from Trump and giving it now to the
5:10
banks no it goes to New York state
5:12
that's the funny thing because the banks
5:13
weren't set up as victims in the way
5:15
this works so they say to Trump you made
5:18
x amount of money from your fraud no one
5:21
should be allowed to make money from
5:22
fraud in New York state we want the
5:24
marketplace to work thus to deter other
5:26
Bad actors in This Marketplace we're
5:28
going to take that money from you we're
5:29
going to give it to the good people of
5:30
New York State got it and Maggie this
5:33
number $450 million or so huge on paper
5:39
but help us understand what it means to
5:42
Donald Trump whose wealth is always been
5:45
something of a moving Target yeah it's
5:47
huge in the wallet too our understanding
5:50
mine Jonah's and our colleague Ben
5:52
protest is understanding from looking at
5:53
documents and talking to sources is that
5:56
he has a little under $400 million in
5:59
liquid assets um that's less than he now
6:02
owes that's correct it's not nothing but
6:04
it's less than he now owes and that's
6:06
just in one case there's another case
6:08
where he has a judgment as well so right
6:09
the Ean Carol Case where he owes I think
6:11
about 83 million 83 million plus
6:13
interest so it is a staggering amount of
6:15
money he testified in a deposition last
6:18
year that he had about 400 million in
6:20
cash let's say that that was true we
6:21
can't verify that it's still not enough
6:24
Jonah he's not going to go bankrupt over
6:27
this but how do you meet a financial o
6:29
ation this big when your cash situation
6:32
doesn't really allow for it it's a
6:33
really difficult thing to do his net
6:36
worth is really bound up in these
6:37
properties and so he has a couple of
6:40
different ways to address this one is to
6:43
get a bond which essentially means
6:45
having someone vouch for him that he
6:47
will eventually pay this money if the
6:50
ruling is upheld on appeal that's the
6:52
easiest way to do it but it's not quite
6:54
as easy as you might think he has to
6:55
find someone to vouch for him he
6:57
probably has to put up collateral either
6:58
in the form of a bill building or in a
7:00
huge amount of money or promises so
7:03
that's really difficult and then if he
7:05
doesn't he might actually have to resort
7:07
to liquidating one of the buildings
7:09
which again not as easy as it sounds
7:11
right Magie is it right to think that no
7:13
matter how he eventually and I suspect
7:15
we all think he will eventually be able
7:16
to put together the money to pay this
7:19
penalty that this is kind of humiliating
7:21
for somebody whose identity is so bound
7:23
up in wealth there's no question it's
7:27
both humiliating and infuriating in
7:28
terms of
7:30
his sense of being unmasked to a degree
7:33
as we are all sitting here talking about
7:34
he's actually worth that's a big problem
7:36
for him psychologically it always has
7:38
been because he is very aware of the
7:41
impact this can have on how he sells
7:43
himself and presents himself and also
7:44
the reality of what this means for his
7:46
company a company that has remained in
7:48
New York all this time even as he became
7:50
a Florida resident okay so that is the
7:54
money and it's messy the second element
7:57
I want to understand is this decision to
8:01
Bar Trump from running the Trump
8:05
organization and I know it also is a ban
8:09
against his two sons being involved in
8:11
the company as well so just walk us
8:14
through that it seems like it would be
8:15
very hard to take the trumps out of the
8:18
Trump organization so here's what we do
8:20
know Donald Trump who was no longer
8:23
really running the business of the
8:24
company on a day in day out basis but
8:26
still owns it he was banned from serving
8:29
as the leader of a New York company for
8:31
3 years his two sons including Eric
8:33
Trump who is the day in day out leader
8:36
of the Trump organization they're banned
8:38
for two years and so that's one of the
8:40
big question marks here what exactly
8:42
does it mean when the person who runs
8:44
this major part of the Trump
8:46
organization may not be allowed to run
8:48
this major part of the Trump
8:49
organization how will the company
8:51
continue to function right well Maggie
8:53
what's your sense of the answer to that
8:55
I mean how knowing what you know about
8:57
the Trump organization does it function
8:59
when Dad and two sons the owner of the
9:01
company basically and the two people
9:04
most identified as his leaders have been
9:06
told by a court don't run the company
9:09
it's complicated people want to meet
9:11
with the trumps people want to meet with
9:13
the former president Donald Trump is you
9:15
know the most famous name in the world
9:17
um when people want something out of
9:18
this company they are going to want to
9:19
have the feeling that they are meeting
9:21
with a member of the family because it
9:22
is a family company and can they well
9:25
that's a complicated question I think we
9:27
don't really know the answer and I think
9:28
a lot of that is going to get worked out
9:30
as we go by the monitor who is
9:32
overseeing the company and I think that
9:34
you will see the attorney general
9:35
watching that process very closely the
9:38
company will still exist but the
9:39
question remains that without the trumps
9:42
as the people leading it or seen as
9:44
leading it we don't know what kind of
9:45
deals they're going to be able to strike
9:47
we don't know where this goes yeah and
9:48
this is where the third punishment the
9:50
monitor really comes right just
9:51
mentioned the monitor just explain what
9:52
a monitor is what it does and how it
9:55
fits into the new universe of the Trump
9:58
organization given this
9:59
so this monitor is a former federal
10:01
judge her name is Barbara Jones and
10:03
she's essentially a corporate babysitter
10:05
she overlooks everything that the Trump
10:09
organization may want to do regarding
10:11
its finances and she's checking for
10:13
fraud she's looking at particular
10:15
transactions and really scrutinizing
10:17
them and the Trump organization as a
10:19
private company has just never undergone
10:22
this level of scrutiny before so when
10:24
they're trying to maneuver and think
10:26
about how they want to go about doing
10:28
their business to make money continuing
10:30
to run the company they're going to have
10:31
this person overseeing their every move
10:35
and to be clear that was by Design the
10:36
judge specifically noted in his ruling
10:40
that Trump had expressed very little
10:42
remorse for the fraud that he found and
10:46
in fact had continued to commit it and
10:48
so the monitor is there because the
10:51
judge simply does not trust Donald Trump
10:53
and that was made completely explicit
10:56
how does Donald Trump Maggie and how do
10:58
his sons regard having a government
11:02
monitor in their midst not happily
11:05
Michael um I analogize it to a moment in
11:09
yet another court case that Donald Trump
11:11
is facing the investigation into his
11:13
possession of classified documents at
11:15
marago where according to court filings
11:18
he said to one of his lawyers I really
11:20
don't want people going through my boxes
11:23
and those boxes were the boxes of
11:25
documents and he didn't want his lawyer
11:27
and others looking through
11:29
my boxes it's mine my company my
11:32
government my possessions he does not
11:35
want an outside monitor there right if
11:37
you don't want your own lawyer going
11:39
through the federal government papers
11:40
owed to the federal government you don't
11:42
want a monitor looking over your
11:45
shoulders as you run your company and
11:47
then the crazy thing about the monitor
11:49
is we think of all these penalties as
11:51
these discret things there's the
11:52
financial penalty there's the Bands then
11:54
there's the monitor but they all work
11:56
together in this really difficult way
11:58
for the Trump organization because
12:00
they're trying to scr up money they're
12:01
trying to figure out who will run the
12:03
company and all the while they have a
12:05
monitor who's answerable to the judge
12:07
making their lives slower more
12:10
complicated and ultimately more
12:12
difficult and I think when you think
12:13
about the punishments it's actually
12:14
important not to think of them as
12:16
separate but really to think about how
12:17
they complicate each other how the
12:19
penalty complicates the monitor
12:20
complicates the bands and who runs the
12:22
Trump organization and how Donald Trump
12:24
feels about it God think these all
12:25
interlock but not in a complimentary way
12:27
but like a sand in the gear kind of way
12:29
so if you're Trump if you decide that to
12:33
pay this $450 million penalty you want
12:36
to sell a building correct me if I'm
12:38
wrong Jonah the monitor might look over
12:41
your shoulders and say no not that
12:43
building and so suddenly Trump's plan to
12:46
actually pay the penalty gets mucked up
12:48
by the monitor I think it's safe to
12:50
assume that the monitor is going to be
12:51
involved in all kinds of different
12:53
things in ways that just make Trump's
12:55
life fundamentally unpleasant right I
12:58
mean the IM image that's coming to my
13:00
head is the one from watching Trump in
13:04
the reality TV show right like you're
13:06
fired and what it now feels the reality
13:09
of trump is is a guy saying you're fired
13:14
but I really can't run the company and I
13:17
can only fire you if the monitor says I
13:19
can fire you right that's basically as
13:21
Jonah said his hands are essentially
13:24
[Music]
13:25
tied as much as he liked rejecting this
13:29
image of a guy who you know what he says
13:31
goes and his orders go and whatever he
13:34
says the boss is in charge he really
13:36
can't do that now I mean to the extent
13:38
that it ever was that way at the Trump
13:40
organization it really is not
13:42
[Music]
13:44
now and so a very important piece of his
13:49
Public Image and I think frankly his
13:50
self-image at this point has been
13:52
Stripped Away From
13:53
[Music]
13:57
Him
14:00
[Music]
14:05
we'll be right
14:09
back Magie we've been talking about how
14:12
this penalty is going to hurt Trump as a
14:15
businessman and just as a rich guy who
14:17
is about to be less rich but I want you
14:20
to explain what it means to Trump as the
14:23
de facto Republican nominee for
14:25
president to have a penalty of this
14:28
scale
14:29
on the one hand it very much feels like
14:31
a ruling like this fits into Trump's
14:33
narrative that the Democratic blue state
14:35
establishment is out to get him on the
14:38
other hand as you've started to hint at
14:40
a big part of Trump's appeal was that he
14:43
is a hugely successful businessman and
14:46
this very much undercuts that by saying
14:48
you were a fraud so how should we think
14:51
about what this penalty does to Trump a
14:54
candidate in terms of how he appeals to
14:56
his base of Voters it's very helpful to
14:58
him and frankly in terms of appealing to
15:01
even business people who might be center
15:03
right but on the fence about Trump liked
15:05
some of his policies a lot of them
15:07
identify with him on this and think that
15:09
he's being treated unfairly is it
15:10
because of the number it's because of
15:12
the state coming and taking your
15:14
business which is how he is going to
15:16
continue to present this he is not going
15:19
to present it as they came after me for
15:20
fraudulent tactics it's going to be I
15:22
ran a successful company and they're
15:24
coming after me and that's been every
15:25
single one of his fundraising emails
15:26
about this topic right actually got one
15:28
of the emails Maggie I want to read the
15:30
language from it this is from a Donald
15:32
Trump fundraising email that came right
15:33
after this finding do you support
15:35
president Trump more or less after every
15:38
single Witch Hunt raid indictment and
15:41
arrest that the radical left has thrown
15:44
at him he's saying this is like every
15:46
single one of the other ones well part
15:47
of his strategy Michael has been to
15:50
smear all of these court cases with one
15:52
facade right which is that this is
15:54
essentially the state coming at me and
15:56
so this plays into that and you will see
15:58
him continue to say that however to your
16:01
question it does take a bit of anax to
16:04
the self-image that he has continued to
16:07
put out there and I think you will see
16:09
President Biden and Democrats focusing
16:11
on that focusing on it how focusing on
16:14
it by highlighting that a court just
16:17
found him guilty of widespread fraud I
16:19
think you were going to hear Democrats
16:21
saying this is how he ran his business
16:23
and he can't run his own business for 3
16:24
years why should he be allowed to run
16:26
the country for four years you're going
16:28
to hear something like that and they're
16:30
going to try to tie it to the economy
16:32
the economy is what most voters vote on
16:34
and they'll try to suggest that he is
16:36
bad with money and because he is bad
16:37
with money he should not be in charge of
16:39
the US government and your money and I
16:41
think whether that will be successful or
16:43
not I don't know but I think that's
16:44
where this is going John I want to turn
16:46
to the idea of the animated activated
16:49
Trump base of Voters who sees this
16:53
penalty as the latest invitation to show
16:56
their support for Trump technically
16:59
speaking on paper could Trump harness
17:02
that anger to basically fund raise his
17:05
way out of the financial hole he's now
17:08
in could he set up a legal defense fund
17:11
could he ask supporters to basically
17:13
bail him out of this hypothetically
17:16
speaking 100% he can absolutely do that
17:18
the one thing that I think he could not
17:20
do is tell people that the money is for
17:23
a different purpose than it is but if
17:25
he's upfront about what this money is
17:26
for and given what Maggie said I don't
17:28
see that there's any reason not to be
17:30
upfront he can set up a legal defense
17:32
fund and see if he can raise some money
17:35
now whether he can actually raise that
17:36
money and this is a good question for
17:38
Maggie I think just for this particular
17:41
problem that's another question Maggie
17:44
well it's money that in theory could be
17:46
going to his campaign and so his
17:48
campaign is already underfunded compared
17:50
to President Biden's and we saw that
17:51
again in numbers that came out in recent
17:53
days so I think he is going to have to
17:57
make choices if that's the route he
17:59
takes right every dollar you ask someone
18:01
to give you for your legal defense Fund
18:03
in this case is potentially a dollar
18:06
that doesn't go to the campaign that as
18:08
you're saying is already falling behind
18:09
Joe Biden in terms of fundraising
18:11
correct and so this is a a low dooll
18:14
fundraising base that he has gone to
18:15
over and over and over again his donors
18:18
his own donors and they've been asked to
18:20
rise up and defend him over and over and
18:22
over again fatigue may be inevitable and
18:24
so at a certain point you know there are
18:26
choices that will have to be make with
18:28
eight months left of this campaign and
18:30
him as the likely nominee just to to
18:33
think of this another way this judgment
18:34
alone just the New York AG case putting
18:37
aside the EEG Carroll case just the New
18:41
York AG case is nearly half a billion
18:43
dollars uh a presidential nomination for
18:47
for a general election candidate that
18:49
campaign generally costs about a billion
18:51
dollars so it's about half the cost of a
18:53
presidential run in 2024 so if you put
18:56
them together you're saying it's going
18:57
to be a lot to ask the American people
19:00
even Trump's most fervent supporters to
19:02
hand over 1.5 billion which would be the
19:05
cost of a campaign as well as bailing
19:07
him out of this legal predicament it's a
19:09
it's a lot of money I want to turn to a
19:11
delicate but really interesting question
19:13
which is what does it look like for
19:15
Trump to run for president and
19:17
potentially win back the presidency when
19:20
he's basically out of cash and does that
19:24
create a new set of incentives for him
19:27
when he's president that we should be
19:29
thinking about well you know just on the
19:31
simplistic level he would get free
19:32
housing and free Transportation so put
19:34
that aside it's so hard to answer
19:37
because when he was president starting
19:39
in 2017 he never put the company to
19:41
Blind trust they stopped doing foreign
19:43
deals and his sons took over but there
19:45
were all sorts of foreign officials who
19:48
stayed at the Trump Hotel and that was
19:50
seen as a a back door way of getting
19:52
foreign money to Trump and remember it's
19:55
not just the second he becomes president
19:57
there's 8 months left
19:58
of a presidential race where he's the
20:01
likely nominee and there could be
20:03
foreign governments or foreign entities
20:05
that are going to try to Curry favor
20:07
with him by doing deals now your thing
20:09
if you're a business who wants to get in
20:11
the good graces of the next president of
20:13
the United States this is a good moment
20:16
because he's not president and can do a
20:18
deal and those companies would know that
20:20
he needs money correct I mean I was
20:22
going to say just speaking very
20:24
hypothetically we know what Trump's past
20:26
behavior is and we know what the incent
20:28
here would be and we're really looking
20:29
at Uncharted landscape in terms of what
20:32
this might actually look like I think
20:34
that these are guesses we should
20:35
emphasize that they gu have no we have
20:36
no idea what will actually happen but
20:39
but there is a theoretical case they're
20:40
well-informed guesses yeah okay got it
20:43
we've talked a lot Maggie especially
20:44
with you about how reelection for Trump
20:48
has been key to his plan for solving the
20:52
legal problems he has in so many
20:54
different cases the idea is he could win
20:56
he could ask his future return attorney
20:58
general to drop the federal cases
21:00
against him the classified documents
21:01
case the January 6
21:03
case civil cases and local cases like
21:07
this case would seem to be more
21:09
complicated so does becoming president
21:12
do anything to alleviate the unique
21:15
burdens of this case and this penalty
21:17
short answer is no I mean one one thing
21:19
has absolutely nothing to do with the
21:20
other now you are correct we have had
21:22
any number of conversations about the
21:24
impact that him winning a second term
21:27
could imp act the federal cases against
21:29
them and there are two but there's also
21:31
two State cases in addition to this
21:34
particular case is a civil case the Ean
21:36
Carol Case is a civil case there is
21:37
nothing he can do about that now could
21:40
becoming president slow down the gears
21:42
of certain things in theory yes again we
21:46
are facing such a new Dynamic here with
21:48
all of this were he to become president
21:50
again that I I don't even know how to
21:51
Fathom how half of this would work um
21:54
but the short answer is he does not have
21:56
a magic wand as president impact these
21:58
cases but in a way you'd rather be
22:00
president if you're in this situation
22:02
than not be president I think he
22:04
discovered through all of the legal
22:06
Trails he faced while he was President
22:08
it was better to be president than
22:10
not but what's really interesting kind
22:12
of about where we are now and what we're
22:14
talking about is it is different for him
22:17
to be after this case and In This Moment
22:21
facing actual consequences of this type
22:24
where the penalty has already been
22:26
demanded of him
22:30
Trump seems to face a lot of heat but he
22:33
always gets out of it you know he gets
22:34
out of these bankruptcies he gets out of
22:35
the Access Hollywood tape during the
22:37
2016 election he gets out of
22:38
impeachments twice exactly yeah but here
22:41
we already have the consequences
22:43
demanded of him and it seems highly
22:46
unlikely right as he's running for
22:48
president again that he's going to be
22:49
able to get out of paying these things
22:51
or dealing with them in some
22:53

23:03
well Maggie Jonah thank you very much
23:06
thank you thank

[Music]
23:23
you we'll be right
23:26
back
23:29
here's what else you need to day the
23:32
mother of Alexi naali the Russian
23:34
opposition leader who has died in prison
23:36
said that the government has refused to
23:38
release her son's remains unless she
23:41
agrees to a secret funeral that would
23:44
draw no public
23:53
attention in a video lud na accused the
23:58
government of Vladimir Putin of
24:00
illegally blackmailing her by quote
24:03
telling me where when and how Alexi
24:07
should be buried meanwhile during a
24:09
fundraiser President Biden called Putin
24:12
a quote crazy so his harshest language
24:17
to date for the Russian leader in
24:19
response the Kremlin dismissed Biden's
24:22
remarks as quote Hollywood cowboy style
24:26
Behavior designed to win him
