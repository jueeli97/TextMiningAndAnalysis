The Alarming Findings Inside a Mass Shooterâ€™s Brain


0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
tavernes and this is the
0:07
[Music]
0:10
daily a mass shooting last Fall by an
0:13
Army reservist in Maine prompted my
0:16
colleague Dave Phillips to search for
0:18
answers about whether the solders
0:20
service could have been a factor today
0:24
the surprising answer Dave found and how
0:27
it may change our understanding of the
0:29
effect of Modern Warfare on the human
0:36
brain it's Wednesday March

[Music]
0:44
13th so Dave you've been working on a
0:46
series of Stories on injuries to
0:49
soldiers in the US Military and last
0:51
week there was kind of a sudden and
0:53
unexpected Discovery related to that
0:55
reporting you'd been doing tell me about
0:57
it so what I've been looking into for a
1:00
couple months was the idea that soldiers
1:03
can be injured just by firing their own
1:05
weapons by standing next to the blast of
1:08
a mortar or launching a rocket from a
1:12
shoulder fire rocket launcher some of
1:13
these big heavy weapons the blast wave
1:15
is strong enough to really injure their
1:18
brains and I'd been working on that over
1:21
a couple months because it's very new
1:23
and there's a lot of Uncertain stuff and
1:25
I was still working on it in October
1:28
when I got a call from The New York
1:30
Times national desk and they said hey
1:33
there's been a mass shooting in Maine we
1:35
need your help the suspect was in the
1:37
military so I dropped everything and got
1:39
on it right because you're the guy who
1:42
covers military Affairs so they call you
1:44
right and the situation was that there's
1:47
a 40-year-old man in Maine named Robert
1:50
card he'd been a Sergeant First Class in
1:52
the Army Reserves for almost 20 years
1:55
and he killed several people in a small
1:59
town in Maine
2:00
in a restaurant and in a bowling alley
2:03
then he goes on the lamb and the whole
2:06
region is in lockdown for 2 days and
2:10
after a massive Manhunt they eventually
2:12
find his body 15 minutes away from the
2:15
shooting site he had shot himself in the
2:18
head and in the aftermath his family
2:21
said that he had been hearing voices
2:24
started right after he had gotten some
2:26
hearing aids last spring and he grew to
2:29
have these nearly constant paranoid
2:32
delusions that people at the supermarket
2:34
people on the street even people in his
2:36
own family were saying terrible things
2:39
about him essentially saying that he was
2:40
a pedophile and he grew obsessed with
2:43
these delusions that just simply were
2:45
not happening the Army saw this and they
2:49
tried to intervene and in fact he was
2:51
actually hospitalized for two weeks by
2:52
the Army But ultimately it was not
2:55
enough and he committed these shootings
2:59
which killed 18 people and so whenever
3:03
any veteran is involved in any crime our
3:05
first move is generally to ask the
3:08
Pentagon for that person's background we
3:10
want to know is there anything in their
3:12
military record that can help us
3:14
understand the present by looking at
3:16
their military past and so did you find
3:19
anything in this main Shooters military
3:21
records in the case of Robert card the
3:24
answer is really no you know remember
3:28
we've been at War for more than 20 years
3:31
and and more than a million people have
3:32
deployed many of them multiple times he
3:35
had been in the military that whole time
3:37
he had never deployed never in Iraq or
3:39
Afghanistan never in Iraq or Afghanistan
3:42
never even in Germany or Korea huh and
3:45
he also had a really humdrum job the
3:49
official title for it was petroleum
3:52
Supply specialist what does that mean
3:55
essentially you're the gas guy who makes
3:57
sure that that the tanks and the Humvees
3:58
and everything else has enough fuel to
4:00
run uh pretty dull and so there was
4:04
nothing at all in his service that
4:06
suggested it had anything to do with
4:09
what had happened so at this point
4:11
you're like okay nothing to see here
4:13
this mass shooting is probably totally
4:15
unrelated to his time in the military
4:16
because he never deployed right well not
4:19
quite I actually picked up one thing
4:22
that I thought might be really tied to
4:24
this and potentially extremely important
4:26
and that was his hearing aids what was
4:29
it about his hearing aids well here's a
4:32
guy who's 40 years old a young fit guy
4:35
who has hearing aids I would expect that
4:37
from somebody who worked around
4:40
artillery cannons or worked around
4:41
mortars worked around tanks in the
4:43
military you see it all the time but
4:45
this guy didn't seem to have any of that
4:48
he's like a petroleum Supply guy and so
4:50
I was thinking okay something here
4:53
doesn't make sense and I was able to
4:56
track down some people who had actually
4:57
served next to Robert card in his Plato
5:00
and they said yes he had been a
5:03
petroleum Supply specialist years ago
5:05
but in 2014 he switched over to a
5:08
training Battalion where he was exposed
5:11
to lots and lots of blasts and basically
5:15
what this Battalion did is every summer
5:18
they held a summer camp for Cadets at
5:21
West Point that taught them how to use
5:23
all sorts of weapons taught them how to
5:24
use machine guns grenade launchers
5:26
shoulder fired rockets and hand Gren
5:29
ades and that's where Robert card worked
5:32
I learned every year in the summer he
5:35
was on the hand grenade range where
5:36
about 1200 Cadets would come through and
5:40
most of them threw two grenades so every
5:44
year he's getting exposed in the course
5:46
of a few weeks till 2,000 grenade blasts
5:51
now according to the military this is
5:54
safe this is fine no problem move along
5:57
but emerging research like the stuff
5:59
that I been reporting about in the
6:00
previous months had shown that this
6:02
repetitive Blast from firing your own
6:05
weapons can be really damaging and so I
6:08
thought okay Robert card was exposed to
6:11
a lot of blast Maybe that could help
6:14
explain what happened to him so what did
6:16
you do next like how do you start to
6:18
answer that question well we knew that
6:21
the answer would be in Robert card's
6:23
brain that if he did have a brain injury
6:26
from repeated blast exposure you can see
6:28
it and what I learned soon after was
6:31
that the main State medical examiner
6:34
knew that too and in fact after he died
6:37
they had saved his brain and then
6:39
shipped it to Boston where one of the
6:42
best brain Labs that looks at traumatic
6:46
brain injury is at Boston University
6:49
these folks specialize specifically in
6:53
documenting CTE in football players and
6:56
other contact Sports athletes so David
6:59
is the thinking here that maybe Robert
7:01
card had something like CTE that it's
7:04
that kind of injuries like we see in
7:05
football players well they didn't know
7:09
and the only way to figure it out was to
7:11
essentially slice his brain into slices
7:14
that are about the tenth of a thickness
7:16
of a piece of paper and then they look
7:18
at it under two microscopes a normal
7:21
Optical microscope and a really detailed
7:24
electron microscope that can look at
7:26
things on a subcellular level and in the
7:30
first microscope they're looking for CTE
7:33
which is easy to see they can stain it
7:35
brown and it creates these floral
7:36
patterns around blood vessels in the
7:39
brain but when they looked at it they
7:42
didn't find that and if you're just
7:44
exposed to blast Maybe that's not a big
7:46
surprise because the research suggests
7:48
that blast exposure leads to something
7:51
else something that really doesn't have
7:54
an accepted name yet but in a sense is
7:58
damage to the wiring
8:00
that's deep in the brain and under the
8:02
second microscope that's essentially
8:05
what they found in Robert card's brain
8:08
and what they're looking at is sort of
8:11
the cables in the brain so your brain
8:14
has outside of the brain gray matter
8:17
which is where thoughts happen and
8:19
inside the brain is white matter that is
8:22
essentially wiring that connects all
8:24
that gray matter together so it can talk
8:26
to itself it can understand itself it
8:28
can act but it turns out that when blast
8:31
waves surge through the brain those long
8:34
stringy pieces of white matter
8:36
essentially get whipped really hard hard
8:39
enough that they get frayed or broken
8:42
you know think of it like the cable you
8:43
use to charge your iPhone you know you
8:45
can twist that and twist it up and
8:47
untwisted and it'll be fine right but
8:50
it's the repetitive over and over that
8:53
causes problem so imagine twisting your
8:55
iPhone cable 10,000 times and then it
8:59
might still be there but you plug it in
9:02
and it doesn't work anymore and so
9:05
that's what they're looking at in Robert
9:07
card's
9:11
brain so the results were definitive
9:14
despite never having served in combat
9:17
card really suffered pretty severe brain
9:20
damage from these repetitive blasts at
9:22
this training camp it seems like right
9:25
and we have to be careful because we
9:28
can't defend L say with Robert card
9:30
right now that not only those grenade
9:33
blasts caused this injury but that that
9:37
injury caused his behavior what we can
9:40
say is that it's a very very good match
9:42
it certainly seems that that's the case
9:46
and Dave what is the implication of this
9:50
well this is something that means so
9:52
much more than just what happened to
9:54
Robert card or what happened in a
9:57
shooting in Maine and that's because for
10:01
years the military has known that blasts
10:04
from combat from roadside bombs from
10:07
enemy attacks are dangerous and they can
10:10
damage the brain but they haven't known
10:13
what the effect of training is because
10:16
most of the people who served in the
10:18
military also went overseas they might
10:21
have gotten hit by an IED they might
10:23
have experienced something traumatic in
10:25
combat and so if they come back with
10:28
brain injury
10:29
it's very hard to say are those brain
10:33
injuries tied to firing their own
10:35
weapons but Robert cards almost like a
10:38
control
10:39
study we know that he never went
10:42
overseas he also never played football
10:45
in high school he was never in a serious
10:47
car accident he didn't do a lot of
10:49
things that could have caused a brain
10:50
injury to him as far as we know the only
10:53
thing that could have damaged his brain
10:56
is this blast injury of working on the
10:58
grenade range and so if that is true
11:02
that means that a lot of the brain
11:06
injury that is happening in the military
11:08
is being caused by the
11:11
military that's a big
11:15
[Music]
11:26
deal we'll be right back
11:32
so Dave what exactly did the military
11:35
know about brain damage caused by blasts
11:38
and when did it know it well it starts
11:41
with the IED problem during the height
11:43
of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
11:46
around 2005 2006 if you remember
11:49
roadside bombs were the leading way that
11:52
insurgents were hurting American forces
11:54
right and so the United States poured a
11:57
ton of money into trying understand okay
12:01
these blasts that these guys are
12:02
experiencing these men and women they
12:04
appear fine they get up and walk away
12:06
but there's something going on
12:10
there it's not like you know you're
12:13
missing a limb or something so when
12:15
someone walks by you you may look
12:17
absolutely normal but it's a very
12:19
invisible wound the military started
12:22
Gathering these stories and even shared
12:24
some of these interviews when I came
12:25
home I was not the same person and when
12:27
I got out I didn't think that I had any
12:30
issues or mental health issues that
12:32
would affect me in the civilian life I
12:34
found that I was having trouble
12:37
controlling my emotions sometimes my
12:39
anger soldiers were coming home
12:41
complaining to military leaders of all
12:43
sorts of problems you know feeling
12:45
different acting different thinking
12:47
different I ended up losing a job
12:49
because I was getting violent started
12:51
another job was getting violent there
12:54
was real irritable hard to deal with so
12:56
I was self-medicating trying to hide you
12:58
know feel ings and things like that you
13:00
know had the Suicidal
13:04
Thoughts they were almost coming back as
13:06
different people and the defense
13:08
department poured hundreds of millions
13:11
of dollars into this starting probably
13:13
around 2008 trying to answer the
13:16
question of what kind of blast is
13:18
dangerous and why and they started
13:22
getting answers but it was still really
13:24
murky and so in 2012 they set up a brain
13:28
Bank to a essentially collect brains
13:31
from anyone and everyone they could get
13:33
who was in uniform because this injury
13:36
couldn't be seen through an MRI through
13:38
a pet scan through the normal things
13:40
that we think of for Imaging the brain
13:41
it was too subtle but you could slice it
13:44
up and see it in the brain and what they
13:48
were seeing was this Telltale scarring
13:52
in the white matter and at the same time
13:55
there were a lot of families that got
13:57
results back from this brain Bank and
13:59
saw that characteristic scarring in the
14:02
white matter and they knew that their
14:05
loved ones had been affected by blast
14:08
and they also knew that enemy blasts
14:12
were only a small fraction of what their
14:16
loved one experienced and so how could
14:18
you untangle what was training caused
14:21
and what was caused by the enemy and so
14:24
a lot of these families they started
14:26
taking this information to Congress in
14:29
2018 they said to Congress the military
14:32
is not taking blast seriously enough
14:35
they don't understand it they can't tell
14:37
who's injured they need to do something
14:40
congress at that point passed a law
14:42
forcing the military to look at this
14:44
research and figure out how we can track
14:47
this but here we are in
14:49
2024 and a lot of those questions are
14:53
still not answered and then of course
14:56
came card right which seems to give us
14:59
something of a new data point a new
15:01
answer that's right because the
15:03
military for all of this time they had
15:06
kind of been saying well this is
15:08
complicated we did some studies but we
15:10
still don't have clear answers and they
15:12
would hem and ha and essentially use the
15:15
lack of a definitive answer as a way to
15:18
postpone action but here's Robert card
15:21
and he's really important because the
15:23
only thing he's been exposed to is
15:26
grenade blasts and that's to be safe you
15:30
know something did happen after all
15:32
those years of research the military
15:35
they finally put in place a safety
15:37
threshold that basically said above this
15:40
power of blast there could be Hazard and
15:43
they use a number for that they measure
15:45
blast in 4 pounds per square inch that's
15:48
you know the strength of the blast wave
15:50
hitting anybody but you know you can
15:53
think of that four as a safety level
15:55
anything higher probably dangerous
15:57
anything lower supposed to be safe and
16:01
that's why card is so important because
16:03
if he was only exposed to grenades and
16:06
he has a blast injury those grenades
16:09
come in not at four not even at 3.9 they
16:12
come in at like one PSI or maybe one and
16:16
a half so that suggests that this safety
16:19
threshold that got put in place is way
16:22
off and that's really important not just
16:24
for Robert card but for all sorts of
16:27
troops who are training right now
16:29
because there are many weapons out there
16:32
mortars shoulder fired rocket launchers
16:34
big artillery that come in at higher
16:37
levels some of them as high as eight or
16:39
nine
16:41
PSI and what that threshold doesn't take
16:43
into account is that we're not just
16:46
talking about one blast we're talking
16:48
about hundreds or thousands of blasts
16:51
and how does that change how any blast
16:54
is a threat or a hazard so essentially
16:57
all of this study in research didn't
17:00
actually translate into procedures that
17:02
kept soldiers safer right you know it's
17:07
sometimes frustrating for me to see this
17:09
research because there are brilliant
17:11
people who are building computer models
17:14
that model how energy waves go through
17:16
brain matter or they are very carefully
17:20
blowing up Lab Rats and then cutting
17:22
open their brains to see the effects and
17:25
none of that expensive and time
17:27
consuming research has any any
17:29
difference to the people in uniform Dave
17:32
how many vets are we talking about here
17:35
I mean how many people may be suffering
17:38
or at risk of this kind of brain damage
17:40
do we know the scale here that's a
17:43
really hard question to answer we know
17:45
that more than
17:47
450,000 people have been diagnosed with
17:49
a traumatic brain injury by the military
17:51
since
17:52
2000 but that probably leaves out tens
17:57
of thousands of people who
17:59
like Robert card were exposed to
18:03
repeated blasts and may have a brain
18:06
injury but never were diagnosed so the
18:10
universe is potentially very
18:13
large that's why this is such a huge
18:16
deal Dave stepping back for a second you
18:20
know it seems like what we're learning
18:22
here through this example of Robert
18:25
card is kind of bringing us into a
18:28
moment where we're sort of rethinking
18:31
what it means to have combat trauma
18:33
right like that it might actually have a
18:35
lot more to do with the physical blast
18:39
than with the mental or psychological
18:42
trauma that one goes through in say a
18:45
combat
18:46
deployment one thing that I've been
18:48
reporting about for years is when
18:51
soldiers come home different and why you
18:54
know and I started out really focusing
18:56
on post-traumatic stress disorder and
18:59
just the horror of war and how that can
19:01
change and erode your character and then
19:04
I learned that traumatic brain injury
19:06
can be a big part of that and that those
19:09
two things may be Tangled together in
19:11
ways that are impossible to unravel but
19:14
what's really interesting about Robert
19:17
card and other people I've talked to
19:19
who've never deployed but they've been
19:21
around a lot of blast is if you sent
19:23
them into a typical Army Clinic and had
19:25
them list their symptoms they would
19:29
probably get diagnosed with PTSD they're
19:32
Sleepless they have anxiety they have
19:35
panic attacks they are socially
19:38
withdrawn they're depressed so there are
19:41
all these things that we have long
19:43
thought are products of War of combat
19:47
that may actually be an underlying
19:50
condition that is not related to war at
19:53
all you know to put it in the plainest
19:56
terms possible it's basically related to
19:58
a workplace safety issue that we haven't
20:02
acknowledged or addressed so when Johnny
20:06
comes home different from the war it
20:07
might not actually be the war it might
20:11
not actually be the
20:12
[Music]
20:14
war but I also think that there's a
20:16
broader implication beyond the
20:19
military and we can see it in Robert
20:22
card right you know here was a man whose
20:25
blast injury wasn't understood who did
20:28
some something horrendous and so I think
20:31
we have to think
20:32
about what is the cost of not doing
20:35
anything
20:36
here now of course we don't know for
20:39
sure that Robert card did this because
20:43
of his last injury but we do know that
20:45
he had profound injuries deep in his
20:48
brain and we also know from talking to
20:51
people that he served with that it's not
20:54
just Robert card other people that serve
20:57
with him on the grenade range are also
20:59
struggling you know a number of them are
21:02
getting help for pretty persistent
21:05
mental health
21:06
problems and one of his best friends was
21:08
just recently hospitalized for a
21:10
psychiatric crisis and he's now facing a
21:14
domestic violence
21:15
charge so how do we look at those people
21:19
differently now after seeing card and
21:22
how do we look at this problem in a way
21:24
that tries to prevent that from
21:27
happening
21:31
Dave I'm curious if you've heard from
21:33
the family of Robert card since this
21:35
diagnosis and I wonder what this
21:37
diagnosis has meant to them if anything
21:40
well they didn't get a choice when his
21:42
brain went to the lab that was the
21:45
decision of the state which really
21:48
wanted to understand in whatever way it
21:50
could what had happened but when they
21:53
got these results back and the family
21:56
sat around their kitchen table listening
21:59
to the doctor who had looked into his
22:01
brain and learned there was
22:04
damage in a way that I think was really
22:06
surprising to
22:08
them it allowed them to have some
22:15
forgiveness to not see their brother
22:19
their son as a
22:22
monster but to see him as somebody who
22:25
was
22:27
hurt kind of gives them a different
22:29
story about their
22:31
brother
22:33
[Music]
22:46
absolutely Dave thank
22:48
you thank
22:57
you
23:16
we'll be right
23:22
back here's what else you should know
23:24
today my assessment in the report about
23:26
the relevance of the president's memory
23:29
was necessary and accurate and fair on
23:33
Tuesday in a tense appearance before the
23:35
house Judiciary Committee former special
23:38
counsel Robert Herr testified about his
23:40
investigation and February report into
23:43
President Biden's handling of classified
23:46
documents could have written your report
23:48
with comments about his specific
23:50
recollection as to documents or a set of
23:52
documents but you chose a general
23:55
pejorative reference to the president
23:57
the four hour session quickly descended
24:00
into a brutal partisan fight in his
24:03
report her had called Biden quote an
24:06
elderly man with a poor memory a
24:09
conclusion that had infuriated Democrats
24:12
Republicans for their part grilled her
24:15
about his conclusion that the evidence
24:17
was insufficient to charge Biden with a
24:20
crime like here's what I see Biden and
24:22
Trump should have been treated equally
24:24
they weren't and that is the double
24:26
standard that I think a lot of Americans
24:27
are concerned
24:29
and accused her of protecting Biden you
24:32
exonerated I know that willful rtion has
24:36
Mr her it's my time but her made clear
24:39
during the testimony that his report had
24:41
not cleared Biden of wrongdoing
24:44
rejecting a suggestion by democrats that
24:46
it
24:48
