Kids Are Missing School at an Alarming Rate



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Katherine
0:02
benold this is the
0:05
[Music]
0:10
daily today long after schools have
0:14
fully reopened my colleague Sarah MOS
0:17
describes a more permanent shift in the
0:20
way kids and their parents think about
0:22
being in class after the pandemic which
0:25
is that school feels optional and kids
0:28
are still missing a lot of it
0:30
[Music]

[Applause]
0:43
it's Tuesday April

[Music]
0:50
2nd Sarah you're an education reporter
Why isnt it back to normal
0:54
and you've been looking at what's
0:55
happened in schools since the pandemic
0:58
when kids missed many hours of class and
1:00
fell way behind on their learning
1:01
targets it's been 3 years since most
1:04
kids went back to school so one might
1:06
expect things to be almost back to
1:07
normal but you found something
1:09
surprising tell us about that yeah
1:11
things are really not back to normal
1:13
even though it has been quite a while
1:15
since most or all kids have come back to
1:18
the classroom so for example we know
1:21
that kids are still academically behind
1:23
since the pandemic on average US
1:26
students have made up about a third of
1:28
their pandemic learning losses in math
1:31
and about a quarter of their losses in
1:33
Reading H so overall academically
1:36
students are not back to where they
1:38
would have been without the pandemic got
1:40
it and then we're also just seeing still
1:42
a lot of Behavioral challenges in the
1:43
classroom kids having a lot of trouble
1:46
regulating their emotions and their
1:48
ability to sit in the classroom and
1:50
respond in an orderly way and be in a
1:53
really structured environment and so as
1:55
an education reporter I had been
1:56
following all of these Trends and
1:59
wondering like why isn't it back to
2:01
normal and how did you answer that
2:04
question why aren't kids back to normal
2:08
so I came across this data and this
2:10
report that really crystallized things
2:11
for me and it was about absenteeism the
2:14
share of students who are missing a lot
2:17
of days of school before the pandemic
2:20
about 15% of us students were
2:23
chronically absent from school after the
2:26
pandemic 28% of students were
2:29
chronically from school so that's almost
2:31
double wow and last school year the last
2:34
school year for which these National
2:35
estimates are available it was 26% so it
2:39
had barely improved and still one in
2:42
four students were chronically absent
2:44
from school and sah what does
2:46
chronically absent actually mean so the
2:49
way that it's typically defined is being
2:51
absent for at least 10% of the school
2:54
year and that typically works out to
2:56
about 18 days out of the Year m and so
3:00
the reason why all of this matters is
3:02
because students not being in school and
3:05
not being in school regularly relates
3:08
directly back to the things I mentioned
3:09
at the beginning about academic catch-up
3:12
from the pandemic and academic
3:14
performance as well as like their
3:15
ability to regulate their behavior get
3:18
into a routine deal with some of the
3:20
mental health aspects of the pandemic
3:22
and so this issue is a window into
3:25
what's going on in schools today and one
3:27
of the most surprising things we saw and
3:30
the data is that this is really
3:32
happening across demographic groups wow
3:35
so in poor communities which had higher
3:37
absenteeism rates before the pandemic it
3:40
has increased from about 19% before the
3:43
pandemic to around
3:45
32% last school year but in rich
3:48
communities it's also increased from
3:51
about 10% to 19% and this is also
3:54
happening sort of similarly across
3:56
demographics in terms of how long school
3:59
districts stayed remote during the
4:00
pandemic which was a surprise to me so
4:03
you see generally similar increases in
4:06
chronic absenteeism on average in
4:08
districts that were remote the longest
4:11
and districts that were opening
4:13
relatively quickly during the pandemic
4:15
wow that is striking and if it's
4:17
happening across demographic groups is
4:19
it equally happening across age groups
4:23
or uh there differences that you're
4:24
seeing so the way that one source
4:26
described it to me is that chronic
4:28
absenteeism is is like a Nike Swoosh
4:31
explain that what do you mean a Nike
4:33
Swoosh yes so in the early grades you
4:36
see higher rates of absenteeism like in
4:38
kindergarten and first grade and then
4:40
you see this sort of like long tail at
4:42
the end in in Upper grades in high
4:44
school where absenteeism has also
4:47
historically been high so you have the
4:49
least absenteeism in the middle in like
4:52
elementary and middle school and then
4:53
High rates on either end so let's dig
4:57
into that a little more do we know why
5:00
some students still aren't going back to
5:02
school what's causing this
5:05
absenteeism there's no one factor that's
5:08
driving the absences it's more like
5:10
there are a number of factors that pile
5:13
up on top of one another but probably
5:15
the most universally shared reason that
5:18
you'll hear is just illness schools have
5:22
always been germ factories but with Co
5:25
there is ostensibly you know one other
5:27
virus in the mix as well as just a
5:29
feeling of a changed culture around
5:31
going to school and and to work sick and
5:34
I think some hesitance and caution from
5:36
families about sending their child to
5:38
school sick I can totally relate to that
5:41
having three kids of my own there is
5:43
certainly this kind of
5:44
self-consciousness that if somebody
5:46
cuffs or sniffles you feel the sense of
5:49
responsibility of not exposing the world
5:51
to your germs yeah and I think some
5:54
would argue that's been like a positive
5:55
cultural change for everyone's Health
5:57
since the pandemic but it's also
5:59
something that schools are now trying to
6:01
fight against in terms of having some
6:03
new messaging to remind people that
6:05
school is obligatory it is mandatory and
6:09
they're sort of trying to re encourage
6:11
families to send their kids to school
6:13
unless you know they're actively
6:14
throwing up or they have an active fever
6:16
so it's a sort of a new recalculation
6:19
and recalibration so okay sickness is
6:22
one of the things that is keeping kids
6:24
home more what else is going on I think
6:27
mental health and anxiety is another big
6:30
issue something that I heard in a lot of
6:31
interviews with parents and counselors
6:34
so we know that students and children
6:36
experienced increases in depression and
6:39
anxiety during the pandemic lots of
6:41
disruption to their school and home
6:43
lives and what I'm hearing from parents
6:46
as well as counselors is just a lot of
6:49
increases in anxiety and the way that
6:53
students relate to school because they
6:55
were removed from school and were able
6:57
to have distance and a barrier during
7:01
critical periods of development and
7:03
re-engaging with that has been pretty
7:05
hard on a lot of kids hello hey Dana
7:08
again there's this one parent I spoke
7:11
with in Atlanta her name is Dana shepsky
7:14
she's a mom of two teenagers and she
7:16
went through this with her son who's now
7:19
13 so my son he's very bright before the
7:23
pandemic she described him as like
7:26
really social extremely social very
7:28
well-liked extremely athletic and and
7:32
gifted in that way love to do Sports
7:34
there were no sort of major Flags or
7:36
issues regarding his attendance and then
7:39
like everyone else in the spring of 2020
7:42
he was sent home he learns online by
7:45
fall of that year he gets back to school
7:48
relatively quickly but things were not
7:51
normal they had to wear masks and at
7:54
some point things start to take a
Starting Middle School
7:58
turn so he started to withdraw a bit
8:02
from social activities the fear of
8:05
removing his mask in front of the other
8:08
kids overtook his ability to go to
8:11
football out of fear and anxiety and
8:14
that's when we realized that something
8:17
was very wrong eventually he is set to
8:21
start middle school he said I'll be fine
8:24
when school starts in the fall I just
8:26
need the summer to kind of do a reset
8:29
and
8:30
he's sort of telling himself he's going
8:31
to go and it's going to go okay and he
8:34
said he was fine and he was ready and
8:36
then the first day of school came and he
8:38
was not fine he he doesn't go he refused
8:43
to go to school the first few days and
8:45
he kept telling himself that he'll do it
8:48
tomorrow and I think he was really
8:49
convinced of that and each time tomorrow
8:52
would come and he would get up and get
8:54
ready he would get in the car and we
8:56
would get to the parking lot of the
8:57
school and he just couldn't do it it
8:59
took a few days into the school year
9:01
until he would actually go to school and
9:04
when he did it went okay He Saw all his
9:07
friends from fifth grade they were all
9:09
happy to see him he felt great he came
9:12
home and was just so relieved that that
9:14
chapter was over as were we
9:17
unfortunately that was only the
9:19
beginning of um further challenges but
9:22
then it started to get worse he started
9:26
to miss school probably a day or two a
9:29
week he felt like he wasn't really ready
9:33
for the increased demands and pressures
9:36
of Middle School both socially and
9:39
academically and his response to that
9:42
was to just avoid it at any cost
9:45
possible and by later that fall we went
9:48
from missing school one or two days a
9:50
week the first month to by October of
9:54
that school year he was refusing
9:58
entirely he had pretty much stopped
10:00
going
10:02
[Music]
10:05
altogether so it almost seems like
Fear and Anxiety
10:08
Dana's son is stuck in this kind of
10:12
vicious cycle where fear and anxiety be
10:16
get more fear and anxiety yeah and a
10:19
crucial thing is that her and her
10:20
husband were able to work from home
10:22
which is one aspect of this that some
10:24
parents do have the ability to work
10:26
remotely now which she would say like is
10:29
a factor in allowing some of this to
10:31
happen and you know completely refusing
10:34
school is is perhaps an extreme example
10:36
but it is representative of some of the
10:39
the push and pull that kids are
10:41
experiencing right now where feeling
10:43
anxious can make you want to avoid
10:45
school but then the more you don't go to
10:47
school and you're out of your routines
10:50
it can make you feel more anxious about
10:52
going so it can be a vicious cycle and
10:55
for Dana and her family and her son it
10:58
took real professional intervention to
11:01
help him get out of it okay so anxiety
11:04
about school and different feelings
11:07
about sickness are a couple of drivers
11:09
of this absenteeism that we're seeing
11:12
what else yeah there are a number of
11:14
other reasons and for this it can depend
11:17
on family situation so I think it's
11:20
helpful to break it out into two
11:21
different categories higher income
11:23
families and lower income families for
11:26
higher income communities and higher
11:28
income families um here a lot more that
11:30
families are you know like going on
11:32
vacation they're not like so beholden to
11:35
like the spring break calendar it's sort
11:37
of like no problem let's add on a few
11:40
days at the end maybe we'll go off Peak
11:42
Travel season I heard from a number of
11:45
people that just aren't blinking about
11:46
that anymore like you you learn online
11:48
during Co you know we can just sort of
11:50
make it up um online we'll just sort of
11:53
figure it out like there's not that
11:54
sense of obligatory attendance as there
11:58
might have been before so basically the
12:00
pandemic sort of normalized this idea
12:02
that that kids don't always need to show
12:04
up and maybe some parents are even
12:07
taking advantage of that yeah I mean I
12:09
think it's playing out in different ways
12:10
depending on your family circumstance so
12:13
if you're a higher income family maybe
12:15
you're taking advantage of a deal to go
12:16
to Hawaii for two weeks and it's not
12:18
like the peak Peak Travel season but if
12:20
you're a lower income family you have
12:22
different reasons it's sort of the same
12:23
underlying philosophy but they're
12:25
different motivating factors so some of
12:29
the the many reasons that lower income
12:31
communities had higher rates of student
12:33
absences before the pandemic still exist
12:36
your student may have a job and that job
12:39
and the money that it brings in for your
12:40
family is more valuable than like the
12:43
daily attendance as well as needing
12:45
child care and babysitters for for
12:47
younger siblings maybe you were up all
12:50
night with a family situation and you're
12:52
tired and you over sleep you're not
12:53
going to school that day Transportation
12:55
barriers there's like any number of
12:58
reasons but it's also just this feeling
13:00
that it doesn't feel mandatory anymore
13:02
that any of one of those barriers is
13:04
just a little more likely to keep you
13:06
home than before it's quite a contrast
13:08
isn't it it's almost like a perfect
13:10
satirical snapshot of our very unequal
13:13
Society right I mean so disadvantage
13:15
kids missing school because they're
13:16
working and more privileged kids missing
13:19
school because of vacation yeah and
13:22
actually really speaks to like some of
13:24
the other things about absenteeism where
13:26
if you're a higher income student you're
13:27
less likely to be academic Ally affected
13:30
because you're off getting like an
13:31
enriching experience when you're out of
13:33
school whereas lower income students
13:36
it's more harmful for them to miss
13:37
school because the things that they're
13:39
missing for are not necessarily academic
13:42
Replacements so it sounds like there
13:44
were a few things that were set in
13:45
motion by the pandemic that exacerbated
13:48
problems that were already there and
13:50
then because of the way the world
13:52
settled into this new reality and
13:54
developed new habits and attitudes to
13:56
its sickness and remote work you have
13:58
this Kind of Perfect Storm that results
14:01
in kids chronically missing more school
14:04
yeah and I think on an individual level
14:05
for any particular student or family it
14:08
might not seem so significant for the
14:11
one day that you're sick or the one day
14:13
you go on vacation but it does start to
14:16
add
14:17
up and then when you look at a school
14:20
level or a system level and the large
14:22
number of students and families this is
14:25
impacting that's where you start to see
14:26
that this is having a huge impact on
14:28
educ
14:31
[Music]
14:34
we'll be right
14:36
[Music]
Implications
14:42
back so Sarah what is the implication of
14:45
so many kids missing school yeah so one
14:48
reason I think this is a helpful metric
14:51
is because absenteeism helps explain why
14:55
so many students across the country have
14:57
not caught up from their pandemic
14:59
learning losses so it's sort of both a
15:02
cause and a symptom if you're behind
15:05
academically you don't really want to go
15:07
to school if you don't go to school you
15:09
fall further behind academically and
15:11
then with mental health if you have a
15:13
lot of anxiety you may not want to go to
15:15
school but then not going can fuel your
15:18
anxiety even more so it's all like
15:20
really interrelated and looking at this
15:23
gives us a clear picture of the
15:24
challenges facing schools right now and
15:27
part of why this is so relevant is
15:29
because absenteeism has impacts beyond
15:33
the students who are absent themselves
15:35
so not only is it bad for their
15:37
academics there's research that shows
15:39
that when classmates are absent it can
15:42
negatively harm the academics of even
15:44
the students who do show up because the
15:47
teacher has to sort of adjust their
15:49
curriculum and slow down a bit to make
15:51
sure that everyone's on the same page
15:54
and then there's other research that
15:56
shows that absenteeism is culturally
15:58
contagious
15:59
on a given day if at least 10% of your
16:02
classmates are absent you are then more
16:05
likely to be absent the following day so
16:08
we've talked a lot about the negative
16:09
impacts of missing school and this kind
16:12
of Doom Loop if you will and school in
16:15
many ways is about more than just the
16:17
academics right so what are kids missing
16:20
out on apart from this crucial time of
16:23
learning yeah I mean school is like
16:26
where you get prepared for social life
16:28
and and work life and society and so
16:30
beyond the academics like there's a lot
16:32
that goes into school for very young
16:34
students who were very young during the
16:37
pandemic there's the element of learning
16:39
to stand in line for the bathroom
16:40
learning how to hold a pencil learning
16:42
to share like these are all things that
16:44
kids are learning in school and for
16:46
older students there's like learning to
16:49
engage with the world in a way that
16:51
you're going to have to do as an adult
16:53
in the workforce so one thing that
16:54
really stuck out to me is I talked to a
16:56
school counselor who told me like the
16:59
kids at her High School got so used to
17:01
just Googling Solutions during the
17:04
pandemic that they have a lot of anxiety
17:06
around taking a test they don't know the
17:08
answers to or having a difficult
17:10
conversation with the teacher and so
17:12
those social skills those practicing of
17:15
awkward encounters or just like
17:18
acknowledging when you don't know
17:19
something and having to have a
17:20
conversation with someone else that you
17:22
then use in the workforce and your adult
17:24
life like school is where we practice
17:26
all of these things so so when experts
17:30
project out into the long-term effects
17:31
of all of this what are they worried
17:34
about I mean as a nation we're concerned
17:37
with whether students are catching up
17:39
from the pandemic we saw historic losses
17:42
during the pandemic particularly in math
17:45
and the federal government has poured
17:47
billions of dollars into helping schools
17:49
catch up but if students are not there
17:52
they cannot benefit from interventions
17:53
in order to catch up and so that has
17:56
impacts on our economic future as a
17:58
country as well as for the students
18:00
themselves in the system like when
18:01
you're in those early grades
18:03
establishing those daily habits of
18:05
attendance is crucial for your success
18:07
later on and in older grades you're
18:09
running out of time and so being
18:11
chronically absent to a serious degree
18:13
can be a predictor of Dropout or
18:15
disengagement from high school so all
18:19
age groups basically suffer and the
18:21
stakes are high I guess the next
18:23
question is how do we fix this are there
18:26
any solutions that you know of that are
18:28
actually working
18:29
yeah so there's lots of research out
18:32
there that you have to sort of tackle
18:34
absenteeism from multiple angles some of
18:37
the things we've seen that have worked
18:38
there are campaigns to text message with
18:41
parents or send postcards to their home
18:43
letting them know like how many absences
18:45
actually have been accumulated so far
18:47
that school year that has seen some
18:49
positive effects there's been some
18:52
research that tutoring can have a a
18:55
positive effect on absenteeism perhaps
18:57
because it helps people engage
19:00
academically and sort of interrupts that
19:01
cycle we were talking about and then
19:04
there's home visiting which has seen
19:06
some really promising results where
19:08
school districts are sending
19:09
Representatives out to connect with
19:11
families in their homes and find out
19:13
like why are you not going to school
19:15
what can we do to help
Interview
19:17
you hi it's Sarah at the New York Times
19:20
how are I actually spoke to a mom in
19:22
Michigan who received one of these
19:25
visits so tell me about you what is your
19:28
name where do do you live tell me a
19:29
little bit about your family her name's
19:32
Regina murf I is myself and I have four
19:35
children I have two that are grown and
19:37
moved out she has two School AG kids my
19:41
six-year-old and 12-year-old that are
19:42
with me and they're both boys and
19:44
they're attending Ipsy Community Schools
19:47
and during the pandemic she was working
19:50
at a nursing home so she had sort of a
19:52
lot of virus exposure and I I lost my
19:55
younger sister that kind of put me in a
19:58
in a
19:59
mindset um and she lost her sister to
20:02
covid-19 and I feel like that that's
20:05
when things kind of fell apart in a
20:06
sense and she was just sort of
20:09
struggling with my six-year-old you know
20:12
um in the you know in the morning I try
20:14
to make sure I have everything together
20:16
because if you're missing a shoe or if
20:18
you're missing simple items it's like
20:21
you know it kind of a a domino effect I
20:24
would say parents know like sometimes
20:26
the mornings can be rough when you're
20:27
trying to get your kids to school and
20:29
then ends up missing the bus I I'll say
20:32
like oh just forget we'll try again
20:33
tomorrow and it was just harder to get
20:36
her kids to school in the morning early
20:38
enough to make the bus and then this
20:40
like um the fear of sickness sitting my
20:43
kids out there will they get sick I
20:45
don't want anything to happen to them
20:47
it's a lot of fears it was a lot of
20:49
fears there and so her kids started to
20:51
miss a good amount of school and then
20:54
someone came to my house and they um you
20:57
know just told me that they will worried
20:58
about the attendance and how and
21:00
eventually she got a visit and I how do
21:02
they make you feel to have someone come
21:04
out and ask you about that I mean a part
21:07
of you kind of is embarrassed but um it
21:11
was refreshing to know that I had those
21:14
options to be able to reach out to them
21:16
he did the way that she described it to
21:18
me like she was a little embarrassed but
21:20
she also felt a little bit less alone
21:23
she was going through a hard time in her
21:24
life and so this home visit helped
21:27
reestablish the relationship with school
21:30
helped make her more aware of you know
21:32
how many absences her kids had
21:34
accumulated helped her maybe make more
21:37
of an effort on the mornings when it is
21:39
hard to get them to school because she
21:40
knows there's going to be other times
21:42
when they'll have to miss because they
21:44
really are sick so it's this kind of
21:47
direct intervention a personal
21:49
intervention that maybe has the hope of
21:51
rebuilding the connection the broken
21:54
connection often between parents kids
21:56
and schools that we've seen since pmic
21:59
yeah I mean I don't think it's the only
22:01
way but it speaks to something that's
22:02
really critical you know schools have
22:04
always been sort of the center of
22:07
American life and the center of
22:08
neighborhoods they're supposed to be
22:10
places of community places of
22:12
relationships friendships and so
22:14
reestablishing that connection is really
22:17
important to helping students and
22:19
families feel like there's reason to go
22:21
to school and I think by all indications
22:24
things are slowly getting better but not
22:28
like we're not back to prepandemic
22:29
levels and and this school year is going
22:31
to be critical when we see the data from
22:33
this school year what is it going to
22:35
show I mean in interviews I'm talking to
22:37
Educators who are telling me you know at
22:40
least in their school like it's
22:41
continuing to some degree this school
22:43
year so I think there's some evidence
22:45
that while things are getting better you
22:46
know very slowly by you know as time
22:48
goes on something has changed
22:53
fundamentally you know when you think
22:55
back to all of those different reasons
22:56
that families are
22:59
and why kids are missing school they're
23:01
pretty diverse like there's a bunch of
23:03
different reasons but the sort of Core
23:05
theme that underlies them is this shift
23:09
and this mindset that school is now
23:12
optional and that mindset took root
23:15
during the pandemic and that was the
23:17
lived experience for many families
23:19
school like it was optional to attend
23:20
school in person when school shut down
23:23
that broke the daily norm and it severed
23:26
a lot of famili Family Trust in the
23:28
education system that is supposed to be
23:30
a reliable place and then when schools
23:33
reopened like there were still options
23:35
there were sort of relaxed policies
23:37
around grading and attendance and so it
23:39
all sort of culminates in this like
23:42
cultural shift of school feeling
23:46
optional and I think that's something
23:48
that you see you know in society more
23:50
broadly if you look at remote work for
23:53
example the rate of remote work for
23:56
those who can work remotely has remained
23:58
about the same since late 2022 so that
24:02
seems to be here to stay that's a
24:04
long-term cultural shift brought about
24:06
by the pandemic and so this question is
24:09
like is that going to happen with
24:11
schools we saw that the pandemic
24:14
exacerbated and revealed all of the like
24:17
Beauties and flaws of our education
24:19
system students lost a lot of ground not
24:22
being in person so you can see on the
24:24
one hand what the value that schools
24:26
bring but then on the other hand it
24:28
revealed sort of all of the the flaws of
24:31
our imperfect public education system
24:33
and the flaws of of a system that's
24:35
pretty strained in terms of its
24:37
resources and its ability to serve all
24:41
students and then their increasing needs
24:43
they have more academic needs they have
24:45
more mental health and behavioral needs
24:47
and so you're sort of seeing that all
24:50
culminate in this
24:52
moment so in some ways the pandemic
24:55
crippled our school system and by doing
24:58
so it actually showed the essential role
25:01
schools play in society yeah and I think
25:04
also the essential role that
25:06
relationships and connection to one
25:07
another play in society and you know
25:11
today years out from the pandemic I hear
25:14
from teachers who are so exhausted and
25:16
feel so
25:17
underappreciated they're facing so many
25:19
challenges in their classroom I hear
25:22
from parents who feel failed in some
25:25
ways by the school system and like their
25:27
their kids are not getting what they
25:28
they need and so we're at this moment
25:30
where we're sort of at a
25:35
Crossroads will schools stay optional or
25:39
will we come together again can this
25:41
trust be rebuilt will schools be the
25:44
pillars in our community going

26:23
today Donald Trump has posted a $175
26:26
million bond that will prevent
26:29
authorities in New York from seizing his
26:31
assets including his best known
26:32
properties while he appeals a civil
26:34
court judgment against
26:36
him Trump owes New York more than $450
26:40
million after a judge found he and his
26:42
sons knowingly inflated the value of
26:45
their properties he was originally asked
26:47
to pay a bond in that amount an amount
26:49
he was having trouble securing and only
26:51
got the bond once it was later lowered
26:54
to $175
26:56
million if Trump loses his his appeal he
26:59
will still owe the full $450
27:02
million and Israeli air strikes
