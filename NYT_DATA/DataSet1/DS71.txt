Israelâ€™s Deadly Airstrike on the World Central Kitchen


0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael abaro this is a [Music]
0:10
daily the Israeli air strike that killed seven Aid workers delivering food in
0:16
Gaza has touched off outrage and condemnations from across the world
0:23
today Kim Severson on the pioneering relief group at the center of the story
0:29
and Adam rascom on what we're learning about the deadly attack on the group's
0:36
workers it's Thursday April [Music]
0:43
4th Kim can you tell us about the world Central Kitchen World Central Kitchen
0:51
started as a little idea in Chef Jose Andre's head he was in Haiti with some
0:58
other folks trying to do earthquake relief in 2010 and his idea
1:04
at that point was to teach Haitians to cook and to use solar stoves and ways
1:09
for people to feed themselves because the infrastructure was gone and he was cooking with some Haitians in one of the
1:15
camps and they were showing him how to cook beans the Haitian way you sort of
1:20
smash them and make them a little creamy and it occurred to him that there was something so comforting for those folks
1:26
to eat food that was from their culture that tasted good to them you know if
1:32
you're having a really hard time what makes you feel good is comfort food right and warm comfort food right so
1:38
that moment in the camp really was the seed of this idea it planted this notion
1:44
in Jose Andre's mind and that notion eventually became World Central
1:51
Kitchen and for those who don't know cim who exactly is Chef Jose Andre Jose
1:57
Andre is a Spanish Chef who cooked under some of the Spanish Molecular Gastronomy
2:03
grates came to America really made his bones in Washington DC with some
2:09
avangard food but also started to expand and cook Tapas cook Mexican food he's
2:14
got about 40 Restaurants now wow yeah and you know he's got a great Spanish restaurant in New York he's got restaurants in DC restaurants in Miami
2:22
come with me to the kitchen don't be shy he's also become a big TV personality
2:27
Chef are you going to put the Lobster in the pot with potatoes we're going to leave the potatoes the potatoes in one
2:34
of the most charismatic people I've ever been around in the food World delous he's very much the Touchstone of what
2:41
people want their celebrity chefs to be so how does he go from being all
2:48
those things you just described to being on the ground making local comfort food
2:56
for Haitians and how does this all go from an idea that that would be a good idea to this much bigger full-fledged
3:02
humanitarian organization so he started to realize that giving people food in
3:07
disaster zones was a thing that was really powerful he helped feed people
3:12
after Hurricane Sandy and he realized that he could get local chefs who all wanted to help and somehow harness that
3:18
power but the idea really became set when he went to Houston in 2017 to help after Hurricane Harvey and
3:26
that's when he saw that getting local chefs to tap into their resources
3:31
borrowing kitchens using ingredients that chefs might have had on hand or you know are spoiling in the fridge because
3:37
the power's out and all these restaurants needed something to do with all this food before it rotted
3:43
harnessing all that and putting it together and giving people well-cooked delicious at least as delicious it as it
3:50
can be in a disaster Zone that's when World Central Kitchen as we know it
3:55
today sort of emerged as a fully formed concept
4:04
the first pictures now coming in from Puerto Rico after taking a direct hit hurricane Maria slamming into the island
4:11
and as you heard one official saying the island is destroyed shortly after that
4:16
he flew to Puerto Rico where hurricane Maria had pretty much left the entire
4:22
Island without water and in darkness right he flew in on one of the first commercial jets that went back in he got
4:28
a couple of his chef buddies whose kitchens were closed and they just decided to start cooking they were
4:34
basically just serving pots of stew chicken stew in front of the restaurants the lines got longer and of course chefs
4:42
are a really specific kind of creature they really like to help their Community
4:48
they're really about feeding people so all the people who were chefs or Cooks on the ground in Puerto Rico who could
4:54
wanted to help and you had all these chefs in the states who wanted to fly
5:00
down and help if they could too so you had this constant flow of chefs coming in and out that's when I went down and
5:07
followed him around for about a week and what did you say well one of the most
5:12
striking things was his ability to get food to remote places in ways the
5:18
Salvation Army couldn't and other government agencies that were on the ground couldn't you know the Federal
5:25
Emergency Management agency FEMA doesn't deliver food it contracts with people to
5:30
deliver food so you have all these steps of bureaucracy you have to go through to get those contracts and then FMA says
5:37
you have to have a bottle of water and this and that in those boxes it's there's a lot of structure to be able to
5:43
meet the rules and regulations of FEMA so Jose doesn't really care about
5:50
rules and regulations very much so he just got his troops together and figured
5:56
out where people needed food he had this big paper m he'd carry around and lay
6:01
out and had a Sharpie and he'd Circle Villages where he'd heard people needed food or where a bridge was out and then
6:07
he would dispatch people to get the food there now how are you going to do that he was staying in a hotel where some
6:14
National Guard and military police were staying to go Patrol areas to make sure they were safe he would tuck his big
6:20
aluminum pans of food into the back of those guys cars and say could you stop and drop these off at this church during
6:27
that time in Puerto Rico he funded a lot of it off of his own credit cards or with cash and then he's on the phone
6:33
with people like the president of Goya or his golf buddies who are well connected saying hey we need some money
6:40
can you send some money for this can you send some money for that so he just developed this network almost overnight
6:47
I mean he is very much a general in the field you know he wears this Orvis
6:52
fishing vest has cigars in one pocket money in the other and he just sets out
6:57
to feed people and there were deliveries that were as simple as he and a couple
7:03
of folks taking plastic bags with food and waiting through a flooded parking lot to an apartment building where an
7:10
older person had been stuck for a few days and couldn't get out to driving up to a community that had been cut off
7:17
there was a church that was trying to distribute food we drive through this little Mountain Road and get to this
7:24
church we start unloading the food and the congregation is inside the the
7:29
church Jose comes in and the pastor thanks him so much and the 20 people or
7:35
so who were there gather around Jose and they begin praying and he puts his head
7:42
down he's a Catholic he's he's a man who prays he puts his head down he's in the middle of these folks and he starts to
7:48
pray with them and then pulls out his map circles
7:53
another spot and the group is off to the next place
8:03
[Music] and when Russia invades Ukraine he
8:10
immediately decided it was time for World Central Kitchen to step into a war
8:16
zone you know so many people needed to eat so many ukrainians were crossing the border into Poland there are refugees in
8:23
several countries surrounding Ukraine so a lot of the work that they did was
8:28
feeding the refugees they set up big operations around train stations places
8:34
where refugees were coming and then they were able to get into cities one of their operations did get hit with some
8:41
armaments early on nobody was hurt badly but I think that was the first time that
8:46
they realized this was an actually more dangerous situation than perhaps going
8:52
in after there's been an earthquake but the other thing that really made a
8:57
difference here is Jose Andre and World Central kitchen would broadcast on social media live from the kitchens in
9:04
the beginning he'd be holding up his phone and saying we put out three million meals for the people of Puerto
9:09
Rico chefs for Puerto Rico it was very infectious and now one of the standard operating procedures for people who are
9:16
in the world Central kitchens is to hold up the phone like that you can see the kitchen busy in the back and talk about
9:22
how many meals they've served you know they they have these kind of wild meal counts which one presumes are pretty
9:28
accurate but like we serve 320,000 meals this morning to the people of Lviv I
9:35
mean that scale seems important to know this is not the kind of work that feeds you know a few people in a few towns
9:41
when you're talking about 300,000 meals in a morning you're talking about something that begins it
9:48
would seem to rival the scope and the reach of the groups that we tend to
9:54
think of as the most important in the disaster relief World AB absolutely and
10:00
the meals there are lots and lots and lots of meals but also World Central Kitchen hires local Cooks they'll hire
10:06
food truck operators who obviously have no work and pay them to go out and
10:12
deliver the meals they'll pay local Cooks to come in and cook that's what they do with a lot of their donations
10:17
which is very different than other Aid organizations and this then helps the local economy he's trying to buy as much
10:23
local food as he can that keeps the economy going in the time of a disaster so that's a piece of his operation that
10:29
is a little different than traditional Aid operations so walk us up to October
10:36
7th when Hamas attacked Israel what does Chef Jose Andreas and the world kitchen
10:42
do well he had had such impact in Ukraine and I think the organization
10:49
itself thought that they had the infrastructure to now take food into another war zone Gaza of course was
10:56
nothing like Ukraine but World Central Kitchen shows up they're Nimble they start to connect with local chefs right
11:02
now they have about 60 kitchens in the areas around Gaza and they've hired about 400 Palestinians to help do that
11:10
but getting the food into Gaza became the difficulty how do you actually get
11:16
the food into the Gaza Strip large amounts of food that require trucks
11:22
you're going to realize getting food into Gaza right now requires going through Israeli checkpoints right and
11:27
that slows the operation down you might get eight trucks a day in and that is
11:32
such a small amount of food and this has been incredibly difficult for any Aid operations so World Central Kitchen
11:39
playing on the experience that they had in a war zone and working with government entities and trying to
11:45
coordinate permissions they took that experience from Ukraine and were trying to apply it in the Gaza Strip now they
11:51
had worked for a long time with Israeli officials they wanted to make sure that
11:57
they could get their food in and they decided that the best way to do it would be to take food off of ships get it in a
12:04
warehouse and then get that food into Gaza it took a long time to pull those
12:09
permissions through but they were able to get the permissions they needed and
12:14
set this system up so they could move the food fairly quickly into North Gaza
12:19
and once they get those permissions how big a player do they become in Gaza World Central Kitchen became a kind of a
12:26
fulcrum point for getting food Aid in to Gaza in a way that a larger and more
12:33
established humanitarian Aid operations couldn't in part because they were small
12:40
and Nimble in their way so the amount of food they were moving maybe wasn't you
12:46
know as large as some of the more established humanitarian Aid organizations but they had so much
12:52
Goodwill they had so much logistical knowledge they were working with local
12:57
Palestinians who knew the Food Systems and who understood how to get things in
13:02
and out so they were able to find a way to use a humanitarian
13:08
Corridor to have permissions from the Israeli government to be able to move
13:14
this food back and forth and that's always been the secret to World Central Kitchen is incredibly Nimble so just
13:20
like in Puerto Rico they seem to win over just about everybody and do the seemingly impossible right and World
13:26
Central Kitchen says they delivered 43 million meals to Gins since the start of the war and I don't think there was any
13:33
other group that could have pulled this off hey this is zie in she we're at the
13:40
J kitchen um and we've got the me on plus um tell us a little bit
13:48
about and then this Caravan this fairly
13:53
efficient Caravan of armored vehicles labeled with World Central Kitchen logo
13:58
on the roof on the sides the idea was they head on this humanitarian quarter they head on this road the seven people
14:05
who went all invest three of whom are security people from Great Britain you
14:10
have another world Central Kitchen employee who has handled operations in
14:16
Asia in Central America she's quite a veteran of the world Central Kitchen operation and you have a young man who
14:24
someone told me was like the Michael Jordan of humanitarian Aid who hooked up with World Central Kitchen in Poland he
14:31
was a Hospitality student and had just become an indispensable make it happen
14:36
guy mhm and you have a Palestinian gu 25 a driver so this is the the
14:41
team they have all the clearances they have the well-marked vehicles it seemed like a very simple
14:50
surgical kind of operation and of course now as we know
14:55
it was anything but that
15:03
[Music]
15:11
after the break my colleague Adam rascon on what happened to the world Central
15:17
kitchen workers in that Caravan we'll be right
15:23
[Music] back
15:31
So Adam what ends up happening to this Convoy that our colleague Kim serson just described from World Central
15:37
Kitchen so what we know is that members of the world Central Kitchen had been at
15:44
a warehouse in darl Bella in the central Gaza Strip they had just unloaded about
15:50
a 100 tons of food Aid that had been brought via a maritime route to the the
15:57
coast of the Gaza Strip when they Departed the warehouse they were in three cars two of the cars were armored
16:05
cars and one was a softskin car according to the organization when the cars reached the
16:12
coastal Road known as El Rasheed Street they started to make their way south and
16:17
what do we know about how much the world Central Kitchen would have told the Israeli military about their plans to be
16:25
on this road yeah so the world Central Kitchen said that its movements were coordinated and in military speak or in
16:34
technical speak people often refer to this as deconfliction so basically this process
16:40
is something that not only the world Central Kitchen but the UN telecommunications companies going out
16:47
to repair you know damaged telecommunications infrastructure others would use where they
16:53
basically provide the Israeli military with information about the people who
16:59
are traveling their ID numbers their names the license plate numbers of the
17:04
cars they'll be traveling in they'll sort of explain you know where their destination is and the general process
17:12
is that the Israelis will then come back to them and say you're approved to travel from this time and you can take
17:20
this specific route and do we know if that happened if the IDF said you're approved use this route on this night so
17:28
we heard from the world Central Kitchen that they did receive this approval the military hasn't come out and said that
17:35
it wasn't approved so I think it's fair to assume that their movements were coordinated and and DEC conflicted okay
17:42
so what happens as this seemingly pre-approved and coordinated Convoy trip
17:48
is making this leg of the journey they started to make their way south towards
17:55
Rafa and the three cars suddenly came under
18:02
Fire the Israeli Army unleashes powerful and devastating strikes on the three
18:08
cars in the Convoy most likely from a drone the strikes rip through the cars
18:17
killing everyone inside shortly thereafter ambulances
18:24
from the Palestine red crescent are dispatched the location they retrieve the Dead
18:31
bodies they bring those bodies to a hospital and at the hospital the bodies
18:37
are laid out and journalists start to report to the world that indeed five members of the world Central Kitchen
18:43
staff have been killed and the Palestine red crescent
18:49
teams were continuing to search for other bodies and eventually brought back
18:55
two more bodies to the hospital for a total of seven people killed in these air
19:07
strikes and when the sun comes up what does it end up looking like the scene of
19:12
these struck trucks from this Convoy so early in the morning when the sun comes
19:18
up a number of Palestinian journalists headed out to the coastal Road and
19:24
started taking pictures and videos and I received a series of videos from one of
19:30
the reporters that I was in touch with essentially showing three cars all
19:36
heavily damaged one had a world Central Kitchen logo on top of it with a gaping
19:43
hole in the middle of the roof a second car was completely charred you could
19:49
barely recognize the structure of the car the inside of it had had been
19:55
completely chared in the front smashed and do we know if the strike on this Convoy was the only strike happening in
20:02
this area in other words is it possible this Convoy was caught in some kind of a
20:09
crossfire or in the middle of a firefight or or does it appear that this was quite narrow and was the Israeli
20:16
Army targeting these specific Vehicles whether or not they realized who was in
20:21
it we don't have any other indication that there was another strike on that road around that time what that just of
20:29
course is that this Convoy was targeted now whether Israeli officials knew who
20:34
was in it whether they were Aid workers seems like a yet unresolved question but it does feel very clear that the trucks
20:42
in this Convoy were deliberately struck yes I do think the trucks in this Convoy were deliberately struck what is the
20:50
reaction to these air strikes on this Convoy and to the death of these Aid workers well one of the First Reactions
20:58
is is from the world Central kitchen's founder Jose Andreas Chef Jose Andreas
21:03
who founded World Central Kitchen calling them angels He said he was heartbroken and grieving and adding the
21:11
Israeli government needs to stop this indiscriminate killing and then he accused Israel of using food as a weapon
21:20
what I know is that we were targeted deliberately nonstop until everybody was
21:26
dead in this Convoy and he just seemed devastated and and quite angry and so
21:33
what is the reaction from not just World Central Kitchen but from the rest of the world to this air strike there's frankly
21:41
Fury and outrage the White House says it is outraged by an Israeli air strike that killed seven Aid workers in Gaza
21:49
including one American President Biden who has been becoming increasingly
21:54
critical of Israel's approach to this war he came out and said that he was outraged and heartbroken certainly
22:01
sharper in tone than we have heard in the past he says Israel has not done enough to protect Aid workers trying to
22:07
deliver desperately needed help to civilians incidents like yesterday's simply should not happen Israel also has
22:14
not and we're seeing similar outrage from foreign governments the British foreign secretary David Cameron uh the
22:21
Dreadful events of the last two days are a moment when we should mourn the loss
22:26
of these Brave humanitarian workers including said that the air strikes were completely unacceptable and he called on
22:33
Israel to explain how this happened and to make changes to ensure that Aid
22:38
workers could be safe so amid all this what does Israel have to say about the
22:45
attack about how it happened about why it happened the response from Israel this time was much different compared to
22:53
other controversial air strikes on the Gaza Strip often when were're reporting
22:59
on these issues we'll hear from the army that they're investigating a given incident it will take days if not weeks
23:07
to receive updates on where that investigation stands there are instances
23:12
where Israel does take responsibility for harming civilians but it's often rare this time the Prime
23:22
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comes out with a video message
23:30
saying that Israel had unintentionally harmed innocent
23:36
civilians and that was the first indication or public indication that Israel was going to take responsibility
23:43
for what had happened the IDF works together closely with the world Central
23:48
Kitchen and greatly appreciates the important work that they do we later
23:54
heard from the military's Chief of Staff hervy issued a video video statement in English I want to be very clear the
24:02
strike was not carried out with the intention of harming wck Aid workers it
24:10
was a mistake that followed a misidentification and he said this
24:16
mistake had come after a misidentification he said it was in the
24:22
middle of a war in a very complex condition but this incident was a grave
24:29
mistake we are sorry for the unintentional harm to the members of
24:35
wck he was clear that this shouldn't have happened I want to talk about that
24:40
statement because it seems to suggest that word misidentification that the Israeli Army
24:47
believed that somebody else was in this Convoy that it wasn't a bunch of Aid
24:52
workers that's possible although it's extremely vague and cryptic language
25:00
that genuinely is difficult to understand and it's a question that Us in the Jerusalem Bureau have been asking
25:07
ourselves I'm curious if the Israeli government has said anything in all of its statements so far about whether it
25:14
notice these markings on these three cars in the Convoy because that I think
25:20
for so many people stands out as making misidentification hard to understand it
25:27
seems like perhaps a random pickup truck could be misidentified as perhaps a vehicle being used by a Hamas Militan
25:35
but a group of world Central Kitchen trucks with their name all over it driving down a known Aid Corridor that
25:42
becomes harder to understand as misidentification yeah it's an important
25:48
question and at this moment we don't know exactly what the Israeli
25:53
reconnaissance drones could see and whether or not they were able to see in the darkness of the night the markings
26:00
of the world Central Kitchen on the cars but what is clear is that when the cars
26:06
were found in the morning right there was the big emblazened logo of the world
26:13
Central Kitchen mhm I'm curious how you think about the speed with which
26:20
Israel came out and said it was in the wrong here because as you said that's
26:25
not how Israel typically reacts to many of these situations and that makes me
26:31
think that it might have something to do with the nature of the aid group that
26:38
was the target of these air strikes the world Central Kitchen and its story I
26:46
think it does have to do with this particular group this is a group that's
26:52
led by a celebrity chef very high-profile who is gone run around the
26:58
world to conflict zones disaster areas to provide food Aid and I also think it
27:05
has to do with the people who were killed most of who were Western foreign
27:11
aid workers frankly I don't think we would be having this conversation if a group
27:18
of Palestinian Aid workers had been killed nor perhaps would you be having
27:24
the reaction that we have had so far from the Israeli government I would agree with that Adam at the end
27:31
of the day what is going to be the Fallout from all of this for the people of Gaza how do we think that this attack
27:39
on world Central Kitchen is going to impact how food medicine Aid is
27:45
distributed there so the world Central Kitchen has said that it's suspending
27:51
its operations across Gaza because it essentially seems that they don't feel
27:58
they can safely operate there right now in several ships that carried aid
28:05
for the organization which were sort of just on the coast those ships ended up
28:10
turning back to Cyprus carrying more than 200 tons of Aid so Aid That was
28:16
supposed to reach the people of Gaza is now leaving Gaza because of this attack
28:22
yes and it's also had a chilling effect another Aid group named anera has also
28:29
suspended its operations in Gaza and it seems that there is concern
28:35
among humanitarians that other Aid groups could follow
28:42
mhm so in a place where people are already suffering from severe hunger
28:48
poor sanitation the spread of dangerous disease this is only going to make the
28:54
humanitarian situation which is already dire even worse [Music]
29:00
well Adam thank you very much we appreciate it thanks so much for having
29:08
me we'll be right [Music]
29:17
back here's what else you need to another day the magnitude 7.4 earthquake
29:24
that struck Taiwan on Wednesday has killed nine people injured more than
29:29
1,000 and touched off several landslides it was taiwan's strongest
29:35
quake in the past 25 years but in a blessing for the Island's biggest cities
29:41
its epicenter was off the Island's East Coast relatively far from population
29:46
centers like Taipei and the first patient to receive
29:52
a kidney transplanted from a genetically modified Pig has fared so well that he
29:58
was discharged from a Massachusetts Hospital on Wednesday just 2 weeks after
30:04
surgery two previous transplants from genetically modified pigs both failed
30:10
doctors say the success of the latest surgery represents a major moment in
30:15
medicine that if replicated could usher in a new era of organ
