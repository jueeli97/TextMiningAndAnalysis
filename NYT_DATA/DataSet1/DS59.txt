The Evolving Danger of the New Bird Flu



0:00
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
tavernes and this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:12
daily the outbreak of bird flu that is
0:15
tearing through the nation's poultry
0:16
Farms is the worst in US
0:19
history but scientists say it's now
0:22
starting to spread into places and
0:25
species it's never been before
0:28
[Music]
0:31
today my colleague Emily anthus
0:39
[Music]
0:40

0:47
explains it's Monday April

0:54
22nd Emily welcome back to the show
0:57
thanks for having me happy to be here so
1:00
Emily we've been talking here on the
1:02
daily about prices of things and how
1:05
they've gotten so high mostly in the
1:07
context of inflation episodes and one of
1:10
the items that keeps coming up is eggs
1:13
egg prices were through the roof last
1:15
year and we learned that this was
1:17
actually not just inflation that
1:20
something else was going on and it was
1:23
related to this Aven flu has been
1:28
surging in the United States States
1:30
you've been covering this tell us what's
1:33
happening yeah so I have been covering
1:35
this virus for the last few years and
1:38
the bird flu is absolutely tearing
1:40
through poultry flocks and that is
1:43
affecting egg prices that's a concern
1:45
for everyone for me and for my family
1:48
but when it comes to scientists egg
1:50
prices are pretty low on their list of
1:53
concerns because they see this bird flu
1:56
virus behaving differently than previous
1:58
versions have and they're getting
2:00
nervous in particular about the fact
2:02
that this virus is reaching places and
2:04
species where it's never been before
2:07
okay so bird flu though isn't new I mean
2:09
I remember hearing about cases in Asia
2:11
in the 90s remind us how it began bird
2:14
flu refers to a bunch of different
2:17
viruses that are adapted to spread best
2:20
in Birds Wild Water birds in particular
2:23
are known for carrying these viruses and
2:26
flu viruses are sort of famous for also
2:28
being shape shifters so they're
2:30
constantly swapping genes around and
2:33
evolving into new strains and as you
2:35
mentioned back in the 9s a new version
2:38
of bird flu a virus known as
2:40
h5n1 emerged in Asia and it has been
2:44
spreading on and off around the world
2:47
since then causing periodic outbreaks
2:50
and how are these outbreaks caused so
2:52
wild birds are the reservoir for the
2:54
virus which means they carry it in their
2:56
bodies with them around the world as
2:58
they fly and travel and and migrate and
3:01
most of the time these wild birds like
3:04
ducks and geese don't even get very sick
3:06
from this virus but they shed
3:09
it so as they're traveling over a
3:12
poultry farm maybe if they happen to go
3:15
to the bathroom in a pond that the
3:17
chickens on the farm are using or eat
3:20
some of the feed that chickens on the
3:21
farm are eating they can leave the virus
3:25
[Music]
3:26
behind and the virus can get into to
3:30
chickens in some cases it causes mild
3:33
illness it's what's known as low
3:35
pathogenic Aven influenza but sometimes
3:38
the virus mutates and evolves and it can
3:41
become extremely contagious and
3:43
extremely fatal in
3:46
[Music]
3:49
poultry okay so the virus comes through
3:52
wild birds but gets into Farms like this
3:54
as you're describing how have Farms
3:56
traditionally handled outbreaks when
3:59
they do happen
4:00
well because this threat isn't new there
4:03
is a pretty wellestablished playbook for
4:06
containing outbreaks it's sometimes
4:07
known as stamping out and brutally what
4:10
it means is killing the birds so the
4:13
virus is so deadly in this highly
4:16
pathogenic form that it's sort of
4:18
destined to kill all of the birds on a
4:20
farm anyway once it gets in so the
4:22
response has traditionally been to
4:25
proactively depopulate or cull all the
4:28
birds so it doesn't doesn't have a
4:30
chance to spread so that's pretty costly
4:32
for Farmers it is although the US has a
4:36
program where it will reimburse Farmers
4:38
for their losses and the way these
4:41
reimbursements work is they will
4:42
reimburse Farmers Only for the birds
4:45
that are proactively called and not for
4:47
those who die naturally from the virus
4:50
and the thinking behind that is it's a
4:51
way to incentivize Farmers to report
4:53
outbreaks early so okay lots of chickens
4:57
are killed in a way to manage these out
4:59
breaks so we know how to deal with them
5:02
but what about now tell me about this
5:04
new strain so this new version of the
5:07
virus it emerged in
5:09
2020 after the deadly outbreak of the
5:12
novel Corona virus authorities have now
5:14
confirmed an outbreak of the h5n1 strain
5:17
of influenza a kind of bird flu and
5:20
pretty quickly it became clear that a
5:22
couple things set it apart a bald eagle
5:24
found dead at carin's Cove has tested
5:27
positive for the highly contagious bird
5:29
FL this virus for whatever reason seemed
5:32
very good at infecting all sorts of wild
5:35
birds that we don't normally associate
5:38
with bird
5:40
flu he was kind of stepping and then
5:43
falling over and using its wing to ride
5:45
itself things like eagles and condors
5:49
and Pelicans we just lost a parliament
5:53
of owls in Minneapolis Yeah couple
5:55
high-profile nests and also in the past
5:59
wild birds have not traditionally gotten
6:01
very sick from this virus and this
6:03
version of the virus not only spread
6:06
widely through the wild bird population
6:08
but it proved to be devastating they're
6:10
washing up along the east coast of the
6:12
country from Scotland down to suffk we
6:15
were hearing about Mass die offs of
6:17
seabirds in Europe by the hundreds and
6:20
the thousands and the bodies of the Dead
6:23
dot the island wherever you look
6:27
[Music]
6:32
wow okay so then as we know this strain
6:36
like previous ones makes its way from
6:39
wild animals to farmed animals namely to
6:41
chickens but it's even more deadly
6:45
absolutely and in fact it has already
6:47
caused the worst bird flu outbreak in US
6:50
history so more than 90 million birds in
6:53
the US have died as a result of this
6:56
virus 90 million Birds yes and I should
6:59
be clear that that represents two things
7:01
so some of those birds are birds who
7:03
naturally got infected and died from the
7:05
virus but the vast majority of them are
7:08
birds that were proactively called what
7:10
it adds up to is is 90 million farmed
7:13
birds in the US have died since this
7:15
virus emerged and it's not just a
7:18
chicken problem another thing that has
7:21
been kind of weird about this virus is
7:23
it has jumped into other kinds of farms
7:27
it is the first time we've seen a bird
7:29
flu virus jump into US livestock it's
7:32
now been reported on a number of dairy
7:35
farms across eight US states and that's
7:39
just something that's totally
7:41
unprecedented so it's showing up at
7:44
Dairy Farms now you're saying that bird
7:46
flu has now spread to cows how did that
7:49
happen so we don't know exactly how cows
7:52
were first infected but most scientists
7:55
best guess is that maybe an infected
7:57
wild bird that was migrating shed the
8:00
virus into some cattle feed or a pasture
8:03
or a pond and cattle picked it up the
8:07
good news is they don't seem to get
8:09
nearly as sick as chickens do they are
8:12
generally making full recoveries on
8:14
their own in a couple of weeks okay so
8:16
no Mass calling of cows no that doesn't
8:19
seem to be necessary at this point but
8:22
the bad news is that it's starting to
8:24
look like we're seeing this virus spread
8:26
from cow to cow we don't know exactly
8:29
how that's happening yet but anytime you
8:31
see cow to cow or mammal to mammal
8:34
transmission that's a big concern and
8:37
why is that exactly well there are a
8:39
bunch of reasons first it could allow
8:42
the outbreak to get much bigger much
8:45
faster which might increase the risk to
8:47
the food supply and we might also expect
8:51
it to increase the risk to Farm Workers
8:53
people who might be in contact with
8:55
these sick cows right now the likelihood
8:58
that a farm fer who gets this virus
9:01
passes it on is pretty low but anytime
9:04
you see mammal to mamal transmission it
9:06
increases the chance that the virus will
9:09
adapt and possibly maybe one day get
9:12
good at spreading between humans to be
9:15
clear that's not something that there's
9:18
any evidence of happening in cows right
9:20
now but the fact that there's any cow to
9:23
cow transmission happening at all is
9:25
enough to have scientists a bit
9:27
concerned
9:31
and then if we sort of think more
9:34
expansively Beyond what's happening on
9:36
farms there's another big danger lurking
9:39
out there and that's what happens when
9:42
this virus gets into wild
9:45
animals vast populations that we can't
9:51
control we'll be right
9:55
back so Emily you said that another
9:57
threat was the threat of flu in wild
10:00
animal populations clearly of course
10:03
it's already in wild birds where else
10:05
has it gone well the reason it's become
10:08
such a threat is because of how
10:10
widespread it's become in wild birds so
10:13
they keep reintroducing it to wild
10:15
animal populations pretty much anywhere
10:18
they go so we've seen the virus
10:21
repeatedly pop up in all sorts of
10:23
animals that you might figure would eat
10:26
a wild bird so foxes Bob cats Bears we
10:31
actually saw it in a polar bear raccoons
10:34
so a lot of carnivores and scavengers
10:37
the thinking is that these animals sort
10:39
of Might stumble across a sick or dead
10:42
bird eat it and contract the virus that
10:45
way but we're also seeing it show up in
10:48
some more surprising places too we've
10:50
seen the virus in a bottlenosed dolphin
10:53
of all places wow and most devastatingly
10:57
we've seen enormous outbreaks in other
11:01
sorts of marine mammals especially sea
11:03
lions and
11:06
seals so elephant seals in particular in
11:10
South America were just devastated by
11:14
this virus last
11:15
fall my colleague aova mandil and I were
11:19
talking to some scientists in South
11:20
America who described to us what they
11:23
called a scene from hell of walking out
11:26
onto a beach in Argentina that is
11:29
normally crowded with chaotic living
11:33
breathing breeding elephant seals and
11:36
the beach just being covered by carcass
11:39
after carcass after carcass
11:42
God mostly carcasses of young newborn
11:45
pups the virus seemed to have a
11:47
mortality rate of
11:49
95% in these elephant seal pups and they
11:52
estimated that it might have killed more
11:55
than 177,000 of the pups that were born
11:57
last year so almost the ENT entire new
12:00
generation of this
12:02
Colony these are scientists that have
12:04
studied these seals for decades and they
12:06
said they've never seen anything like it
12:12
before and why is it so far reaching
12:14
Emily I mean what explains these Mass
12:17
die-offs there probably a few
12:19
explanations one is just how much virus
12:22
is out there in the environment being
12:24
shed by wild birds into water and onto
12:28
beaches the these are also places that
12:30
viruses like this haven't been before so
12:34
it's reaching elephant seals and sea
12:36
liines in South America that have no
12:38
prior
12:39
immunity there's also the fact that
12:42
these particular species these sea lines
12:44
and seals tend to breed in these huge
12:47
colonies all crowded together on beaches
12:51
and so what that means is if a virus
12:53
makes its way into the colony it's very
12:56
conducive conditions for it to spread
12:59
and scientists think that that's
13:01
actually what's happening now that it's
13:03
not just that all these seals are
13:04
picking up the virus from individual
13:07
birds but that they're actually passing
13:09
it to each other so basically this virus
13:12
is spreading to places it's never been
13:14
before kind of Virgin Snow territory
13:17
where animals just don't have the
13:18
immunity against it and once it gets
13:21
into a population packed on a beach say
13:23
of elephant seals it's just like a knife
13:26
through butter absolutely and and even
13:29
more extreme example of that is what
13:31
we're starting to see happen in
13:32
Antarctica where there's never been a
13:34
bird flu outbreak before until last fall
13:38
for the first time this virus reached
13:41
the Antarctic Mainland and we are now
13:44
seeing the virus move through colonies
13:47
of not only seabirds and seals but
13:50
penguin colonies which have not been
13:52
exposed to these viruses before wow and
13:56
it's too soon to say what the toll will
13:58
be but Penguins also of course are known
14:01
for breeding in these large colonies
14:04
probably don't have many immune defenses
14:06
against this virus and of course are
14:08
facing all these other environmental
14:11
threats and so there's a lot of fear
14:13
that you add on the stress of a bird flu
14:16
virus and it could just be a Tipping
14:18
Point for Penguins Emily at this point
14:21
I'm kind of wondering why more people
14:23
aren't talking about this I mean I
14:25
didn't know any of this before having
14:27
this conversation with you and it feels
14:29
feel pretty worrying well a lot of
14:32
experts and scientists are talking about
14:34
this with Rising alarm and in terms that
14:38
are quite Stark they're talking about
14:41
the virus spreading through wild animal
14:43
population so quickly and so ferociously
14:46
that they're calling it an ecological
14:48
disaster wow but that's a disaster that
14:52
sometimes seems distant from us both
14:55
geographically you know we're talking
14:57
about things that are happening maybe at
14:58
the tip of Argentina or in Antarctica
15:01
and also from our concerns of our
15:03
everyday lives what's happening in
15:05
Penguins might not seem like it has a
15:07
lot to do with the price of a carton of
15:09
eggs at the grocery store but I think
15:13
that we should be paying a lot of
15:15
attention to how this virus is moving
15:17
through animal populations how quickly
15:20
it's moving through animal populations
15:22
and the opportunities that it is giving
15:25
the virus to evolve into something that
15:27
poses a much bigger threat to human
15:29
health so the way it's spreading in wild
15:32
animals even in remote places like
15:34
Antarctica that's important to watch at
15:37
least in part because there's a real
15:39
danger to people here so we know that
15:42
the virus can infect humans and that
15:44
generally it's not very good at
15:46
spreading between humans but the concern
15:49
all along has been that if this virus
15:52
has more opportunities to spread between
15:54
mammals it will get better at spreading
15:56
between them and that seems to be is
15:59
happening in seals and sea lions
16:01
scientists are already seeing evidence
16:03
that the virus is adapting as it passes
16:06
from Marine Mammal to Marine Mammal and
16:09
that could turn it into a virus that's
16:11
also better at spreading between people
16:14
and if somebody walks out onto a beach
16:17
and touches a dead sea lion if their dog
16:20
starts playing with a sea lion carcass
16:23
you could imagine that this virus could
16:25
make its way out of marine mammals and
16:28
into the human
16:29
population and if it's this mamalian
16:32
adapted version of the virus that makes
16:34
its way out that could be a bigger
16:37
threat to human health so the sheer
16:39
number of hosts that this disease has
16:41
the more opportunity it has to mutate
16:44
and the more chance it has to mutate in
16:47
a way that would actually be dangerous
16:49
for people yes and in particular the
16:51
more mamalian hosts so that gives the
16:54
virus many more opportunities to become
16:57
a specialist in mammals instead of a
16:59
specialist in Birds which is what it is
17:01
right now right I like that a specialist
17:03
in mammals so what can we do to contain
17:06
this virus well scientists are exploring
17:09
new options there's been a lot of
17:11
discussion about whether we should start
17:13
vaccinating chickens in the US the
17:16
government USDA Labs have been testing
17:18
some poultry
17:19
vaccines it's probably scientifically
17:22
feasible there are challenges there both
17:24
in terms of logistics just how would you
17:27
go about vaccinating
17:29
billions of chickens every year there
17:31
are also trade questions traditionally a
17:34
lot of countries have not been willing
17:36
to accept poultry products from
17:39
countries that vaccinate their poultry
17:42
and there's concern about whether the
17:44
virus might spread undetected in flocks
17:47
that are vaccinated so as we saw with
17:49
covid the vaccine can sometimes stop you
17:52
from getting sick but it doesn't
17:54
necessarily stop infection and so
17:56
countries are worried they might
17:58
Unknowing import products that are
18:01
harboring the virus and what about among
18:04
wild animals I mean how do you even
18:06
begin to get your head around
18:09
that yeah I mean thinking about
18:11
vaccinating wild animals maybe makes
18:14
vaccinating all the chickens in the US
18:16
look easy there has been some discussion
18:19
of limited vaccination campaigns but
18:22
that's not feasible on a global scale so
18:25
unfortunately the bottom line is there
18:26
isn't a good way to stop spread in wild
18:30
animals we can try to protect some
18:32
vulnerable populations but we're not
18:35
going to stop the circulation of this
18:37
virus so Emily we started this
18:39
conversation with a kind of curiosity
18:42
that the daily had about the price of
18:43
eggs and then you explained the bird flu
18:46
to us and then somehow we ended up
18:49
learning about an ecological disaster
18:51
that's unfolding all around us and
18:54
potentially the source of the next human
18:57
pandemic
18:58
that is pretty scary it is scary and
19:01
it's easy to get overwhelmed by it and I
19:04
feel like I should take a step back and
19:05
say none of this is inevitable none of
19:09
this is necessarily happening tomorrow
19:12
but this is why scientists are concerned
19:15
and why they think it's really important
19:17
to keep a very close eye on what's
19:19
Happening both on farms and off Farms as
19:23
this virus spreads through all sorts of
19:25
animal populations one thing that comes
19:28
up again and again and again in my
19:30
interviews with people who have been
19:32
studying bird flu for decades is how
19:35
this virus never stops surprising them
19:38
and sometimes those are bad surprises
19:40
like these elephant seal die offs the
19:43
incursions into dairy cattle but there
19:46
are some encouraging signs that have
19:49
emerged recently we're starting to see
19:51
some early evidence that some of the
19:54
bird populations that survived sort of
19:56
early brushes with this virus might be
19:59
developing some immunity so that's
20:01
something that maybe could help slow the
20:03
spread of this virus in animal
20:06
populations we just don't entirely know
20:09
how this is going to play out flu is a
20:12
very difficult Wy Foe and so that's one
20:16
reason scientists are trying to keep
20:18
such a close attentive eye on what's
20:20
Happening
20:24
[Music]
20:31
Emily thank you thanks for having
20:34
[Music]
20:42
me we'll be right back
20:58
here's what else you should know today
21:00
on this vote the AER 366 and the ner 58
21:03
the bill is
21:04
passed on Saturday in four back-to-back
21:08
votes the house voted resoundingly to
21:11
approve a long-stalled package of Aid to
21:14
Ukraine Israel and other American Allies
21:17
delivering a major victory to President
21:20
Biden who made Aid to Ukraine one of his
21:22
top priorities on this vote the yays are
21:26
385 and the NOS are 34 with one
21:30
answering present the bill is passed
21:33
without objection the house passed the
21:35
component parts of the $95 billion
21:38
package which included a bill that could
21:40
result in a nationwide ban of Tik Tok on
