An F.B.I. Informant, a Bombshell Claim, and an Impeachment Built on a Lie


0:03
see if we can do this do you want to
0:06
hear some of what I thought about it I
0:09
would like to hear that I'd like to hear
0:10
your thoughts on this episode yeah I
0:12
think this is a story about what happens
0:17
when intelligence and politics are
0:21
braided together and it's a story about
0:25
sources who sources are and how truthful
0:28
they are and how much they can be
0:30
trusted and intelligence is not really
0:36
what it sounds like intelligence is the
0:39
raw information claims mutterings that
0:44
the intelligence Community collects as
0:46
it tries to understand the
0:50
world the problem with
0:52
intelligence is that it's really
0:56
alluring and this is a story about what
0:59
happens when intelligence this thing
1:02
that should be closely guarded and used
1:05
by government officials to make
1:06
decisions is harnessed by politicians
1:10
for their political
1:12
[Music]
1:17
ends from The New York Times I'm Michael
1:19
babbaro this is the daily today Mike
1:24
Schmidt on how a single piece of
1:26
unverified intelligence became the
1:29
center piece of a republican attempt to
1:32
impeach President Biden and what
1:34
happened once that intelligence was
1:41
discredited it's Monday March
1:44
[Music]
1:50
4th so Mike if this is a story about a
1:55
piece of intelligence and its journey
1:58
through our government I think we should
2:00
start there with the piece of
2:03
intelligence and the story behind it as
2:07
you probably remember heading into the
2:10
2020 election Donald Trump rightly
2:13
identified Joe Biden as his biggest
2:16
political problem and he dispatched his
2:19
personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to dig up
2:22
dirt on the Biden family Giuliani went
2:26
to Ukraine he met with these officials
2:30
and figures there and he came back and
2:34
is basically like Joe Biden's son's
2:36
corrupt and Joe Biden is part of it and
2:40
made such a fuss that the Attorney
2:42
General Bill bar eventually asked a
2:46
United States Attorney in Pennsylvania
2:48
to essentially just deal with Rudy
2:51
listen to what Rudy has to say find out
2:54
if any of it is true and if it is pass
2:56
it along to the investigators who should
2:59
look at it
3:00
I remember all this it was not about
3:02
Hunter Biden so much as tying Joe Biden
3:06
his father to his son's alleged
3:10
corruption exactly and what we didn't
3:13
know at the time was that the US
3:16
attorneys
3:17
investigators went back and looked
3:20
through government files and they see
3:23
that years earlier an FBI
3:26
informan told his Handler that had a
3:30
contact at the Ukrainian Energy company
3:34
barisma where Joe Biden's son Hunter was
3:38
on the board on the board and very well
3:40
paid correct so that us attorney asks
3:45
that the FBI Handler go back and ask the
3:49
informant what he knows about Hunter
3:52
Biden and in
3:55
response the informant makes a very
3:57
salacious allegation which is what
4:00
he says that Hunter Biden and his father
4:05
each took $5 million in bribes from
4:09
barisma and in exchange for that money
4:12
Joe Biden in his position as vice
4:15
president at the time would protect
4:18
barisma from corruption investigations
4:21
by a Ukrainian prosecutor in other words
4:25
Joe Biden took a politically motivated
4:28
bribe so this is the moment when this
4:32
piece of intelligence we're talking
4:33
about in this episode is born and it's a
4:37
bombshell that a senior American elected
4:41
official former vice president
4:44
has gone Rogue and taken money from a
4:47
foreign company asking him to protect it
4:51
I mean a genuinely shocking claim well
4:53
it's potentially a bombshell or it's one
4:57
person telling his FBI hand Handler
5:00
something he says he heard it's what one
5:03
informant relayed to the
5:05
FBI and this is really important what
5:08
we're looking at in this case is not
5:11
some polished product that's been vetted
5:14
and analyzed and put into the
5:16
presidential Daily Briefing what we're
5:19
talking about in this case is
5:22
information at the Bottom Rung of the
5:24
ladder for the intelligence Community
5:27
this is raw Source reporting that rolls
5:29
into the country's law enforcement and
5:31
intelligence agencies from its sources
5:34
and informance it's something more akin
5:36
to rumor than a corroborated piece of
5:39
Intel got it so what ends up happening
5:42
to this piece of
5:44
intelligence what happens is that that
5:47
us attorney who was sifting through
5:49
these allegations about Hunter Biden
5:53
closes his inquiry and sends the bribery
5:58
allegation information
6:00
to another United States Attorney in
6:03
Delaware who was investigating whether
6:06
Hunter Biden should be charge for his
6:08
taxes his purchase of a gun and his
6:11
foreign business
6:12
dealings and this is a big black hole in
6:15
the story we don't know what happens
6:17
with this information other than the
6:19
fact that it sits in the FBI's files and
6:24
then Biden wins the presidency and
6:27
Republicans who want to take down on the
6:29
president and are still seeking Revenge
6:32
from the two impeachments of trump want
6:35
to find a link between Joe and his son
6:38
but they can't and that's the case for
Chuck Grassley
6:42
three long
6:43
years until late last spring senator
6:47
from Iowa when Chuck Grassley the
6:49
senator from Iowa goes to the floor
6:52
thank you Mr President and in multiple
6:55
speeches he says that whistleblowers
6:58
have approached his office office to
7:00
tell him that the FBI has very damaging
7:04
allegations on the Biden family the
7:07
allegations my office has received are
7:12
very precise very direct and very
7:16
consistent Grassley says that this
7:19
information is documented in a form that
7:22
the FBI uses all the time called a 1023
7:26
the 1023 that I sought from the FBI
7:30
references a criminal scheme involving
7:33
then Vice President Biden and his
7:36
alleged receed of $5
7:39
million he says that politics has
7:43
infected the bureau and that this
7:45
information the FBI believes the source
7:48
to be credible which was given to the
7:51
FBI by a trusted informant it's not
7:54
being
7:56
investigated did the FBI follow Norm
7:59
noral investigative processes and
8:02
procedures or did they just sweep this
8:05
under the rug and Congress and the
8:09
American people need to see what this
8:12
document says quit playing games and
8:15
recognize who you work for you're not
8:18
working to protect the corporate
8:20
interests of the FBI you're working for
8:23
the American people I
8:27
yield and almost on
8:30
[Music]
8:32
Q the conservative media goes nuts with
8:36
it one of the FBI's top informants
8:39
reported an allegation that Joe Biden
8:41
took a $5 million bribe from a foreign
8:44
National in exchange for a policy
8:46
decision this was not just any
8:48
confidential human Source by the way now
8:51
it seems like that Source was highly
8:52
valued the new question is this is Joe
8:55
Biden still making good on the bribe and
8:58
we know the Democrat Party simply
8:59
doesn't care if Joe Biden took millions
9:01
and bribes there is no set of evidence
9:04
that will ever be strong enough ever to
9:07
get them to say enough so as Grassley is
The FBI
9:11
making these claims he and his allies in
9:15
the house subpoena the document from the
9:17
FBI there's a whole back and forth as
9:20
the FBI warns Congress look this is
9:25
unverified information that we have in
9:28
our files
9:29
we're not just going to hand this over
9:31
to you right but the Republicans keep
9:34
the pressure on the FBI they threaten to
9:37
hold the FBI director Chris Ray in
9:41
contempt if he doesn't give them the
9:42
document and in the face of that Ray
9:45
allows Congress to see a redacted copy
9:49
of the document that shows what the
9:51
informant told the Handler this feels
9:53
like an important moment because this is
9:55
the FBI taking unverified intelligence
9:59
and allowing it to enter the political
10:03
sphere I mean let's be honest the people
10:05
demanding this document are not members
10:08
of the House intelligence committee
10:09
trying to better understand us Ukraine
10:12
relations they are pretty
10:16
farri conservatives who are openly
10:20
seeking to find evidence against the
10:22
president and are doing this at the same
10:26
time that the FBI is saying look all
10:29
this document does is show what an
10:32
informant told a Handler it shouldn't be
10:35
seen as anything more than that okay so
10:38
what happens once these Congressional
10:40
Republicans get a glimpse of this
10:42
document they come out in like a aha
10:46
moment and say we've got Joe Biden
Impeachment
10:50
connected to his son's corruption this
10:52
is the biggest political corruption
10:54
Scandal not only in my lifetime but I
10:56
would say the past 100 years the
10:58
evidence is overwhelming we're not
11:00
talking about Republican partisan
11:02
Witnesses from some Far right-wing
11:04
conspiracy we're talking about FBI
11:06
informance trusted FBI informants coming
11:09
forth and by September with this bribery
11:12
allegation as the centerpiece that's why
11:15
today I am directing our house committee
11:18
to open a formal impeachment inquiry
11:21
into President Joe Biden Republicans
11:24
move ahead with an impeachment inquiry
11:27
into the president the American people
11:30
deserve to know that the public offices
11:33
are not for sale and that the federal
11:36
government is not being used to cover up
11:39
the actions of a politically Associated
11:42
family and it's important to note that
11:45
Beyond this bribery allegation the
11:48
Republicans don't have much we will go
11:52
wherever the evidence takes
11:54
[Music]
11:57
us
12:01
we'll be right
12:04
back so with the stakes of this Rising
FBI Informant
12:07
by the moment we're now talking
12:09
impeachment in the house how Mike do we
12:12
come to understand that this cacious
12:15
bombshell claim was not in fact true so
12:19
in the wake of the Republicans kicking
12:21
up all this stuff about the allegation
12:25
that us attorney in Delaware finally
12:28
goes and investigates it takes that
12:30
allegation of bribery that perhaps has
12:32
been sitting around his office and says
12:34
I'm going to figure out whether this is
12:35
real correct so working with the US
12:38
attorney the FBI Handler goes back to
12:41
the informant to talk about the
12:44
allegation to see what else is there
12:47
okay and the justice department starts
12:50
to have doubts about the accuracy of his
12:53
story why what explains that well let me
12:56
tell you a little bit about who the
12:58
informant is okay the informant is a guy
13:01
in his early 40s named Alexander smof
13:05
he's been living in the US and he's been
13:07
an FBI informant for over a decade m in
13:11
that role he's provided information to
13:13
the bureau that led to criminal
13:16
investigations and even more he's
13:19
received special dispensation from the
13:22
FBI to go out and conduct criminal
13:26
activity as he gets information for this
13:28
Bureau okay so he's a valuable Source
13:32
why does the justice department suddenly
13:34
have doubts about him because his story
13:37
is not holding up to scrutiny smaroff
13:40
had said that he learned about the
13:42
allegation in
13:43
2015 or
13:46
2016 but he actually hadn't been talking
13:49
to anyone at burisma until
13:51
2017 after Joe Biden had left office as
13:55
vice president he also said he saw
13:58
footage of Hunter Biden entering a hotel
14:00
in Ukraine and that there were audio
14:02
recordings of Hunter talking about the
14:05
bribe but hunter hadn't been to Ukraine
14:08
at that point so these inconsistencies
14:11
were really alarming to the FBI and on
14:14
top of that the informant is telling his
14:17
Handler about how much he doesn't like
14:19
Joe Biden and how much Joe Biden's ties
14:22
to Ukraine are going to take down his
14:25
presidency and perhaps even more
14:27
troublingly the informant tells the FBI
14:31
that he's recently been in touch with
14:33
Russian intelligence officials who have
14:35
been feeding him their own information
14:38
including some on Hunter Biden in other
14:41
words the informant might be a Russian
14:44
asset might be doing the bidding of the
14:47
Russian government which has a long
14:48
history of trying to feed misinformation
14:51
into the American political system we
14:53
learned that of course in 2016 correct
14:57
so ultimately Mike what concl clusion
14:59
does the FBI and this us attorney draw
15:03
about this informant when they go back
15:07
and start finding all these
15:08
inconsistencies and problems that he
15:11
can't be trusted about anything and that
15:13
he fabricated the bribery claim H we
15:17
learn all this because something
15:19
extraordinary and unusual happens the
15:22
justice department just a couple of
15:25
weeks ago indict the informant for lying
15:28
to the FBI and now he's sitting in jail
15:32
awaiting trial H you said that arresting
15:36
this informant was unusual so why does
15:40
the US government charge the informant
15:43
what's unique here is that the
15:44
government usually doesn't charge
15:45
informant informants are not nuns and
15:49
Priests they're people that are playing
15:51
in the dirty parts of the
15:54
world sometimes they tell the truth
15:56
sometimes they shade it sometimes s they
15:58
make things up and in that at times are
16:02
really important kernels that the US
16:04
government has to learn about and if you
16:07
charge
16:08
informants you're going to deter other
16:10
informants from talking to the bureau
16:12
because they know oh man if I make a
16:15
mistake I too make get charge myself so
16:18
should we understand the fact that the
16:19
government charges this informant as
16:21
perhaps a measure of just how offended
16:25
they were by the nature of the lies he
16:28
told and based on the fact that it
16:30
contributes to an impeachment inquiry
16:33
the oversized impact that it had I don't
16:36
know but I think you might be right this
16:39
is something that was weaponized by a
16:41
political party and used essentially as
16:45
the centerpiece of an impeachment
16:48
inquiry and the weight of that lie the
16:53
importance of it was more than just your
16:56
average allegation mhm M and I don't
17:00
know that that is the reason that they
17:03
did this but certainly it's hard to not
17:05
think that it contributed to it in some
17:08
way Mike I think it's worth just pausing
Lessons Learned
17:11
and reflecting on what you just told us
17:15
because what the Journey of this piece
17:18
of intelligence tells us is that House
17:21
Republicans and to a degree Senate
17:23
Republicans Chuck Grassley took a single
17:26
strand of raw
17:28
intelligence that they had been told was
17:31
never verified and they ran with it in
17:35
the biggest way possible they made it a
17:37
centerpiece of their efforts to link a
17:40
sitting president with the foreign
17:43
business dealings of his son claimed it
17:46
represented corruption and they made it
17:48
the
17:49
centerpiece of their efforts to impeach
17:52
Joe Biden and now we know that the
17:57
government regards that information as a
18:00
fabrication and the informant who
18:02
delivered it as a serial liar that's a
18:05
pretty remarkable story it's
18:08
extraordinary and it's also not how the
18:11
system is supposed to work right
18:13
intelligence is not supposed to be
18:16
harnessed by
18:17
politicians to knock off their enemies
18:21
it's supposed to be there to inform
18:23
decision makers as they look at this
18:26
crazy big confusing world and try to
18:28
make the right call right so like you
18:32
said in every way this seems to be a
18:35
case study of how
18:37
intelligence is not properly handled in
18:41
our system and I and I wonder therefore
18:43
what the larger lesson of this is I mean
18:45
is it about picking better informance is
18:48
it about running
18:51
intelligence down better making sure you
18:54
figure out if something's true and don't
18:56
just lock it away in a file cabinet is
18:58
is it about never giving it to lawmakers
19:01
who could abuse it I mean what what is
19:04
the meaning of this story I think it's
19:07
about being humble to the fact that just
19:10
because one person said something
19:13
doesn't necessarily mean it's true mhm
19:16
and that when we hear things that
19:19
there's a bit of skepticism that not
19:23
everything that is recorded by the
19:25
government or said public is true and
19:30
that we have to have some humility to
19:33
the fact that this is a really complex
19:36
crazy world and not every disclosure
19:40
answers the major questions of the
19:42
moment and I think that in a time where
19:46
there's a ton of uncertainty people
19:48
grasp for these things and they try to
19:50
use them to make their point but at the
19:53
end of the day it may not be true so
19:56
that of course brings us to the question
19:58
of where this all leaves this
20:00
impeachment inquiry I mean the
20:01
foundation of it the missing link the
20:04
alleged Smoking Gun you know
20:07
evaporates and its source is branded a
20:10
Serial liar and fabricator by the US
20:12
government does that kneecap the
20:15
Republicans impeachment process the
20:17
Hardline Republicans have said this
20:21
indictment it's just the next part of
20:24
the coverup M it's just the next way
20:27
that the FB bi is doing the bidding of
20:30
the Biden crime family so you're saying
20:34
many of the Republicans who first relied
20:36
on this now false
20:39
intelligence are undeterred by the fact
20:42
that it has been branded fake by the
20:44
government and are now also claiming
20:47
that this
20:49
allegation was not that Central to the
20:53
impeachment inquiry but it was
False Intelligence
20:56
correct if you are a foreign government
20:59
who wishes America ill if you are Russia
21:02
you have to be watching all this and
21:04
kind of licking your chops right I mean
21:06
whether or not Russia fed this informant
21:09
misinformation about a bribe involving
21:12
Hunter and Joe Biden the Journey of this
21:15
piece of
21:16
intelligence
21:18
suggests that feeding misinformation
21:20
into our system is still a very reliable
21:24
way to wreak havoc in the United States
21:27
political
21:28
system it's not the first time we've
21:30
learned that lesson but it's an
21:32
incredibly Vivid example that it still
21:35
could do a tremendous amount of damage
21:37
it almost seems too easy for our
21:44
adversaries you think of intelligence
21:48
operations as these really complex
21:51
things that involve gadgets and double
21:54
agents but to get the United States
21:58
[Music]
21:59
ramped up and huffing and puffing and
22:02
impeaching its president you really just
22:05
need to feed one side something that
22:09
fits their narrative right and they
22:11
followed out the
22:17
window well Mike thank you very much
22:20
thanks for having
22:22
[Music]
22:26
me
22:29
we'll be right
Outro
22:35
back here's what else you need to know
22:38
day over the weekend Donald Trump won
22:41
three more nominating contests in
22:43
Michigan Missouri and Idaho doubling his
22:47
delegate count and making clear that his
22:49
last remaining rival Nikki Haley has no
22:53
real path forward so far Haley has won
22:57
just a single primary the District of
23:00
Colombia Trump is expected to officially
23:03
clinch the Republican nomination by the
23:06
end of the month and LeBron dribbles at
23:10

23:34
