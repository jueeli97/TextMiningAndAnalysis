The State of the Union



0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael babbaro
0:04
this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:10
daily on Thursday night President Biden
0:13
used the final State of the Union
0:15
Address of his first term to make his
0:18
case for a second term and to prosecute
0:21
his case against Donald
0:25
Trump today my colleague White House
0:28
reporter Jim tankersley walks us through
0:31
the biggest moments of the
0:36
speech it's Friday March
0:42
8th so Jim good evening and thank you
0:46
for staying up with us for what I have
0:49
always thought of as the Super Bowl for
0:52
nerds in Washington the State of the
0:54
Union absolutely although the Super Bowl
0:57
starts about 3 hours earlier
1:00
so it's in some ways a little easier
1:03
roughly around the same time right
1:04
roughly around the same time and has
1:05
commercials kind of fun commercials
1:07
which we didn't get here no no so it's
1:11
kind of impossible to separate this
1:14
state of the union from the moment in
1:17
which it's being delivered which is the
1:20
start of a general election campaign for
1:22
president that has started so much
1:25
faster than I think anyone had expected
1:27
in this case the speech comes just a day
1:30
after Donald Trump's last rival drops
1:31
out of the race the Republican primary
1:34
is now over and the race for the White
1:36
House is officially Whitted down now to
1:38
Trump versus Biden and it's at this
1:41
moment that President Biden delivers
1:44
this state of the union so with all that
1:47
in mind what heading into this night gym
1:50
do we understand to be Biden's Mission
1:54
with this speech the timing makes this
1:57
speech extraordinary sort of his
1:59
historically I think we can
2:01
overemphasize the importance of State of
2:03
the Union speeches sometimes but not
2:05
this one this is definitely one of the
2:07
most important speeches Joe Biden has
2:09
given as president if not the most
2:11
important thus far and it's important
2:14
because he's not winning this race the
2:17
polls do not show him beating Donald
2:20
Trump right now and it shows massive
2:24
headwinds facing his re-election
2:26
campaign voters do not approve of the
2:29
job he's doing as president they think
2:31
he is too old and they do not buy what
2:34
he is selling on his policy record right
2:37
now so Biden comes into this speech
2:40
wanting to reset all of those these are
2:42
his goals he wants to tell some new
2:45
stories about policy about the economy
2:47
about abortion about foreign policy that
2:49
make him look a lot better he wants to
2:52
draw contrasts with Trump that make
2:55
Biden look more likable and more
2:57
preferable to Trump than voters had been
3:00
thinking coming into the speech and
3:02
maybe most importantly he wants to
3:04
dispel or at least quiet these concerns
3:07
about his age by showing himself to be
3:10
sort of a vigorous Joe Biden who's up
3:12
for the job okay with all that in mind
3:15
walk us through the speech itself and
3:18
how Biden sought to navigate all of
3:22
these issues and challenges he faces
3:25
it's a really interesting
3:28
start go Joe
3:32
Joe Mr Speaker the president of the
3:35
United
3:39
States he kicks off with a joke he hears
3:42
all the Applause and says good
3:45
evening if I were smart I'd go home
3:50
now and then from that moment of levity
3:53
he pivots quickly into a very serious
3:55
section when he lays out threats to
3:59
democracy and freedom abroad and at
4:03
home Putin of Russia is on the March
4:06
invading Ukraine and sowing chaos
4:08
throughout Europe and Beyond he starts
4:11
with the war in Ukraine and with Russian
4:14
President Vladimir Putin and he talks
4:16
about him he Compares him basically to
4:18
Hitler on the march in Europe if anybody
4:21
in this room thinks Putin will stop at
4:23
Ukraine I assure you he will not and
4:26
casts America and the Biden presidency
4:29
at crucial to stopping this March and
4:33
then he tosses in what will be a real
4:37
sign of what's to come which is his
4:39
first swipe at Donald Trump now my
4:44
predecessor a former Republican
4:46
president tells Putin quote do whatever
4:49
the hell you
4:51
want that's a quote he quotes him and
4:55
accuses him of bowing down to I think
4:59
it's out rageous it's dangerous and it's
5:04
unacceptable from Russia Biden jumps to
5:07
the United States and he's continuing to
5:10
build sort of this case against Trump
5:12
history is
5:14
watching just like history watched three
5:16
years ago on January
5:18
6th now he starts talking about the
5:21
January 6th riots at the capital many of
5:24
you are here on that darkest of days we
5:28
all saw with our own eyes
5:30
the insurrectionists were not Patriots
5:33
they'd come to stop the peaceful
5:34
transfer of power to over Stern the will
5:36
of the people he calls it the greatest
5:39
threat to US democracy since the Civil
5:41
War this is the moment to speak the
5:43
truth and to bury the lies and he says
5:46
that Trump tried to bury the truth you
5:49
can't love your country only when you
5:53
win the subtext here is hard to mess
5:56
Biden is saying Trump is a threat to
5:58
democracy in Europe
6:00
and to democracy in the United
6:02
States right and it becomes clear around
6:04
this moment that this is going to be a
6:06
state of the union that has a lot to do
6:10
with Donald Trump yeah Donald Trump is
6:13
like the unnamed main character in this
6:16
speech when you talk to Biden AIDS and
6:19
his allies they are all a little bit or
6:22
a lot mystified at what they see As
6:24
Americans sort of almost Amnesia about
6:27
Trump not just sort of the chaos
6:30
of the years that Trump was president
6:31
but also the effects of his policies
6:34
they think people are sort of
6:34
remembering him overly nostalgically in
6:38
a way that Biden clearly sets out in
6:40
this speech to try to change and the
6:43
next way he does that after this riff
6:45
about democracy is by talking about
6:47
abortion and reproductive Freedom like
6:50
most Americans I believe R We R got it
6:52
right he talks about how roie Wade in
6:56
Biden's view was correctly decided but a
6:59
Supreme Court with justices appointed by
7:01
Trump overturned it which he knows
7:04
Americans in the polling largely do not
7:06
like he's the reason was overturned and
7:09
he brags about it look at the chaos that
7:13
has resulted and then he talks about
7:15
that leading to further erosion of
7:17
reproductive freedoms including the
7:20
recent Alabama decision about IVF many
7:22
of you in this chamber and my
7:24
predecessor are promising to pass a
7:26
national ban on reproductive Freedom my
7:29
God what Freedom else would you take
7:31
away and there there's this sort of
7:33
extraordinary moment where he turns to
7:37
the members of the Supreme Court who are
7:39
there at the speech it's not all of them
7:41
but it's several of them and tells them
7:44
with all due respect justices women are
7:46
not without electoral electoral
7:49
power excuse me electoral or political
7:52
power you're about to realize just how
7:54
much you about basically hey you're
7:58
underestimating women you're
7:59
underestimating what you have wrought
8:02
with your decision striking down
8:04
row right and it's actually in this
8:07
moment of him speaking to the justices
8:10
that he becomes his most overtly kind of
8:14
campaign he actually says that in
8:18
2024 women will show their power and and
8:23
in that moment I certainly felt like
8:25
this was going to be not just a state of
8:27
the union that was unusually focused on
8:29
his rival but that was unusually open in
8:33
the way that it was about his
8:35
presidential campaign yes and then Biden
8:39
turns to the economy where he really has
8:41
sort of a big task but also he thinks a
8:44
big opportunity to try to change the way
8:47
Americans think about Biden and Biden's
8:50
record it doesn't make new but news in a
8:53
thousand cities and towns the American
8:55
people are writing the greatest comeback
8:56
story never told
8:59
he's sort of retelling the story of the
9:02
country's recovery from the pandemic
9:05
recession and trying to cast himself
9:07
this time not as the villain who
9:09
Unleashed inflation that Americans are
9:11
angry about but as the hero who has
9:14
created a recovery that's the Envy of
9:16
the world America's comeback is building
9:18
the future of American possibilities
9:20
building an economy from the middle out
9:22
and the bottom up not to top down and he
9:24
starts telling the story running through
9:27
all the ways in which his
9:30
helped the economy the racial wealth Gap
9:32
is as small as it's been in 20 years
9:35
wages keep going up inflation keeps
9:36
coming down inflation has dropped from
9:39
9% to 3% the lowest in the world and
9:42
tending
9:43
lower and I got to tell you Michael I I
9:46
covered this stuff every day I know this
9:48
stuff really well Biden starts going so
9:51
fast and sort of so animatedly that it
9:55
was hard for me to keep up and now
9:57
instead of a porting importing foreign
9:59
products and exporting American jobs
10:02
we're exporting American products and
10:04
creating American jobs and it takes him
10:07
a while to sort of settle down and kind
10:10
of relax into the speech but in these
10:13
economic Parts in particular he's just
10:14
at times just flying through well you
10:17
know I don't think that was an accident
10:19
and I think it speaks to one of the
10:22
things you said about what Biden's goal
10:24
was tonight which was to be energetic I
10:27
mean there were moments during the
10:29
speech I was listening in the same pair
10:30
of headphones I'm listening to you in
10:32
where I had to lower the volume and kind
10:33
of take my headphones off because Biden
10:36
was almost yelling and it felt like that
10:39
was a deliberate effort by the president
10:41
to say I am so very present and here for
10:47
this speech yeah absolutely and the
10:50
times when he really seemed to relax
10:53
into it were the times when he kind of
10:55
broke character almost or broke from the
10:58
text and needled the Republicans in the
11:00
crowd 46,000 new projects have announced
11:03
all across your communities and by the
11:05
way I noticed some of you strongly voted
11:07
against it or they're cheering on that
11:09
money coming in so this happens really
11:11
early on he's talking about investments
11:14
from his infastructure law that have
11:16
gone to communities all across the
11:17
country and which as Biden loves to note
11:20
include Investments that have been
11:21
celebrated by some Republican members of
11:23
Congress who didn't vote for the law if
11:26
any of you don't want that money in your
11:27
District just let me know
11:30
throughout the speech though especially
11:33
once he settles down Biden talks about a
11:36
ton of economic policy and it's very
11:39
strategic what he chooses to talk about
11:42
and I want to make sure the college is
11:43
more
11:45
affordable let's continue increasing the
11:48
pel grants to working in Middle Class
11:49
families and increase record investments
11:52
in
11:53
HBCU he targets young voters who
11:57
Democrats are really worried about when
11:58
winning in large numbers in this
12:00
election by talking about his efforts to
12:03
forgive student loan debt and by
12:05
proposing new ways to help people who
12:07
are buying homes often for the first
12:09
time because housing costs are a huge
12:12
worry among young voters I want to
12:14
provide an annual tax credit that will
12:16
give Americans $400 a month for the next
12:19
two years as mortgage rates come down to
12:22
put toward their mortgages when they buy
12:24
not all of his Economic Policy here is
12:26
aimed at young voters some of it is much
12:27
more Universal but even the universal
12:29
stuff has some real appeals to young
12:32
people in a way that Joe Biden relates
12:35
to them most notably snack food you
12:37
probably all saw that commercial on
12:40
Snickers
12:41
bars you get you get charge the same
12:44
amount and you got about I don't know
12:46
10% fewer Snickers in it he talks about
12:49
shrinking Snickers bars as an example of
12:53
corporate greed that's pushing up prices
12:55
of things what economists call shrink
12:57
flation same size bag put fewer chips in
13:01
it no I'm not joking it's called Shing
13:04
and this is like a a way for him to move
13:07
from tangible concerns of young people
13:09
into another big economic narrative he's
13:12
trying to tell which is Joe Biden wants
13:14
to raise taxes on corporations and kind
13:16
of wants to stick it to Big corporations
13:19
that he thinks aren't paying their fair
13:20
share and Donald Trump again unnamed but
13:24
very much a main character is the guy
13:26
who cut corporate taxes and by is trying
13:29
to paint him as sympathetic to the
13:31
interest of the wealthy and big
13:32
companies over the interests of working
13:34
people including young workers the
13:37
working people who built this country
13:39
pay more into Social Security than
13:41
Millionaires and billionaires do it's
13:43
not fair we have two ways to go
13:47
Republicans can cut Social Security and
13:49
give more tax breaks to the wealthy I
13:52
will that's the
13:54
proposal oh no Republicans by the way do
13:58
not take all of these Biden narrative
14:01
reframings sitting down they get more
14:04
and more agitated and start to Heckle
14:05
him it it leads to this much more rockus
14:08
feeling of the speech as the speech goes
14:11
on and they really start to have some
14:14
back and forths with Biden from the
14:17
lecturn none as sort of stunning as what
14:22
happens when Biden starts talking about
14:27
immigration
14:33
we'll be right
14:35
back so Jim tell us about the section of
14:38
the speech where Biden broaches
14:41
immigration well he is trying to
14:43
continue his effort to flip the script
14:46
on an issue that is unquestionably
14:48
difficult for him right now and he's
14:50
trying to do it by basically casting
14:53
himself as more serious about border
14:55
security legislation than Republicans
14:57
are and no remember my team began
15:00
serious negotiation with a bipartisan
15:02
group of senators he calls out House
15:06
Republicans for not backing a bipartisan
15:09
bill from the Senate the result was a
15:11
bipartisan bill with the toughest set of
15:14
border security reforms we've ever
15:17
seen oh you don't think so Republicans
15:20
boo him oh you don't like that bill huh
15:23
and Biden goes right back at them he
15:26
basically says oh what you don't this
15:29
bill conservatives negotiated this bill
15:31
mhm I'll be darn that's
15:34
amazing that
15:36
bipartisan and then he ticks through how
15:39
many more border security agents would
15:41
be hired and how many more immigration
15:42
judges and more Asylum officers so they
15:45
can resolve cases faster he talks about
15:48
how the Chamber of Commerce has endorsed
15:50
the bill on the border patrol Union and
15:54
Republicans are really starting to
15:55
Heckle him now I know you know how to
15:57
read and Biden says at this one point I
16:00
know you know how to read like you can
16:02
read the bill you know what's in it you
16:03
guys negotiated it he says you're
16:06
blocking this because it would be good
16:10
for the country but bad for Trump and
16:14
hey we can fight about fixing the Border
16:16
or we can fix it I don't think it's
16:19
about me or about Trump I think it's
16:21
good for America send me the Border bill
16:25
now right and here Biden is applying in
16:29
what has been up to this point a very
16:32
pointed critique of trump to the entire
16:36
Republican party as a source of kind of
16:40
blind partisan opposition to practical
16:44
Solutions and basically a source of
16:46
government dysfunction yeah and it's at
16:50
this moment Michael when the speech kind
16:52
of hops the track for a minute I'd be a
16:56
winner not real
17:00
[Applause]
17:02
I Biden gets interrupted by margorie
17:06
Taylor green margorie Taylor green is a
17:08
famously conservative
17:11
bombastic prot Trump Republican member
17:14
of Congress from Georgia and before the
17:17
speech even starts when Biden is walking
17:19
into the house chamber she hands him a
17:23
button with the name on it of leak Riley
17:27
a young n ing student who was killed at
17:30
the University of Georgia allegedly by
17:33
an undocumented immigrant right she
17:36
hands him this wearing a red Maga
17:39
reelect Trump hat and she says to him as
17:41
he's walking by say her name say her
17:44
name this has been the conservative call
17:46
say her name say her name Joe Biden is
17:48
denying they say violence committed by
17:53
undocumented immigrants mhm she starts
17:55
heckling him on this on this point when
17:58
he's in the immigration section of his
18:00
speech and Biden indulges her how
18:03
exactly Biden stops his speech and has
18:07
almost like a presidential version of a
18:10
screw it moment he takes the pin that
18:15
marjerie Taylor green handed him he
18:18
looks at her and he says the name
18:23
although he gets it wrong Lincoln
18:26
Lincoln Riley Lincoln Riley and then
18:28
young woman who was killed by an illegal
18:32
a young woman killed by an illegal which
18:35
is not a phrase that Democrats usually
18:39
use to talk about undocumented
18:43
immigrants and he says to her parents
18:45
that his heart goes out to them but then
18:48
he goes back into his talking points
18:49
about changing the dynamic of the border
18:51
to make things better and he turns it
18:54
right back on green and her colleagues I
18:56
would respectfully SE to suggest my
18:57
refriend my Republican friends owe it to
18:59
the American people get this bill done
19:02
we need to act now and says you owe it
19:05
to the American people to get this bill
19:07
done mhm and it's this amazing moment
19:11
right what do you make of it it was
19:12
definitely Off Script but I think it was
19:14
strategic M Biden had success in last
19:18
year's speech baiting Republicans on
19:21
Social Security and I think he came into
19:23
this speech hoping for some more
19:26
successful exchanges where he could turn
19:29
conservative and relatively unpopular
19:32
across the country House Republicans
19:34
into his foils and here he is trying to
19:37
do that he is strategically engaging
19:40
with margerie Taylor green on her terms
19:42
in order to try to make her the villain
19:46
in this new story he's telling you're in
19:49
the way you say you care about this but
19:51
you're in the way got it eventually
19:54
Biden turns to yet another hot button
19:57
issue of
19:58
very meaningful significance to him
20:00
electorally and that is the war between
20:02
Israel and Hamas in Gaza this is
20:05
something I think many of us had been
20:08
watching for from the start of the
20:10
speech and Biden Waits and is deep in
20:12
the speech when he gets there but then
20:14
he drops into something we really had
20:16
not seen to this point in the evening
20:20
which was kind of slow soft
20:23
compassionate Joe Biden and he kind of
20:26
gets the room suddenly really quiet
20:29
I know the last 5 months have been
20:31
gut-wrenching for so many people for the
20:33
Israeli people for the Palestinian
20:35
people you talks about knowing how
20:37
gut-wrenching the time since October 7th
20:40
has been for so many people for people
20:43
in Israel for the Palestinians for
20:46
Americans and then he gets to the 250
20:51
hostages who were taken by Hamas in that
20:54
attack I pledge to all the families that
20:56
we will not rest until we bring every
20:58
every one of your loved ones home we
21:01
[Music]
21:03
also by starting with the hostages what
21:06
Biden does is have a genuinely large
21:10
bipartisan Outburst in the room but then
21:14
he has to Pivot Israel has the right to
21:16
go after Hamas and he pivots into his
21:19
support for Israel and then he pivots
21:22
into how horrible the human conditions
21:24
are in Gaza more than 30,000
21:26
Palestinians have been killed
21:29
most of whom are not Hamas and laments
21:33
the deaths and promises more aid for the
21:36
families who are homeless and hungry and
21:39
without water the only real solution to
21:41
the situation is a two-state solution
21:44
over
21:46
time and then in the very end he pivots
21:49
back to sort of an admonition almost of
21:51
the Israeli government which has
21:53
rejected Biden's preferred end to this
21:56
entire thing which is a two-state
21:59
solution right and in all those pivots J
22:01
it feels like you can see a president
22:03
and a candidate for president who is
22:06
visibly struggling to figure out how to
22:09
manage all the constituencies in this
22:11
conflict yeah the way I would put it is
22:13
that you see a president who does not
22:15
have a magic solution that could make
22:18
everyone happy and that also comports
22:20
with his values right and you see him
22:23
trying to be responsive to changing
22:24
facts in the conflict but not coming
22:27
anywhere close to changing as fast as
22:30
many of his critics would want him to
22:32
finally Biden turns to the elephant in
22:35
the room arguably the trickiest subject
22:37
of all which is his age and physical and
22:40
mental Readiness to be a second term
22:44
president yeah listen if you cover the
22:46
White House even if you write mostly
22:48
about policy you've been lectured by
22:50
people in the White House about how the
22:51
media writes way too much about Biden's
22:54
age but at the same time the White House
22:56
is acutely aware
22:58
of how much of a problem Biden's age is
23:01
for him in the polls and this speech
23:04
turns out in the end to be a direct
23:06
acknowledgement of that and an attempt
23:08
just like with so many other things to
23:10
change the narrative mhm I know it may
23:13
not look like it but I've been around a
23:15
while Biden takes the age issue head on
23:20
when you get to be my age certain things
23:21
become clearer than
23:23
ever I know the American story and then
23:26
he tries in sort of a Ronald reaganesque
23:28
fashion to sort of make his age into a
23:32
good thing an experience thing my
23:34
lifetime has taught me to embrace
23:36
freedom and democracy a future based on
23:39
core values that defined America honesty
23:43
decency dignity
23:45
equality to respect everyone to give
23:49
everyone a fair chop to give hate no
23:51
safe
23:52
haror and here is where he tries to use
23:56
his age and his story to relate back to
23:59
the narratives he's trying to tell about
24:03
policy and the country right now and he
24:07
ends by trying to contrast himself in
24:12
advancing age with Trump in advancing
24:16
age my fellow
24:19
Americans the issue facing our
24:23
nation isn't how old we are it's how old
24:26
are our ideas
24:29
hate anger Revenge retribution are the
24:31
oldest of ideas but you can't lead
24:34
America with ancient ideas only take us
24:37
back this is like a total critique of
24:39
trump he is saying Trump is like a
24:42
cranky old man shouting that he wants
24:45
things to go back to a way that they
24:46
were and about all the people he's angry
24:49
at and that Biden is trying to be this
24:51
Optimist who wants to take us forward
24:54
and unite the country You're the Reason
24:55
we've never been more optimistic about
24:57
our future than I am now so let's build
25:00
the future together let's remember who
25:02
we are we are the United States of
25:06
America and there is
25:09
nothing nothing beyond our capacity when
25:13
we act
25:14
together God bless you all and may God
25:17
protect our troops thank you thank you
25:19
thank
25:21
you in the end was this an effective
25:24
speech given all the burdens and
25:26
challenges that you outlined at the
25:28
beginning of our conversation did
25:30
President Biden rise to the occasion and
25:33
Will It ultimately matter well we'll
25:36
have to see what the polls show but I
25:39
think two things are important here
25:41
right away one is that in the time from
25:43
when the speech ended until we started
25:45
taking this episode I heard from a bunch
25:46
of Democrats who had been skeptical
25:48
about the president's ability to deliver
25:50
a speech with this level of energy who
25:52
were thrilled with it and I think on
25:55
that he's done an important part of his
25:57
job which is to reassure some parts of
25:59
his Coalition right but also there was
26:02
this rather extraordinary ad that a
26:04
group of trump supporters aired earlier
26:06
in the day that basically went straight
26:09
at Biden on his age it was a caricature
26:12
of a caricature of an old weak man
26:14
unable to get up the stairs let alone do
26:18
the job and implied that he wasn't going
26:21
to be able to finish out a second term
26:24
like live through it that is a low bar
26:27
to clear obviously for a guy giving a
26:30
speech to a joint session of Congress
26:32
but that's clearly not the guy who
26:34
showed up at the State of the Union that
26:35
is not the guy giving the speech he
26:38
coughed he stumbled he had some Joe
26:40
bidenisms that happened but he was not
26:43
an old frail man who couldn't walk he
26:46
basically closed the place down he hung
26:49
around talking to members of Congress
26:51
long after most of the networks had
26:53
turned off their cameras and he loved it
26:56
he was having a good time and he was
26:58
trying really hard to show the world
27:00
that hey like that caricature you saw me
27:02
is nothing like reality with all that
27:04
said it's almost impossible to reset
27:09
narratives and change the way people
27:11
view things in the span of one speech
27:14
right whether that's your performance in
27:15
the economy or your Fitness for
27:19
office and so now we're going to see in
27:21
the span of an actual campaign over the
27:23
next several months a campaign that
27:25
started in Earnest this week
27:28
whether Biden can do this again and
27:29
again and again whether he can have the
27:32
repetition and the Repeat Performance
27:35
that he needs to convince voters that
27:37
hey these narratives you should rethink
27:39
them you should rethink me and you
27:42
should rethink my record and you should
27:43
give me another chance and reelect

here's what else you need to know today
28:10
lawmakers in Alabama have passed
28:12
legislation to protect providers of
28:15
invitro fertilization from a state
28:17
Supreme Court ruling that put many of
28:19
them at legal risk that ruling found
28:23
that Frozen embryos should be considered
28:25
children a finding that all but shut
28:28
down IVF across the state over fears
28:32
that damaging or destroying an embryo
28:35
could become a crime the new legislation
28:38
which was quickly signed into law by
28:40
Alabama's Governor seeks to ensure that
28:43
no legal liability exists as a result at
28:47
least one major provider of IVF in the
28:49
state resumed treatments almost
