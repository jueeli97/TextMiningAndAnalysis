0:01

0:08
daily last week the Russian authorities announced that Alexa navali the leader
0:13
of Russia's opposition movement had died in prison at the age of 47 navali was
0:19
Vladimir Putin's most audacious and Relentless critic his fight against corruption resonated far beyond liberal
0:26
Moscow and his Central message to Russians do not be afraid because our
0:32
fear is their power that was how navali lived his life thumbing his nose at
0:38
Putin's regime in the face of poisoning prison and ultimately
0:44
death today his friend yeva albatz on how Alexa naali became such a singular
0:51
political force and what it means for his country that he's [Music]
0:58
gone it's Thursday February [Music]
1:07
22nd can you hear me I can can you hear me oh good yes what's up you know lately
1:15

1:22
doing uh I don't know how to answer this question to go for you yeah I after the
1:29
death of Nal I called y alotz who goes bya she's a Russian journalist and
1:35
academic she studies political science she knew and worked with Nal for decades
1:41
she now lives in Exile in the United States I'm divided between two
1:47
languages I constantly think in English and in Russian and I constantly listen
1:54
to podcasts and YouTube shows in Russian and in English
2:00
and uh uh I think I live more inside Russia than I live inside the United
2:06
States except when you have your primaries and then I'm in New Hampshire
2:13
in South Carolina and I'm waiting for the super Tuesday so Jia tell me about the first
2:21
time you met Alexa Nali remember back for me where were you at that moment I
2:28
was in w it was 2004 I started uh teaching at University
2:36
as a professor of political science I thought that I was done with journalism so I
2:42
decided to collect you know the group of young politicians democratically
2:47
oriented young politicians and try to teach them grassroot
2:54
politics and so they started coming to my house in was go on this nice Street
3:01
each Tuesday there was some 20 young people okay I was cooking the Medina chicken
3:09
and potatoes and we were sitting around the table and we were discussing what can we
3:17
do the people who showed up to Jen's apartment many of them have since gone into Exile are been jailed in Russia but
3:25
back in those days they all came to talk about politics and figure out how to do
3:30
Grassroots organizing in Russia a country that had very little experience with that well started preparing R
3:37
protest R and one of the people who walked through her doors for one of those Tuesday get togethers was Alexa
3:43
naali and so he came he was 27 years old
3:49
back then he was tall handsome he was slightly
3:58
stoed he she had a bad haircut uh she had a beer belly a beer
4:06
belly
4:11
yes and J what was your first impression of him what did you think I mean remember back for me uh
4:20
smart very attentive very good in fulfilling tasks
4:27
and getting things done but n was not exactly very good
4:36
speaker when Jor first met navali he was working a desk job for an opposition
4:41
party Jena said he wasn't very happy and he wanted something more at the time he
4:46
wasn't the polished political leader that we know today great speech and mumbled something and I was watching him
4:52
I was thinking God it's so unfair he's so handsome so goodlooking he's a pure
4:59
Pol politician with this beautiful Slavic face but he's unable to speak but
5:05
she quickly realized he had promise when the two of them went out to canvas on behalf of a friend from those Tuesday
5:10
dinners who was running for local office in Moscow we came to speak to people in the
5:16
courtyard MH and they were babush you know grandmothers grandmothers exactly
5:23
and we were trying to ask them what are their concerns and they were resentful
5:29
they didn't want to speak to us you know who all these young people you know for asking them all this kind of ridiculous
5:35
questions and then I saw me who came
5:42
forward and he smiled and then he said some joke and he
5:51
helped one Grandma to get to the bench and he took another Grandma under her um
6:00
and he started talking and all of a sudden it was like a miracle all of them
6:07
they were listening to him they were looking at him they were totally in love
6:12
with him and that's when you know the first time when I I thought he's a born
6:19
politician that's his talent his amazing ability to get people on his side to
6:26
talk to them so he had Charmed these resentful grandmothers he don't just
6:34
Charmed you know he sort of he became their
6:39
son really who was capable to help them you know IAL had a lot of great
6:48
qualities in himself but he was lacking education and he himself realized that
6:55
pretty early in his life and then what Nani grew up in a military town outside
7:01
of Moscow Jen says that the schools he attended there were pretty bad with a narrow Soviet curriculum but navani was
7:09
hungry to learn if he was going to have a real political future in Russia he needed to do more than just charm
7:15
grandmothers in Courtyards and so in 2009 he had an idea
7:21
now came to my office and he said Jena I want to go to Yale univers
7:30
I really think I need to spend a year in the good University take
7:37
classes and he got into this world leaders program at H
7:42
University and person for mons he started all things related to American
7:51
Party politics it was very important to understand for him what kind of system
7:58
of check and balance was built in this country the role of the Supreme Court
8:03
but also how do you win elections that's what he was looking for first and for
8:08
Miles so it was important for his political education exactly he was looking and he had to learn how to do it
8:17
how to [Music]
8:23
win Jena says he became a voracious consumer of all things politics but also
8:28
you know this famous TV series wire the wire even TV shows remember you know
8:34
Season 3 and four there are election campaign for the mayor of Baltimore
8:40
everything that had to do with politics he was watching or reading and he was picking up different tools and he
8:48
started trying out some of the things he was learning he told me that he put
8:53
chairs for the elderly people who came to his railes precisely so that that you
8:59
know they could see it comfortably and he said you know what J I saw it in the
9:04
house of cards I saw it in the house of cards and I thought that's a great idea
9:11
so he saw in the House of Cards the television show with Kevin spacy he saw that political leaders would put chairs
9:17
for elderly people because you know that was something you were supposed to do as a politician navali did
9:23
that yes but meanwhile he wasn't just studying up on American politics he was
9:29
also teaching himself how to use YouTube building a following online and he was studying public
9:36
[Music] speaking and he came up on the stage and
9:41
that was brilliant speech and his political activity and his speeches
9:48
started getting more [Applause]
9:55
polished asking this 100,000 strong crowd standing in front of him who is the real
10:04
power in this country we are we going to give up our inspiration to take our
10:10
country back no there was huge energy which was
10:19
coming out of him he was very sincere and you felt like he was talking
10:26
directly to you okay so navani is is getting a political education he's
10:31
becoming a more polished speaker and he starts to run for office so he runs for
10:37
mayor of Moscow in 2013 he gets a pretty significant share of the vote in by
10:43
Russian standards right above 27% 27% okay and then in
10:49
2018 he makes a big move he takes on Putin himself tell me about that NAA
10:57
decided to run for the presidency by then everyone in Russia already
11:03
recognized that the only guy who was capable to challenge Putin what let say
11:08
naal and naal started traveling around the
11:14
country Russia is a huge country it's the biggest country in the world 11 time
11:20
zones so he was going from gal mountains
11:25
to the Russian far from the fares to magad from Madan to the White Sea and
11:32
Etc and he was running a campaign pretty much the way that campaign is run in the
11:39
United
11:48
States and N spoke from the roof of the garages from the stairs of different
11:54
buildings spoke from the roofs of the apartment buildings you know he would speak from the L we should we must live
12:02
better but we don't because they've stolen everything from us and they steal from us every day critics say the
12:08
opposition he say let's go to the creman and get our power back power should be
12:15
in our hands not in the hands of those Crews of those cheaters of those people
12:21
who stole the wealth of the country he called the people in the Kremlin Crooks and cheaters and said they had stolen
12:27
your money in fact Russia's money that they were thieves basically exactly and
12:34
people were cling by thousands to listen to
12:44
him and a friend of mine wrote to me that he was impressed to see how people
12:49
who were pretty much resentful about naali who considered him to be a
12:55
populist and was afraid of his popularism at the end of the meeting they gave him
13:02
standing AAS they were so impressed and so it was important to
13:10
bring politics from Moscow down to the provinces to the regions of the Russian
13:15
Federation and bring people there to recognize that they need him as a
13:21
president because he was going to make life of their City their Town their
13:27
region better more democratic more [Music]
13:36
prosperous and Jena what were you thinking as you were watching all of this unfold I mean he's doing this very
13:43
unusual thing for Russia right this thing that to an American audience is just sort of meat and potatoes political
13:49
campaigning but in Russia was kind of a revelation yes I was thinking that I was
13:56
afraid that they were going to kill him it was already after Baris n was killed
14:04
back in 2015 this is a another important opposition leader who was killed not far
14:11
from the Kremlin actually in a political assassination yes did navani himself worry about being
14:18
killed did he talk about this with you no I wouldn't say that he
14:25
talked but you know whenever I was about the question of his you know
14:32
security or getting people who would at least protect him he kept saying that
14:38
basically it's impossible I think you know he just didn't allow himself to think about that
14:46
Jen did you have any personal conversations with him about why he wanted to run against Putin in the
14:52
presidential election why he wanted to do that because we knew that Putin was
14:58
very very dangerous that it was important to stop him because already
15:04
the majority of democratic institutions in the country was subverted courts didn't exist Judiciary didn't exist
15:12
Puttin subordinates from the eff being all this checks they were grabbing people's property kicking out people you
15:19
know putting them in jail making them to go in Exile so it's already you know it was clear that Putin Was preparing for
15:28
some awful development and they had to be stopped and it was clear that the only
15:36
one who was capable to stop Putin was iali nobody else had balls to do that as
15:44
simple as that it was not that we discussed whether he should or should
15:50
not it was clear that he had [Music]
15:57
to [Music] we'll be right
16:02
[Music]
16:07
back election officials in Russia have banned opposition leader Alexi naali
16:13
from running for president the country's Election Commission has barred the Kremlin critic from standing in the
16:18
March vote citing a controversial embezzlement conviction n says was politically
16:27
motivated
16:34
Russian opposition leader Alex Nal has called for a boycott of next year's election after the country's Central
16:40
Election Commission rejected his bid to take part well Lexi Nal believes that if
16:45
he ran against Vladimir Putin in what he deemed would be a free and fair election that he could beat Vladimir Putin and he
16:51
actually thinks that Putin is afraid of him afraid of Alexi
16:57
navali [Music] when the effort to get him on the ballot
17:05
failed what was naval's reaction he was extremely upset he was
17:11
very very angry but he doesn't relent in his political activities right he
17:17
continues to speak out against Putin and eventually Putin tries to take navali
17:23
out he poisons him and navali ends up convalescing in Germany where he
17:28
recovers this is a very dramatic part of his life and he makes at that point an
17:35
interesting decision which is that he's going to leave his family in Germany and
17:41
return to Russia where it seemed like he was pretty much certainly going to be
17:47
arrested and put in prison and yet he goes back so why why to be honest with you I
17:56
think that he didn't have any any other option to the turn back you cannot ask
18:03
people to be brave and to resist and to reject the regime sitting
18:12
in the luxury of the European capitals you have to be with your people and
18:17
that's exactly what he said I'm Russian politician so I have to be in Russia he
18:24
said and he had to demonstrate to people that it was possible to overcome any
18:31
fear when he was on trial he had a piece of paper and her wrote on it I am not
18:39
afraid and you shouldn't be afraid as well when he gave his interview to uh
18:47
the director of this movie uh documentary naal and he was asked what's going to
18:54
happen what people should know if you get killed and and his answer was if I get
19:01
killed my only message to you and he said is in Russian don't give
19:08
up don't give up that was his slogan
19:13
that was the main principle of his life don't give up don't be afraid it's
19:19
important Sabrina to understand that Soviet KB and now this Putin's FSB this
19:26
political police which are running the country its power is based on people's
19:33
fear they're capable to control the country because people are afraid and so
19:40
naal was trying to send this message don't be afraid we have to fight these
19:47
people this is our country and that's what we have to do so really more than
19:54
any other political issue his fundamental message was our fear is
20:02
their power don't allow them that don't give it to them that's what he was
20:08
saying to people exactly 100% And I realized it sounds like Jena
20:15
he didn't think he had any other option you don't think potentially he had any other option he had to go back because
20:21
that's who he was but I wonder if you think now was
20:27
that the right decision to return to Russia yes it was the right decision to
20:35
return back to Russ yes he gambled yes he thought that
20:41
Putin he wouldn't dare to kill him because he was well too famous and he
20:46
returned back after he exposed P's henchman and he wrote to me in one of
20:53
his letters I know that I'm going to sit in jail as long as Putin is alive he
21:00
knew that you know it's very difficult to get into someone's else uh head but
21:07
you know I just think that he felt humilated to be afraid of Putin or
21:14
anybody else he had the sense of mission of he
21:19
was running a good fight and he had all the intention to
21:26
win this fight and if you think that you're going to get killed or you start
21:32
to pity yourself you know like her wrote to me stop being upset everything is
21:39
okay it's just a historical process Russia is going through this
21:44
historical process and we are going along with it everything is going to be
21:50
okay and even if everything is not going to be okay we can consult ourselves we will
21:59
get consolation in the fact of having lived honest lives of being honest
22:06
people Jen it strikes me that naval's true superpower was that he was not
22:13
afraid he had this kind of incomprehensible lack of fear this confidence that he could win despite
22:20
what it looked like from the outside and that that gave him this ability to kind
22:26
of thumb his nose at the sister system right to sort of make fun of it and show people that in the end it's just a bunch
22:32
of idiots trying and failing to poison his underwear right like the system was
22:38
nothing but that it wasn't that scary but now that he's dead it's like
22:45
that magic trick it disappears and the death itself seems to teach a different lesson that people
22:53
should be afraid that the system is that scary what do you think think of
22:59
that I'm not afraid and you know if you look at those in Russia thousands and thousands of
23:07
people come and you know They Mourn and grief nowly almost 400 people were arrested
23:16
people were beaten by the police but people keep coming and coming and coming
23:23
and when you look at their faces you see that that these are predominant the young
23:29
people he presented the future to them are they going to give up on their
23:35
future are they going to go into Exile all of them it's not
23:40
possible but they may stay quiet and do nothing which is what he advised against
23:46
right I mean you know you say Jena you're not afraid but you're in the US in Exile right it's frightening this
23:53
regime and it's a natural response to be afraid of it so I guess I'm just
23:58
wondering what is his legacy like what's left you know he's gone is there anything that survives
24:06
him I think his legacy is his belief that Russia is not
24:16
doomed that Russia will become a normal
24:21
civilized Democratic free peaceful and prosperous
24:27
country and I think that his belief and his
24:32
courage and the fact that he sacrificed his one and the only life for the future
24:38
of Russia that's what will become an inspiration for millions of young
24:45
Russians I cannot stand the thought that his death was in vain and I think that
24:54
his wife jul na she is going to defend and to carry on the kind of fight that
25:03
naal tragically failed to accomplish because he was
25:09
killed J what are you going to miss most about your friend about
25:15
alexe his smile I'm going to miss his smile I'm going to miss our
25:21
conversations I'm going to miss the friend who was ready to give his hand
25:28
even from jail I'm going to miss a
25:34
politician who was capable to turn my
25:39
country into a normal Democratic free and peaceful
25:45
country I still you know I sometimes you know I just walk around my
25:51
apartment and I say out loud
25:56
aosa where are you it's still hard to
26:02
comprehend that he's no longer with us and I'm going to miss my
26:09
friend that's why he was my friend of 20 years you know the last time I saw him
26:15
it wasn't the in his penal colony it was in the summer of
26:22
2022 and he came and he hugged me and I told him don't worry
26:28
about your parents I'm taking care about them and then I saw how you know he
26:35
walked out of this Hall he was getting into the door that led to this prison
26:42
Barrack and you know a minute ago he was smiling and um he was you know saying
26:51
something funny and encouraging Etc and I saw how his face became duck
26:58
and I was thinking God you know what are they doing to this brilliant human
27:04
being how long will he be able to withstand all that torture and
27:12
humiliation and now of course I think how he died and it makes me sick to think that
27:21
he died alone surrounded by all this dotting little people and I'm so sorry
27:31
for him he was just 47 year old and I think that it is so
27:39
unfair that an evil guy an evil
27:45
person he lives in Comfort even though he brings no good to
27:53
anyone around him and me is laying somewhere in the
28:01
morg in the Arctic Circle and there is no
28:09
sun Shena thank you for talking to me thank you Saina good night
28:16
Jane good [Music]
28:24
night the Russian authorities have yet to give naval's body back to his
28:30
family on Tuesday his mother Ludmila naal stood in front of the Arctic prison
28:36
where he was being held to demand her son's
28:49
release she said quote I ask you Vladimir Putin let me finally see my son
28:57
the decision is entirely in your [Music]
29:06
hands we'll be right
29:13
back here's what else you should know today Alabama's Supreme Court has ruled
29:18
that Frozen embryos in test tubes should be considered children a decision that
29:24
sent shock waves through the world of Reproductive Medicine the ruling issued late last week stemmed
29:31
from appeals cases brought by couples in Alabama whose embryos were destroyed in
29:37
2020 on Wednesday the ruling was already having a profound effect the University
29:43
of Alabama at Birmingham Health System announced that it was pausing inv vitro
29:48
fertilization treatments while it evaluated the Court's ruling and the times reports that
29:56
President Biden is considering executive action that could prevent people who cross illegally into the United States
30:03
from claiming Asylum the extraordinary action would put into effect a key policy in a
30:10
bipartisan bill that Republicans thwarted earlier this month it is similar to a 2018 effort by then
30:18
president Donald Trump to stop migration which was eventually blocked by federal
30:24
courts but even if Biden's effort gets stopped in Court a legal fight could
30:29
allow him to try to neutralize one of his biggest political vulnerabilities
