The Supreme Court Takes Up Homelessness



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Katherine
0:03
benold this is the
0:06
daily this morning we're taking a much
0:08
closer look at homelessness in the
0:10
United States as it reaches a level not
0:12
seen in the modern era California as the
0:14
number of homeless people has searched
0:16
in the US more than 653,000 a 12%
0:21
population increase since last year the
0:24
debate over homeless encampments across
0:26
the country has intensified it is not
0:28
Humane to let people live on our streets
0:31
and Tents use drugs we are not standing
0:35
for it anymore people have had it
0:38
they're fed up I'm fed up people want to
0:40
see these tents and encampments removed
0:42
in a compassionate and thoughtful way
0:44
and we agree with public officials
0:46
saying they need more tools to address
0:49
the crisis we move from block to block
0:51
in every block they say can't be here
0:52
can't be here can't be here I don't know
0:54
where it's supposed to go you know and
0:56
homeless people and their Advocates
0:58
saying those tools are intended to
1:00
unfairly punish them they come and they
1:02
sweep and they take everything from me
1:03
and I can't get out of the hole I'm in
1:06
because they keep putting me back in
1:08
square one that debate is now reaching
1:11
the Supreme Court which is about to hear
1:13
arguments in the most significant case
1:16
on homelessness in decades about whether
1:19
cities can make it illegal to be
1:22
homeless my colleague Abby fle on the
1:25
backstory of that case and its
1:27
far-reaching implications for cities
1:29
across the
1:34
[Music]
1:40
US it's Friday April
1:49
19th so Abby you've been reporting on
1:52
this case that has been Making Waves
1:54
gr's pass versus Johnson which the
1:57
Supreme Court is taking up next week
1:59
what's this case about so this case is
2:02
about a small town in Oregon where three
2:05
homeless people sued the city after they
2:08
received tickets for sleeping and
2:09
camping outside and this case is the
2:13
latest case that shows this growing
2:15
tension especially in states in the west
2:18
between people who are homeless and
2:20
cities who are trying to figure out what
2:23
to do about this these cities have seen
2:25
a sharp increase in homeless encampments
2:28
in public spaces especially
2:30
with people on sidewalks and in parks
2:33
and they've raised questions about
2:35
public drug use and other safety issues
2:37
in these spaces and so the question
2:40
before the justices is really how far a
2:43
city can go to police homelessness can
2:47
City officials and police use local laws
2:50
to ban people from laying down outside
2:53
and sleeping in a public space can a
2:57
city essentially make it illegal to be
3:00
homeless so three homeless people sued
3:03
the city of gr pass saying it's not
3:05
illegal to be homeless and therefore
3:08
it's not illegal to sleep in a public
3:10
space yes that's right and they weren't
3:13
the first people to make this argument
3:15
the issue actually started years ago
3:17
with a case about 500 miles to the east
3:20
in Boise
3:22
Idaho and in that case which is called
3:25
Martin V
3:26
Boise this man Robert Martin who is
3:29
homeless and Boise he was charged with a
3:33
misdemeanor for sleeping in some bushes
3:36
and the City of Boise had laws on the
3:38
books to prohibit public camping and
3:43
Robert Martin and a group of other
3:45
people who are homeless in the city they
3:48
sued the city and they claimed that the
3:51
city's laws violated the eth amendment's
3:56
prohibition on cruel and unusual
3:59
punishment and what makes it cruel and
4:02
unusual so their argument was that the
4:05
city did not have enough sufficient
4:07
shelter beds for everyone who was
4:09
homeless in the city and so they were
4:12
forced to sleep outside they said you
4:15
know we have no place to go and that an
4:18
essential human need is to sleep and we
4:22
want to be able to lay down on the
4:24
sidewalk or in an alley or someplace to
4:27
rest and that their local laws were a
4:31
violation of Robert Martin and the
4:33
others constitutional rights that the
4:36
city is violating the eth amendment by
4:40
criminalizing the human need to
4:47
sleep and the courts who heard the case
4:50
agreed with that argument the courts
4:52
ruled that the city had violated the
4:54
Constitution and that the city could not
4:57
punish people for being involuntary
5:00
homeless and what that meant the court
5:04
laid out is that someone is
5:06
involuntarily homeless if a city does
5:09
not have enough adequate shelter beds
5:12
for the number of people who are
5:13
homeless in the city it does seem like a
5:16
very important distinction they're
5:17
saying basically if you have nowhere
5:19
else to go you can't be punished for
5:22
sleeping on the street right that's what
5:24
the court was saying in the Martin B
5:26
Boise case and the of Boise then
5:31
appealed the case they asked the Supreme
5:34
Court to step in and take it on but the
5:37
Supreme Court declined to hear the case
5:40
so since then the Martin V Boise case
5:44
controls all over western parts of the
5:47
US in What's called the ninth circuit
5:50
which includes Oregon where the Grants
5:53
Pass case
5:55
originated okay so tell us about Grants
5:57
Pass this city at the center of of the
5:59
case and now in front of the Supreme
6:01
Court what's the story there Grants Pass
6:06
is a town in rural Southwestern Oregon
6:10
it's a town of about 38,000 people it's
6:13
a former Timber town that now really
6:16
relies a lot on tourists to go rafting
6:19
through the river and go wine tasting in
6:23
the countryside and it's a pretty
6:26
conservative town when I did interviews
6:29
you know people talked about it having a
6:31
very strong libertarian streak and when
6:34
I talked with people in the town people
6:37
said you know when they were growing up
6:38
there it was very rare to see someone
6:41
who was homeless it just was not an
6:42
issue that was talked a lot about in the
6:45
community but it did become a big issue
6:48
about 10 years
6:50
ago people in the community started to
6:54
get worried about what they saw as an
6:57
increase in the number number of
7:00
homeless people that they were noticing
7:02
around town and it's unclear whether the
7:06
problem was growing or whether local
7:09
officials and residents were worried
7:12
that it might whether they were fearing
7:14
that it might but in any case in 2013
7:17
the city council decided to start
7:20
stepping up enforcement of local
7:23
ordinances that did things like Outlaw
7:26
camping in public parks or sleeping
7:28
outside this series of overlapping local
7:31
laws that would make it you know
7:33
impossible for people to sleep in public
7:36
spaces in Grants Pass and at one meeting
7:41
one of the former city council members
7:43
she said the point is to make it
7:45
uncomfortable enough for them in our
7:47
city so they will want to move on down
7:50
the
7:54
road so it sounds like at least in
7:56
Grant's past that this is not really
7:58
about reducing homelessness it's about
8:01
reducing the number of visible homeless
8:03
people in the town well I would say that
8:06
you know City officials and many local
8:08
residents would say that the homeless
8:10
encampments are actually creating real
8:13
concerns about Public Safety that it's
8:16
actually creating all kinds of issues
8:18
for everyone else who lives in Grants
8:20
Pass and you know there are drug issues
8:23
and mental health issues and that this
8:25
is actually bringing a lot of chaos to
8:27
the
8:28
city okay so in order to deal with these
8:31
concerns you said that they decided to
8:33
start enforcing these local measures
8:35
what does that actually look like on the
8:37
ground so police started handing out
8:40
tickets in Grants Pass these were you
8:43
know civil tickets where people would
8:46
get fines and if police noticed people
8:50
you know doing this enough times then
8:53
they could issue them a trespass from a
8:56
park and then that would give you know
8:59
for certain number of days somebody
9:00
would be banned from the park and if
9:03
police caught them in the park before
9:05
that time period was up then the person
9:07
could face criminal time um they could
9:09
go to jail and homeless people started
9:12
rocking up fines you know hundreds of
9:15
dollars of fines I talked to a lot of
9:18
people who were camping in the Parks who
9:21
had racked up these fines over the years
9:23
and each one would have multiple tickets
9:27
they had no way to pay I talked to
9:29
people who tried to challenge the
9:31
tickets and they had to leave their
9:33
belongings back in the park and you know
9:36
they would come back to find someone had
9:38
taken their stuff or their things had
9:40
been impounded so it just you know it
9:42
seemed to be this cycle that actually
9:44
was entrenching people more into
9:48
homelessness and yet at the same time
9:51
none of these people had left Grant's
9:52
Pass so they did make it very
9:54
uncomfortable for homeless people but it
9:57
doesn't seem to be working people are
9:59
not leaving right people are not leaving
10:02
and these tickets and fines it's
10:05
something that people had been dealing
10:07
with for years in Grant's Pass but in
10:12
2018 the Martin V Boise case happened
10:16
and not long after that a group of
10:19
people and Grants Pass challenged these
10:22
ordinances and they used the Boise case
10:27
to make their argument that just like in
10:30
Boise Grant's Pass was punishing people
10:35
for being involuntarily homeless that
10:39
this overlapping group of local
10:41
ordinances and Grants Pass had made it
10:44
so there is nowhere to put a pillow and
10:46
blanket on the ground and sleep without
10:49
being in some kind of violation of a
10:51
rule and this group of local homeless
10:53
people make the argument that everyone
10:56
in Grant's Pass who is homeless is
11:00
involuntarily homeless and you told us
11:03
earlier that it it was basically the
11:05
lack of available shelter that makes a
11:08
homeless person involuntarily homeless
11:10
so is there a homeless shelter in
11:12
Grant's Pass well it sort of depends on
11:16
the standard that you're using so there
11:19
is no public low barrier shelter that is
11:23
easy for somebody to just walk in and
11:25
stay for a night if they need some place
11:27
to go Grants Pass does not not have a
11:29
shelter like that H there is one shelter
11:33
in Grant's Pass but it's a religious
11:35
shelter and there are lots of
11:37
restrictions I spoke with the head of
11:40
the shelter who explained you know the
11:42
purpose is really to get people back
11:45
into the workforce and so they have a
11:47
30-day program that's really designed
11:49
for that purpose and you know as part of
11:52
that people can't have pets people are
11:55
not allowed to smoke they're required to
11:57
attend Christian relig ious services and
12:01
some of the people who I interviewed who
12:03
had chronic mental health and physical
12:05
disabilities said that they had been
12:08
turned away or weren't able to stay
12:10
there because of the level of needs that
12:12
they have and so if you come in with any
12:15
kind of issue like that it can be a
12:17
problem that's a very long list of
12:19
restrictions and of course people are
12:22
homeless for a lot of very different
12:24
reasons it sounds like a lot of these
12:25
reasons might actually disqualify them
12:27
from this particular shelter so when
12:31
they say they have nowhere else to go if
12:33
they're in Grants Pass they kind of have
12:35
a point so that's what the court decided
12:39
in
12:40
2022 when the courts heard this case
12:43
they agreed with the homeless plaintiffs
12:45
that there's no low barrier shelter in
12:48
Grant's Pass and that the religious
12:50
shelter did not meet the Court's
12:53
requirements but the city who are
12:56
actually now represented by the same
12:58
lawyers who argued for Boise keeps
13:01
appealing the case and they appeal up to
13:04
the ninth circuit just as in the Boise
13:07
case and the judges there find in favor
13:11
of the homeless plaintiffs uh and they
13:14
they find that grants passes ordinances
13:17
are so restrictive that there is no
13:20
place where someone can lay down and
13:23
sleep in Grants Pass and that therefore
13:27
the city has violated the Eighth
13:28
Amendment
13:29
and they cannot enforce these ordinances
13:32
in the way that they have been for years
13:35
so at that point the court upholds the
13:38
Boise precedent and we're kind of where
13:40
we were when it all started but as we
13:43
know that's not the end of the story
13:46
because this case stays in the court
13:48
system what
13:51
happened so by this point the
13:54
homelessness problem is really exploding
13:57
throughout the western part of the us
14:00
with more visible encampments and it
14:02
really becomes a politically divisive
14:05
issue and leaders sort of across the
14:08
political Spectrum point to Boise as a
14:12
root cause of the
14:14
problem so when Grant's Pass comes along
14:18
people saw that case as a way
14:21
potentially to undo
14:23
boisey if only they could get it before
14:26
The Supreme Court
14:29
[Music]
14:36
we'll be right
14:39
[Music]
14:49
back Abby you just told us that as
14:52
homeless numbers went up and these
14:54
homeless encampments really started
14:56
spreading it's no longer just
14:58
conservatives who want the Supreme Court
14:59
to revisit the Boise ruling it's
15:01
liberals too that's right so there's a
15:04
really broad group of people who all
15:07
started pushing for the Supreme Court to
15:11
take up the Grants Pass case and you
15:14
know they did this by filing briefs to
15:16
the Supreme Court laying out their
15:18
reasoning and you know it's everyone
15:21
from the liberal governor of California
15:24
and you know many Progressive liberal
15:27
cities to some of the most conservative
15:30
legal groups and you know they disagree
15:33
about their reasoning but they all are
15:37
asking the court to
15:38
clarify how to interpret the Boise
15:41
decision they are saying essentially
15:43
that the Boise decision has been
15:46
understood in different ways you know in
15:48
all different parts of the West and that
15:52
that is causing confusion and creating
15:54
all sorts of problems and they're
15:56
blaming that on the Boise case it's
15:59
interesting because after everything you
16:00
told us about these very Extreme
16:02
Measures really that the city of Grant's
16:04
Pass took against homeless people it it
16:06
is kind of surprising that these liberal
16:08
bastions that you're you're mentioning
16:10
are are siding with the town in this
16:12
case you know just to be clear they are
16:15
not saying that they support necessarily
16:18
you know the way that Grants Pass OR
16:19
Boise had enforced their laws but they
16:22
are saying that the court rulings have
16:26
tied their hands with this ambiguous
16:29
decision on how to act and what exactly
16:32
is so ambiguous about the Boise decision
16:35
which if I remember correctly simply
16:37
said that if someone is involuntarily
16:40
homeless if they're on the streets
16:41
because there's no adequate shelter
16:43
space available they can't be punished
16:46
for that yeah so there are a couple of
16:49
things that are sort of common threads
16:50
in the cities and the groups that are
16:53
asking for clarity from the court and
16:55
the first thing is that they're saying
16:58
you know what is adequate shelter that
17:01
every homeless person situation is
17:03
different so what are cities or places
17:06
required to provide for people who are
17:10
homeless what is the standard that they
17:12
need to meet in order not to sleep on
17:14
the street that's right so you know if
17:17
the standard is that a city has to have
17:19
enough beds for everyone who is homeless
17:21
but certain kinds of shelters or beds
17:24
wouldn't qualify then kind of what are
17:27
the rules around that mhm and the second
17:30
thing is that they're asking for clarity
17:32
around what involuntarily homeless means
17:36
and so in the Boise decision that meant
17:40
that someone is involuntarily homeless
17:42
if there is not enough bed space for
17:45
them to go to but a lot of cities are
17:47
saying what about people who don't want
17:49
to go into a shelter even if there's a
17:52
shelter bed available if they have a pet
17:55
or if they are a smoker or if something
17:58
might prohibit them from going to a
18:00
shelter how is a city supposed to weigh
18:03
that and at what point would they cross
18:04
a line for the court it's almost a
18:07
philosophical question like you know if
18:09
somebody doesn't want to be in a shelter
18:11
are they still allowed to sleep in a
18:13
public space yeah I mean these are
18:15
complicated questions that sort of go
18:18
beyond the eth amendment argument but
18:20
that a lot of the organizations that
18:23
have reached out to the court through
18:24
these Friend of the Court briefs are
18:27
asking okay I can see that sort of the
18:29
unifying element here is that in all
18:32
these briefs various people from across
18:34
the Spectrum are saying you know hello
18:37
Supreme Court we basically need some
18:38
clarity here give us some clarity the
18:41
question that I have is why did the
18:43
Supreme Court agree to weigh in on
18:45
Grant's PA after declining to take up
18:49
Boise well it's not possible for us to
18:52
say for certain because the Supreme
18:55
Court does not give reasons why it is
18:58
agreed to hear or to not hear a case
19:02
they get thousands of cases a year and
19:05
they just you know they they take up
19:06
just a few of those and their
19:08
deliberations are secret but you know we
19:10
can point to a few things one is that
19:13
the makeup of the court has change the
19:15
court has gained conservative justices
19:17
in the last few years this court has not
19:20
been shy about taking up hot button
19:23
issues across the spectrum of American
19:26
society in this case the court hasn't
19:29
heard a major homelessness case like
19:31
this but I would really point to the
19:33
sheer number and the range of the people
19:37
who are petitioning the court to take a
19:39
look at this case these are major
19:41
players in the country who are asking
19:43
the court for guidance and the Supreme
19:46
Court does weigh in on issues of
19:48
national importance and the people who
19:50
are asking for help clearly believe that
19:53
this is one of those
19:55
issues so let's start digging into the
19:57
actual arguments and maybe let's start
19:59
with the city of Grants Pass what are
20:01
the central arguments that they're
20:03
expected to make before The Supreme
20:05
Court you know so the city's arguments
20:08
turn on this narrow legal issue of
20:10
whether the eth amendment applies or
20:12
doesn't and and they say that it doesn't
20:14
but I actually think that in some ways
20:17
that's not the most helpful way to sort
20:19
of understanding what Grants Pass is
20:20
arguing what is really at the heart of
20:23
their argument is that if the court
20:25
upholds Grants Pass and Boise that they
20:29
are tying the hands of Grants Pass and
20:33
hundreds of other towns and cities to
20:35
actually act to solve and respond to
20:39
homelessness and by that I mean to solve
20:42
issues of people camping in the Parks
20:45
but also more broadly of public safety
20:47
issues of being able to address problems
20:50
as they arise in sort of a fluid and
20:52
flexible way in the varied ways that
20:56
they're going to show up in all these
20:58
different places is and their argument
21:01
is if the court accepts the Grants Pass
21:04
in Boise
21:06
Holdings that they will be
21:09
constitutionalizing or sort of freezing
21:12
in place and limiting all of these
21:15
governments from acting right this is
21:18
essentially the argument being repeated
21:20
again and again in those briefs that you
21:22
mentioned earlier that unless the
21:24
Supreme Court overturns these decisions
21:28
it's almost a impossible for these
21:29
cities to get the encampments under
21:31
control yes that's right and they also
21:34
argue they need to have flexibility in
21:35
dealing actually with people who are
21:37
homeless and being able to figure out
21:40
using a local ordinance to try to
21:42
convince someone to go to treatment that
21:45
they say you know they need carrots and
21:47
sticks they need to be able to use every
21:50
tool that they can to be able to try to
21:52
solve this problem and how do we make
21:54
sense of that argument when Grants Pass
21:57
is clearly not using that many tools to
22:00
deal with homeless people for example
22:02
you know it didn't have shelters as you
22:05
mentioned so the city's argument is that
22:07
this just should not be an eighth
22:09
amendment issue that this is the wrong
22:11
you know way to think about this case
22:14
that issues around homelessness and how
22:16
a city handles it is a policy question
22:19
so things like shelter beds or the way
22:22
that the city is handling their
22:24
ordinances should really be left up to
22:27
policy makers and City officials not to
22:30
this really broad constitutional
22:32
argument and so you know therefore the
22:36
city is likely to focus their argument
22:39
entirely on this very narrow
22:41
question and how does the other side
22:44
counter this argument the homeless
22:46
plaintiffs are going to argue that
22:47
there's nothing in the lower courts
22:49
decisions that say that cities can't
22:51
enforce their laws that they can't you
22:53
know stop people from littering that
22:55
they can't stop drug use that they can't
22:57
clear encampments if there becomes
22:59
public safety problems they're just
23:01
saying that a city cannot not provide
23:05
shelter and then make it illegal for
23:07
people to lay down and sleep so both
23:10
sides are saying that a city should be
23:13
able to take action when there's public
23:15
disorder as a result of these homeless
23:18
encampments but they're pointing at each
23:20
other and saying the way you want to
23:21
handle homelessness is wrong I think
23:25
everyone in this case agrees that
23:27
homelessness and the increase in
23:29
homelessness is bad for everyone it's
23:32
bad for people who are camping in the
23:34
park it is bad for the community that
23:37
nobody is saying that the current
23:39
situation is tenable everyone is saying
23:41
there need to be Solutions we need to be
23:43
able to figure out what to do about
23:45
homelessness and how to care for people
23:47
who are homeless how do we wrestle with
23:50
all these problems it's just that the
23:52
way that they think about it couldn't be
23:54
farther apart and what can you tell me
23:57
about how the Supreme Court is actually
23:58
expected to rule in
24:00
this there are a number of ways that the
24:03
justices could decide on this case they
24:06
could take a really narrow approach and
24:08
just focus on Grants Pass and the
24:10
arguments about those local ordinances I
24:13
think that somewhat unlikely because
24:15
they've decided to take up this case of
24:17
national importance a ruling in favor of
24:21
the homeless plaintiffs would mean that
24:23
they've accepted this eth amendment
24:25
argument that you cannot criminalize
24:27
being homeless and a ruling for the city
24:29
you know every legal expert I've talked
24:31
to has said that would mean an end to
24:33
Boise and that it would sort of break
24:35
apart the current state that we've been
24:37
living in for these last several years
24:40
I'm struck by how much this case and our
24:43
conversation has been about policing
24:46
homelessness rather than actually
24:48
addressing the root causes of
24:49
homelessness we're not really talking
24:51
about say the right to shelter or the
24:54
right to treatment for people who you
24:55
know who are mentally ill and sleeping
24:57
on the streets as a result
24:58
uh which is quite a big proportion and
25:00
at the end of the day whatever way the
25:03
ruling goes it will be about the
25:05
visibility of homelessness and not the
25:07
root
25:10
causes yeah I think that's right that's
25:12
really kind of what's looming in the
25:13
background of this case is what impact
25:15
is it going to have will it make things
25:17
better or worse and for who and these
25:23
court cases have really become this
25:24
talking point for cities and for their
25:27
leaders blaming the spike in encampments
25:31
and the visibility of homelessness on
25:34
these Court
25:35
decisions but homelessness you know
25:37
everyone acknowledges is such a
25:38
complicated
25:40
issue people have told me in interviews
25:43
for the story they've blamed increases
25:46
in homelessness on everything from the
25:48
pandemic to forest fires to skyrocketing
25:51
housing costs in the west coast and that
25:55
the role that Boise and now Grants Pass
25:58
play in this has always been a little
26:00
hard to pin down and if the Supreme
26:03
Court overturns those cases then we'll
26:06
really see whether they were the
26:07
obstacle that political leaders said
26:09
that they were and if these cases fall
26:12
you know it sort of it remains to be
26:14
seen whether cities do try to find all
26:17
these Creative Solutions with housing
26:20
and services to try to help people who
26:22
are homeless or whether they sort of
26:25
once again fall back on just sending
26:28
people to
26:33
jail Abby thank you very much thank you

here's what else you need to know today
27:10
early on Friday Israel attacked a
27:13
military base in central Iran the
27:16
explosion came less than a week after
27:17
Iran's attack on Israel last weekend and
27:20
was part of a cycle of retaliation that
27:22
has brought the shadow war between the
27:23
two countries out in the open the scale
27:27
and method of Friday's attack remained
27:29
unclear and the initial reaction in both
27:32
Israel and Iran was to downplay its
27:34
significance world leaders have urged
27:37
both sides to exercise restraint in
27:39
order to avoid sparking a broader war in
27:41
the
27:42
region and 12 New Yorkers have been
27:46
selected to decide Donald Trump's
27:48

28:37
demonstration and dismantle aend
28:45
