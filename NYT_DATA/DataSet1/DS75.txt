Hamas Took Her, and Still Has Her Husband


0:02
um I can't remember the word but you know the kind of funy funy connection
0:08
between trees in a forest how do you call itum
0:14
melum melium you know we just I just somehow feel that we are connected by
0:21
this kind of infinite wave of mycelium we are so bound together and
0:30
and I don't think we really realized that until all this
0:37
happened it's it's quite hard to explain to me in a sense because you know some
0:44
people would say oh I'm so hoping your father will come and then everything will be
0:49
okay and it's very hard to explain that
0:55
really this group of people decided to you know bring us up together share all
1:02
their resources over 75 years grow into each other fight endlessly with each
1:10
other love and hate each other but somehow stay together and their children
1:16
will then meet and marry and make grandchildren and there's so many levels
1:21
of connection and I'm sitting here in the room and I see their faces some of them
1:29
you know and we are incredibly um it's hard to explain how
1:36
much these people are missing from our kind of forest
1:45
[Music] ground from The New York Times I'm
1:53
Sabrina Tavern see and this is the daily it's been new near 6 months since
2:01
Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th and took more than 200 people into
2:06
Gaza one of the hardest hit places was a village called near o near the border
2:12
with Gaza one quarter of its residents were either killed or taken
2:18
hostage yev leitz was one of those hostages and so was her husband OD Dead
2:25
Leaf shits yavid was eventually released odad

okay I'll translate um my name is y lifshitz I'm 85 years old I was born in
3:57
1938 when I was 18 I arrived at kibuts near o I came along with a group of
4:03
people who decided to come and form and build a
4:09
community on a very Sandy territory which was close to the Gaza
4:16
Strip and my name is shiron leitz I am 52 year
4:22
old I was raised in kibuts n o by my mom and dad so I lived there until I was 20
4:29
and I live for the last 30 something years in London and Shon what do you
4:35
have next to you next to me I have a poster of my dad in both English and
4:42
Hebrew and it says dead LIF sheets 83 and below that it says bring him home
4:50
now and it's a photo where I always feel the love because he's looking at me and
4:58
there's a lot of love in it in his eyes and why did you want to bring him
5:03
here today Shon because he should be talking
5:09
himself he should be here and able to tell his story and instead I'm doing it on his
5:17
behalf you know it should have been a story of my mom and dad sitting here and
5:24
telling their [Music] story the story of aded and yev began
5:31
before they ever met in Poland in the 1930s anti-Semitism was surging in
5:37
Europe and their families decided to flee to Palestine youits in 1933 the year Hitler
5:44
came to power and aads a year later yav remembers a Time near the end
5:50
of the war when her father received news from back home in Poland he was deeply
5:56
religious a kentor in a synagogue and he gathered GED his family around him to share what he
6:08
learned and he said we don't have a family anymore they've all been murdered
6:15
and he explained to us why there is no God if there was a God he would have
6:20
protected my family and this means that there is no
6:28
God and suddenly we stopped going to
6:34
synagogue we used to go every
6:40
Saturday so it was a deep crisis for him the shock and the trauma were very deep
6:46
Argentina abion Soviet Union Yes United
6:55
Kingdom y's father lived long enough to see a state established for his children
7:01
the UN resolution of 1947 paved the way for a new country for Jews and the next
7:07
spring Israel declared its independence you remembers listening to the news on the radio with her parents
7:13
is the general assembly of the United Nations has made its decision on Palestine the
7:20
map we had a country so now we'll have somebody who's
7:25
protecting us it's a country for the people to rebuild the people this was
7:32
the feeling we had in other words if God could not protect you this nation maybe
7:41
[Music]
7:49
could yes but the next day it was already
7:55
sad Israel was immediately forced to defend itself when its Arab neighbors attacked Israel won that war but its
8:03
Victory came at a great cost to the Palestinian Arabs living there more than
8:09
700,000 either fled or were expelled from their homes many became refugees in Gaza in
8:15
the South suddenly yev and ODed saw
8:22
themselves differently from their parents not as minorities in someone else's country but as pioneers in a
8:29
country of their own ready to build it and defend it they moved to the South
8:36
near the borderline with Gaza it was there in a kabut where they
8:41
met for the first [Music]
8:50
time the first time I met him um he was 16 and I was
8:56
17 and we didn't really have this connection happening but when we arrived
9:02
at near o That's where some sort of a connection started to happen and he was
9:07
younger than I am um about a year and a half so at first I thought he's a kid
9:15
but for some reason he insisted odad really insisted and later it turned out
9:22
he was right what was it about him that made
9:27
you fall in love with him he was
9:35
cute he was a cute kid he was a cute
9:42
boy what what's so [Music]
9:48
funny philos he was a philosopher he wrote a
9:55
lot he worked in agriculture he was the cute boy he was only 20 think about
10:05
it and then I married him and he brought two things with him he brought a dog and
10:11
he brought a cactus and since then we've been growing a huge field of cacti for
10:18
over 64
10:26
[Music] years what did it feel like to be starting a
10:33
new life together in this new country what was the feeling of that
10:40
boria we were euphoric and what did you think you were
10:47
Building [Music]
10:58
Together we thought we were building kibuts we were building a family we were having
11:04
babies that was the vision and we were thinking that we were building a
11:10
socialist State an equal State and at first it was a very
11:17
isolated place there were only two houses and shacks and a lot of sand and
11:23
little by little we turn that place into a heaven building the new state meant
11:29
cultivating the land aded plowed the fields planting potatoes and carrots
11:34
wheat and cotton yv was in charge of the turkeys and worked in the kitchen cooking meals for the
11:41
kabut they believed that the best way to live was communally so they shared
11:46
everything money food even child rearing after long days in the fields a
11:54
dead would venture outside the Kuts to the boundary line with Gaza and drink beer with Brazilian peacekeepers from
12:01
the UN and talk with Palestinians from The Villages nearby they talked about
12:06
politics and life in Arabic a language a dead spoke fluently these were not just Idol
12:13
conversations a dead knew that for Israel to succeed it would have to figure out how to live side by side with
12:20
its Arab neighbors he really did not believe in black and white that somebody
12:26
is the bad guy and somebody is the good guy but that there is uh humanistic
12:32
values that you can live [Music]
12:38
in Shon what was your father
12:43
like tell tell her
12:50
um my father was a tall man and a skinny
12:56
man and he was
13:02
was he is first of all he is he is a a
13:08
man who had very strong
13:13
opinion um and very well-formed opinion he read extensively he thought deeply
13:21
about matters um and he studied the piano but as he said
13:28
was never that great or fast enough or classical but he always played the
13:41
piano he would play a lot of Israeli songs he will play Russian songs he
13:48
would play French sh [Music]
13:57
songs and he had this way of just moving from one song to the
14:03
next making it into a kind of pattern and it was it's really the soundtrack of
14:11
our life my father playing the [Music]
14:28
piano
14:37
so one side of him was the piano another side was he was a peace
14:44
activist he was not somebody who just had ideas about Building Bridges between
14:50
nations he was always on the left side of the political map and he actioned it
14:59
[Music]
15:06
I remember growing up and going very regularly almost weekly to demonstrations I will go regularly with
15:14
my father on Saturday night to demonstrations in Tel Aviv I will sit on his
15:19
shoulders um he will be talking to all his activist friends um the smoke will rise from the
15:27
cigarettes and I will sit up there um but
15:35
somehow we really grew up in that fight for
15:43
peace yourid and aed's formal Fight For Peace began after the Arab Israeli War
15:48
of 1967 Israel had captured new territory including the West Bank the Sinai
15:55
Peninsula and the Gaza Strip that brought more than a million Palestinians
16:00
under Israeli occupation adad immediately began to speak against it Israel already had its
16:08
land inside borders that much of the world had agreed to in his view taking
16:13
more was wrong it was no longer about Jewish survival so when Israeli authorities
16:20
began quietly pushing beduan Arabs off their land in the Sinai Peninsula a dead
16:26
took up the cause he helped file a case in the Israeli courts to try to stop it and he
16:33
and Y worked together to draw attention to what was going on yavid was a photographer so she took pictures
16:40
showing destroyed buildings and bulldozed land adad then put her photographs on
16:46
cardboard and drove around the country showing them to people everywhere they became part of a growing
16:53
peace movement that was becoming a force helping shape Israeli politics Israel eventually returned the
17:00
Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in 1982 Whenever there is a movement
17:06
towards reconciliation with our neighbors it's almost like your your ability to live here you know your life
17:14
force get stronger and in a way you can think of their kind of the the arch of
17:21
their activism as being a response to
17:26
that and why did he and your mother take up that fight the cause of the land why
17:33
do you think that was what he fought for my father he had a very developed
17:41
sense of justice and he always felt that had we
17:48
returned those lands at that point we could have reached long-term agreement at that point then we would have been in
17:56
a very different space now we know that in 2019 for example he wrote a column
18:03
where he said that when the Palestinians of Gaza have nothing to lose we lose big
18:08
time he believed that the way of living in this part of the world is to share
18:16
the place to reach agreement um to work with the other side
18:22
towards agreements and uh he was not somebody who just had IDE deals about
18:29
Building Bridges between nations he two weeks before he was taken hostage he
18:37
still drove Palestinian that are ill to reach Hospital in Israel and in East
18:43
Jerusalem that's was something that meant a lot to him I think he really
18:49
believed in shared humanity and in doing what you
18:56
can do you remember the last conversation you had with your
19:05
father I don't have a clear memory which one it was it's funny a lot of things I forgot
19:13
since I a lot of things have gone so
19:20
[Music]
19:27
blad [Music]
19:46
we actually didn't have a last conversation the last thing he said was
19:53
y there's a war and he was shot in the hand and he
19:59
was taken out and I was taken out I couldn't say goodbye to
20:06
him and what was done to us was
20:11
[Music]
20:27
done we'll be right
20:41
back yavid the last thing aded said was there's a war tell me about what
20:49
happened that day from the
20:57
beginning that morning there was very heavy
21:02
shelling on your rose we could hear gunfire and we looked outside and odad
21:08
told me there are a lot of terrorists outside we didn't even have time to get
21:13
dressed I was still wearing my night gown he was wearing very few clothes I remember him trying to close
21:21
the door to the safe room but it didn't work he wasn't successful in closing it
21:26
and then five terrorist walked in they shot him through the safe room door he
21:33
was bleeding from his arm he said to me I'm injured and then he fainted he
21:41
was dragged out on the floor and I didn't know if he was alive
21:48
I thought he was he was dead after that I was taken in my night
21:55
gown I was L outside I was placed on a small moped and I was taken to
22:06
Gaza and we were driving over a bumpy terrain that had been
22:12
plowed and it didn't break my ribs but it was very
22:20
painful and I could see that the gate that surrounds the Gaza Strip was broken
22:27
and we were driving right through
22:32
it and as we were heading in I could see so many people they were
22:40
yelling kill the Jews Slaughter the Jews and people were hitting me with
22:47
sticks and though the drivers on the moped tried to protect me it didn't
22:54
help what were you thinking at the time what was in your mind
23:03
I was thinking I'm being taken I'm being kidnapped I didn't know where to but
23:09
this decision I had in my head was that I'm going to take photographs in my mind
23:14
and capture everything I'm seeing so that when I or if and when I am released
23:21
I'll have what to [Music]
23:27
tell and when I came to a stop we were in a
23:35
village that's near near O It's called we came in on the moped but I was
23:43
transferred into a private car from there and I was threatened that my hand would be cut off unless I hand over my
23:51
watch and my ring and I didn't have a choice so I took my watch off and I took
23:56
my ring off and I handed it to them was it your wedding
24:04
ring yes it was my wedding
24:10
ring after that they led me to a big hanger where the entrance to the tunnel
24:18
was and I started walking and the entrance was at ground level but as you
24:25
walk you're walking down a slope and you're walking and walking about 40 m deep
24:31
underground and the walls are damp and the soil is damp and at first I was
24:39
alone I didn't know that other people had been taken too but then more more
24:44
hostages came and we were walking together through the
24:51
tunnels many of whom were from kibuts near o these were AR people they were
24:57
abducted but still alive and we spoke quietly and we spoke
25:04
very little but as we were walking everybody started telling a story of
25:10
what happened to him and that created a very painful
25:18
[Music] picture there were appalling stories
25:24
about murder people had left behind a partner
25:34
a friend arrived who about an hour or two hours before had her husband murdered and he died in her
25:44
[Music] hands it was a collection of broken up
25:52
people brought together so you were piecing together
25:57
the story of your community and what had happened from these snapshots of
26:04
tragedies that you were looking at all around you as you were walking what's the photograph you'll
26:11
remember most from that [Music] day a
26:19
child it would be a girl a four-year-old girl people kept telling her walk walk
26:27
walk and we tried to calm her down and her mom tried to carry her on her arms it
26:33
was the most difficult site to see a child inside those
26:41
tunnels what were you feeling at that moment
26:49
y very [Music]
26:57
difficult
27:02
where did they lead you you and your community from
27:11
near they led us to this chamber a room that they had prepared in advance there
27:16
were mattresses there and that's where we were told to
27:22
sit I saw people sitting on the mattresses bent down their heads down
27:27
between their hands they were broken but we hardly spoke everybody was inside
27:34
their own world with themselves closed inside his own personal
27:42
shock you havid was without her glasses her hearing aids or even her shoes she
27:48
said she spent most days lying down on one of the mattresses that had been put out for the
27:53
hostages sometimes her captors would let her and others walk up and down the tunnels to their
27:58
[Music] legs she said she was given a cucumber
28:04
spreading cheese and a piece of pea bread every day to eat they had a little bit of coffee in the morning and water
28:10
all day long one day a Hamas leader came to the
28:16
room where she and others were being held she said she believes it was yaka senoir the leader of Hamas who is
28:22
believed to be the architect of the October 7th attack two other hostages who were held with you also identified
28:29
the man as senoir and an Israeli military spokesman said he found the accounts
28:40
reliable he came accompanied with a group of other men he just made rounds between the
28:47
hostages I suppose and he spoke in Hebrew and he told us not to worry and soon there's
28:53
going to be a deal you will be out and and others told me don't speak and I
29:00
said what is there for me to be afraid of the worst already happened worst
29:05
thing I'll be killed I want to say something and I spoke my mind I told
29:12
senoir why have you done what you just did to all of the same people who have always helped you he didn't answer me he
29:19
just turned around and they walked off were you afraid to ask him why Hamas
29:28
did what it did to challenge
29:34
him I wasn't afraid I was angry about the whole
29:41
situation it was against every thought and thinking we ever had
29:46
it was against our desire to reach peace to be attentive and help our neighbors
29:54
the way we always wanted to help our neighbors I was very very angry but he ignored what I said and he just turned
30:01
his back and walked away and this entire time you had no
30:10
answers about
30:18
aad nothing what was the hardest day for you
30:24
the hardest moment in captivity
30:32
it's when I got sick I got sick with diarrhea and vomiting for about 4 days
30:39
and I had no idea how this will end it was a few very rough days and probably
30:46
because of that they decided to free me they didn't tell me they were going
30:52
to release me they just told me and another girl come follow us they gave
30:58
with galabia gowns to wear and scarves to wear over our heads so maybe they'll
31:04
think that we are Arab women and only as we were walking and we started going through Carters and
31:11
ladders and climbing up we were told that we're going
31:20
home I was very happy to be going out uh but my heart achd so hard
31:28
for those who were staying behind I was hoping that many others would follow
31:39
me name it's okay let's go it's okay let's go you go with this
31:51
swom there was a video that was made of the moment you left your captain
31:59
and it seemed to show that you were shaking a hand saying Shalom to them do
32:06
you remember doing [Music]
32:13
that I said goodbye to him it was a friendly man he was a medic so when we
32:20
said goodbye I shook his hand for peace Le Shalom to goodbye what did you mean when you said
32:30
that I meant for peace shalom in the sense of
32:39
[Music] Peace an extraordinary moment as a freed
32:46
Israeli hostage shakes hands with a Hamas terrorist who held her captive I
32:52
literally saw my mom on CNN on my phone on the way to the airport
32:58
and it was the day before I was talking to my aunt and she said I just want to
33:03
go to Gaza and pull them out of the earth I just want to pull them out of the earth and take them and it it really
33:11
felt like that that she came out of the earth and when she shook the hand of
33:17
theas person it just it just made me smile because it was so her to see the
33:24
human in that person and to acknowledge him as a human
33:32
being I arrived in the hospital at about 5:30
33:38
a.m. my mom was asleep in the bed and um
33:44
she was just my mom sleep really peacefully she has a really quiet way of
33:50
sleeping and I just sat there and it was just like a miracle to have her back
33:56
with us it was just incredible because not only
34:02
was she back but it was her I don't know how to explain it but while they were
34:08
away we knew so little we were pretty sure she didn't survive it the whole
34:15
house burned down totally so other homes we could see if there was blood on the
34:21
walls or blood on the floor but in my parents' home everything was gone
34:28
everything and we just didn't know anything and out of that
34:34
nothingness came my mom
34:39
[Music]
34:46
back it was only when she got to the hospital that y had learned the full story of what happened on October
34:53
7th near o had been mostly destroyed many of her friends had been
34:58
murdered no one knew what had happened to adad Y believed he was
35:04
dead but there wasn't time to grieve the photograph she had taken in her mind
35:10
needed to be shared yev knew who was still alive in the
35:15
tunnels so she and her son called as many families as they could the family
35:20
of the kabuta history teacher of one of its nurses of the person who ran its art
35:25
gallery to tell them that they were still alive captive in [Music]
35:31
Gaza and then in November came a hostage release more than 100 people came out
35:39
the family was certain that a dead was gone but Chiron decided to make some calls anyway she spoke to one former
35:45
neighbor then another and finally almost by chance she found someone who'd seen
35:51
her father they shared a room together in Gaza before he'd gotten ill and was taken away
35:58
Chiron and her brothers went to where yav was staying to tell her the news she just couldn't believe it
36:06
actually it was as if uh in this great telen Nolla of our life at one season he
36:14
was left unconscious on the floor and the second season open and he is in a is
36:21
in a little room in Gaza with another woman that we know she couldn't believe it she was
36:28
very very very um excited also really worried you know for my father was a
36:36
very active and strong man and if it happened 10 years ago I would say of
36:41
course he would survive it he would talk to them in Arabic he will manage the situation he would have
36:48
agency but we know he was injured and it makes us very very worried about the
36:55
condition in which he was uh uh is surviving there and I think that
37:02
um the fear of how much suffering the hostages are going through it really
37:09
makes you unable to function at
37:16
moment yavid the government has been doing a military operation since October in
37:24
Gaza you have been fighting very hard since October to free the hostages
37:31
including a dead I wonder how you see the government's military operation is
37:38
it something that harms your cause or potentially helps
37:50
it the only thing that will bring them back are agreements and what is
37:55
happening is that there are many soldiers who have been killed and there is an ongoing War and the hostages are
38:03
still in captivity so it's only by reaching an agreement that all of the
38:09
hostages will be released do you believe that Israel is close to reaching an
38:21
agreement I don't know you told us that after the
38:31
Holocaust your father gathered your family together to tell you that God did not
38:38
save you it was a crisis for him I'm wondering if this
38:45
experience October 7th your captivity challenged your faith in a
38:52
similar way
39:04
I don't think it changed me I'm still the same person with the same beliefs
39:11
and opinions but how should I say it what the Kamas did was to
39:18
ruin a certain belief in human beings I didn't think that what can reach that
39:26
level that isn't that much higher than a beast but my opinion and my view of
39:34
their still being peace and reaching an arrangement stayed the
39:41
same you still believe in peace Shalom
39:48
yes why do you believe
39:56
that I'm hoping that a a new generation of leaders will rise people who act in
40:03
transparency who speak the truth people who are honest the way Israel used to be
40:10
and that will return to be like we once
40:18
[Music]
40:26
were
40:31
I go to many rallies and demonstrations and I meet many people in many places
40:38
and a large part of those people still believe in reaching an arrangement in
40:44
peace and for there to be no war and I still hope that this is what we're going
40:49
to be able to have [Music]
40:56
here bring them up now bring them home now
41:01
bring them up now bring theming
41:07
them theming [Music]
41:25
theming you have it is now living in a retirement home in the suburbs of Tel Aviv five other people around her age
41:31
from near o live there too one is also a released hostage she hasn't been able to bring
41:38
herself to go back to the kots the life she built there with a dead is gone her
41:44
photographs his records the piano and the kabut has become something
41:50
else now a symbol instead of a home it is now buzzing with journalists and
41:55
politicians for for now y doesn't know if she'll ever go back and when Chiron
42:01
asked her she said let's wait for
42:10
Dad so I'm today sitting in this uh Assisted Living surrounded by the same company
42:18
just expecting a dead waiting for a dead to come back and then each and every one of us will be rebuilding his own life
42:27
together and renewing it what are you doing to make it a home
42:34
for a dead we have a piano we were given a
42:41
piano a very old one was a beautiful sound and it's good odad is very
42:47
sensitive to the sound he has absolute hearing and I'm just hoping for him to come home and start playing the
42:55
piano do you believe that I did will come [Music]
43:05
home I'd like to believe but there's a difference between believing and wanting I want to
43:12
believe that he'll be back and playing music I don't think his opinions are going to change he's going to be
43:19
disappointed by what happened but I hope he's going to hold on to the same
43:25
beliefs his music is missing from our [Music]
43:41
home I know that my father always felt that we haven't given peace a chance
43:50
that was his opinion and I think it's very hard to speak for my father because
43:56
maybe he had has changed like my mom said she said I hope he hasn't changed I
44:02
haven't changed but the truth is we don't know and we don't know the story we don't know how the story uh my father
44:10
is ending or just beginning um but I think you have to hold on to
44:19
humanistic values at this point you have to know that what you don't want I don't
44:26
want more of this this is hell this is hell for everybody so this is no you
44:32
know and then I believe that peace is also gray and it's not glorious and it's
44:42
not simple it's kind of a lot of hard work
44:47
you have to reconcile and give up a lot and it's only worth doing that for
44:56
peace [Music]
