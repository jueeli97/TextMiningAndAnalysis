An Arms Race Quietly Unfolds in Space



0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael babbaro
0:03
this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:12
daily today us officials now acknowledge
0:16
a growing fear that Russia may be trying
0:19
to put a nuclear weapon into Earth's
0:22
orbit but as my colleague Eric Lipton
0:25
explains their real worry is that
0:28
America could lose the battle for
0:30
military Supremacy in
0:35
space it's Wednesday February
0:39
[Music]
0:44
28th Eric this story began in a pretty
0:47
unusual way I actually watched it unfold
0:49
on social media in real time and it
0:52
started with a very cryptic message from
0:56
a member of Congress so just tell us
0:58
about that sure well representative Mike
1:01
Turner who's chairman of the house
1:02
intelligence committee put out a message
1:05
saying today the house permanent select
1:08
committee on intelligence has made
1:09
available to all members of Congress
1:11
information that he had information
1:13
concerning a serious national security
1:16
threat and it was an unusual kind of a
1:19
of a statement from the chairman of the
1:21
house intelligence committee I'm
1:22
requesting that President Biden
1:24
declassify all information relating to
1:26
this threat so that Congress the
1:29
administration and our so he didn't
1:31
really tell us what this was about but
1:33
he he just told us to be very scared yes
1:36
and it immediately set off a scramble of
1:38
National Security reporters to try to
1:40
figure out what that message meant MH
1:43
and pretty quickly Congressman Turner is
1:46
referring to a foreign military
1:48
capability and that foreign military is
1:51
the Russian military reporters heard
1:54
that this had to do with Russia and with
1:56
a new type of military
1:58
threat and what exactly was this new
2:01
kind of military threat the intelligence
2:03
that our New York Times colleagues have
2:04
collected is that Russia is preparing to
2:07
put a weapon in space that would blow up
2:10
a nuclear device and when it did that it
2:13
would be used to Target United States
2:16
surveillance
2:18
[Music]
2:21
satellites okay so here we need to slow
2:24
down and explain what that means why
2:28
it's so alarming
2:30
why nukes would ever be in space so just
2:34
kind of disentangle all of that I think
2:38
that few Americans realize just how
2:40
vital space is to the military defense
2:43
of the United States for decades the
2:45
United States has been building
2:47
effectively School bus-sized satellites
2:50
that cost a massive amounts of money
2:52
through these Exquisite systems that
2:55
just sit there in space and provide
2:57
incredible information and we rely upon
3:02
all of the assets that we have for you
3:04
know navigation for communication for
3:07
missile defense for missile targeting
3:09
and it's something that is one of the
3:12
great powers of the United States is to
3:14
have all of this equipment floating
3:15
around above us but the real flaw in the
3:19
United States military space system is
3:23
that there aren't very many of them and
3:26
you don't have to take out too many of
3:28
them to severely disable the United
3:30
States capacities got it so back to this
3:33
Congressman Turner and his message why
3:36
would the Russians need a nuclear
3:39
element to their efforts to challenge
3:42
America's satellite programs in space
3:45
Russia sees potentially a nuclear weapon
3:49
as a way to take out large numbers of
3:51
satellites in an instant wow it would
3:54
fry them it would destroy them it would
3:56
create all kinds of debris in space and
3:58
I think what's really going on on here
4:00
is the Russians in the early stages of
4:03
their invasion of Ukraine were really
4:05
frustrated that they were not able to
4:07
really block the ability of the
4:09
Ukrainian military to continue to
4:11
communicate and that's because the
4:13
Ukrainian military was relying on SpaceX
4:16
and Elon Musk and his network of
4:18
starlink satellites to continue to
4:22
operate and it was actually in late 2022
4:25
when the Russians said you know what
4:27
those American satellites are getting in
4:30
our way and we may choose to Target
4:34
those satellites in the future and I
4:35
think that's what might be going on
4:37
right now got it so Russia has decided
4:40
that a way for it to achieve any kind of
4:43
military advantage over the US and have
4:46
success in things like its invasion of
4:48
Ukraine is to be able to threaten the
4:52
United States satellite infrastructure
4:55
in space in such a way that might make
4:58
it hard for the US
5:00
to effectively fight back against Russia
5:03
that's right I mean on the ground
5:04
Russia's been using what they call GPS
5:07
jamers to disrupt the signals from
5:10
satellites that are coming down in
5:11
Ukraine on the ground as they're
5:13
fighting the war but everything from the
5:16
location of the soldier on the ground to
5:18
when there's a missile that's launched
5:20
that's targeted in the United States to
5:22
how a ship communicates with another
5:24
ship everything goes through space and I
5:27
think that's one of the weakest points
5:29
that the United States has and it's the
5:31
ability to mess up or disable their
5:33
space-based Communications targeting
5:36
surveillance H you're saying that when a
5:39
rival like Russia thinks about how it
5:41
could actually and efficiently take out
5:44
America's eyes and ears of our entire
5:47
military it turns out there's really
5:48
only one answer and that's by doing it
5:50
in space right it doesn't matter how big
5:53
and powerful the weapon systems are if
5:55
they can't Target and they can't
5:57
communicate they're basically useless
6:00
okay so if you believe that Russia could
6:04
put a nuclear weapon in space that could
6:06
hurt our ability to have eyes and ears
6:07
on what they're doing that would be very
6:09
scary but how confident are we that
6:12
Vladimir Putin can in fact put a nuclear
6:15
weapon in space that's capable of doing
6:18
that given that in fact there's already
6:21
been nuclear tests in space in the
6:23
1960s the idea of them doing this is not
6:27
out of the realm of technical
6:28
possibility
6:30
it would be a violation of an
6:31
international treaty but you know Russia
6:33
hasn't shown much concern about
6:35
violating International treaties so I
6:37
don't think technically it would be that
6:39
much of a challenge it would destabilize
6:42
the world because suddenly you'd have
6:43
nuclear weapons in space and it would
6:46
cross a line that so far no one has
6:48
crossed but the notion can it be done I
6:51
think it could be done and I guess the
6:53
question is not just can it be done but
6:55
how confident is the US that Russia
6:58
intends to do it and how quickly that's
7:01
really unclear and I think that there's
7:03
a lot of speculation even about exactly
7:05
what this weapon might be it could be a
7:08
nuclear-powered anti-satellite device
7:11
that blows out satellites but just be
7:14
nuclear powered it could be a nuclear
7:16
weapon in space that explodes and blows
7:19
out anything anywhere nearby and we
7:22
don't know when this potential Russian
7:25
weapon is going to go up into orbit or
7:27
whether or not in fact it ever really
7:29
will
7:33
but what this does show a bit is that
7:36
it's a bit of a Hail Mary by Russia a
7:39
way to try to exert its influence in
7:42
space at a moment when Russia is
7:44
actually a declining power relative to
7:47
the other nations in the
7:48
world just explain that how can Russia
7:51
be a declining power right now in space
7:54
Russia is not launching nearly as
7:57
frequently as it had been
8:00
and its whole infrastructure around
8:02
building new satellites is in Decline
8:05
particularly compared to China which is
8:07
launching at a crazy Pace right now and
8:10
putting up all kinds of new commercial
8:13
communication systems but also devices
8:16
that could become offensive weapons
8:18
against the United
8:19
States so at the end of the day when I
8:21
talk to people at the Pentagon despite
8:24
the noise that Russia's making about
8:26
potentially putting a nuclear weapon in
8:28
space the biggest threat to United
8:31
States in space is actually
8:33
[Music]
8:36
China we'll be right
8:39
[Music]
8:45
back so Eric we started off talking
8:47
about the threat that it seemed Russia
8:50
posed to the United States because of
8:52
its willingness to potentially put a
8:54
nuclear weapon in space now you're
8:57
saying that for the US military the real
9:00
threat in space is China so just explain
9:04
that China as of at least the last
9:07
decade as part of a overall significant
9:10
surge in its military capacity space has
9:14
been an incredibly intense focus it has
9:17
been launching at a really rapid Pace
9:21
far ahead of Russia and it's not only
9:24
putting communication satellites up
9:26
there but it's putting systems that
9:29
could potentially grab on to move and
9:33
Disable American Military satellites
9:36
well how does that work I mean how how
9:37
does something that they launch into
9:38
space grab onto an American satellite
9:42
well in January
9:44
2022 China put a satellite into space
9:48
that had an arm that reached out and
9:50
grabbed another satellite that was there
9:53
in geoc syncronous orbit and it dragged
9:56
it to a different
9:58
location
10:00
so basically they found a way to put a
10:02
tow truck up in space and showed that if
10:05
they wanted to they could move any
10:07
satellite that's right they showed that
10:09
they had the ability to not only send
10:11
satellites up there but to send trucks
10:14
that had the capacity to grab onto maybe
10:17
an enemy's you know surveillance system
10:19
and basically put it into a dead
10:23
zone another thing that China did was in
10:26
2007 this is quite a while ago they
10:29
launched the missile up to about 530
10:32
miles Which is far into space and they
10:35
destroyed another satellite that was in
10:38
orbit and it created an incredible cloud
10:41
of space debris the largest amount of
10:44
space debris ever tracked and it was
10:47
quite a worrisome thing for the United
10:48
States to see that China has the
10:50
capacity to launch missiles from the
10:51
ground that would destroy satellites and
10:53
blow them up in low earth
10:57
orbit got it so both examples that you
10:59
just described are much more targeted
11:02
than what Russia is contemplating you
11:03
know moving one satellite or using a
11:05
missile to take one out but the upshot
11:09
is that China can disrupt our eyes and
11:12
ears in space in a probably better more
11:15
efficient way than Russia and you're
11:17
saying given how much stuff they' put up
11:19
in space they're more likely to already
11:21
be able to do it than Russia which is
11:23
still trying to get to that point right
11:25
I mean the big difference between Russia
11:27
and China right now is that space threat
11:29
is that China is moving rapidly on both
11:33
offensive and defensive systems China is
11:36
talking about building a state network
11:38
of 13,000 satellites that's I mean on a
11:42
scale that's just completely outside of
11:45
what Russia is attempting to do China is
11:47
investing a lot more money and it's
11:49
moving much faster right now to put new
11:52
systems in space and those systems are
11:54
both going to threaten United States
11:56
satellites and also have a kind of a
11:59
surveillance that would almost rival the
12:01
United States so I want to understand
12:05
where the US sits in all of this because
12:07
when it comes to space it feels like the
12:09
thing that would make the US military so
12:12
anxious about a rival's advancements in
12:16
space is if we couldn't match them or we
12:19
couldn't properly respond to them so
12:21
what is the US Readiness right now to
12:24
basically match or fight back against
12:27
whatever Russia and China are doing in
12:29
space everyone I talked to from the
12:32
Pentagon and also former Pentagon
12:34
officials uh all agree that the United
12:36
States maintains clear dominance in
12:39
space it has more satellites for
12:41
surveillance and missile targeting and
12:43
missile defense than any other Nation
12:46
both the United States and China have
12:49
moved in a really rapid way into a new
12:51
domain and that is low earth
12:55
orbit that's about no greater than 1200
12:58
miles off the surface of the Earth and
13:01
it's the area where SpaceX has put more
13:03
than 5,000 satellites for its starlink
13:06
system that's the Focus right now is the
13:08
flood that zone with lots of relatively
13:11
cheap quickly manufactured easy to
13:14
replace satellite systems and the United
13:17
States wants to put you know at least a
13:19
thousand satellites into low earth orbit
13:21
for its military purposes in the next
13:23
several
13:24
years among the many concerns that the
13:27
American Military has is that China is
13:29
moving so rapidly right now to build out
13:32
its own system that unless the United
13:35
States really accelerates what it's
13:36
doing that soon China could be close to
13:39
matching what the US has in space and
13:41
that China now has enough surveillance
13:44
capacity in space to Target American
13:48
Military capacity in any type of a
13:52
conflict I mean imagine you know the
13:54
scenario where China decides to invade
13:57
Taiwan and the United States decides
13:59
that it's going to help defend Taiwan if
14:02
all of our military assets are
14:04
immediately visible to China they could
14:06
be targeted even before they got to the
14:09
Taiwan Straits or even before they got
14:11
within range to have a military
14:13
engagement and
14:15
simultaneously China's offensive space
14:18
weapons were disabling American
14:20
satellites so that the United States
14:22
could no longer communicate that's the
14:24
fear that the military has right now is
14:25
both of those things could suddenly
14:27
happen if the United States is not
14:29
building up its own space capacity and
14:33
its space weapons to disable Chinese
14:37
[Music]
14:44
satellites got it so the worry and it's
14:47
very specific is that if China can
14:49
achieve the same level of military
14:51
prowess in space as the us then the US
14:54
loses any power it has to deter China
14:58
from doing something like invade Taiwan
15:00
because we know and they know that we
15:03
know that they can basically shut down
15:06
our systems before and during that
15:08
Invasion and make it impossible for us
15:10
to stop them it would severely degrade
15:13
military capacity if they could wipe out
15:16
a good share of our satellites and
15:18
they're racing to try to avoid that so
15:21
Eric what does it look like for the US
15:22
to race to avoid China meeting America's
15:27
capabilities where they currently are I
15:29
mean how does the US military do that
15:32
obviously it would need to either slow
15:34
China down or the US itself would need
15:37
to speed up and race ahead of China
15:41
there's two primary things that are
15:42
happening right now one is to build out
15:45
us offensive systems to disable Chinese
15:49
or Russian satellites so that includes
15:52
jamming systems they just signed a new
15:55
contract to build new devices that could
15:57
Jam Chinese are Russian satellites and
15:59
and disrupt their signals laser systems
16:02
that could destroy satellites from the
16:04
ground or from space and also other
16:07
systems that they just like the Chinese
16:08
have built a tug in Space the United
16:11
States potentially is going to build its
16:12
own systems that could grab and disable
16:15
other satellites in space the second
16:18
piece of this plank is to build out a
16:21
massive investment in space capacity by
16:24
the United States to build a whole new
16:27
architecture in low Earth orbit with
16:29
hundreds if not more than a thousand
16:32
satellites that would be so many so
16:34
redundant that you couldn't effectively
16:37
disable the United States military
16:39
capacity because even if you were to
16:41
shoot out a certain number of them there
16:43
would be yet more of them sort of like
16:45
starlink right now the SpaceX starlink
16:47
if it loses a certain number of its
16:49
5,800 satellites they just switch and
16:52
they rebuild the network among the
16:54
remaining satellites basically everyone
16:56
knows that the next time there's a major
16:58
war with a major power that there's
17:00
going to be offensive activity in space
17:02
and both sides are preparing for that
17:05
wow I mean what you're clearly
17:07
describing is a new space race a space
17:11
race that's about which of these three
17:13
Global superpowers can take out the
17:16
others satellites and use their
17:18
satellites offensively and defensively
17:21
to achieve military Supremacy yeah
17:24
that's right I think that there's a new
17:25
space race that's underway right now and
17:27
it is more int
17:29
than at any time since really the 1960s
17:31
when the United States and Russia were
17:34
testing weapons in space for the first
17:36
time and it is very intense and the
17:39
increase in spending on Space right now
17:41
radically exceeds anything that the Navy
17:44
or that you know the traditional Air
17:46
Force or the Army is doing more dollars
17:48
are pouring into space defense right now
17:50
as a percentage increase it's more than
17:52
any other part of the
17:54
military Eric this makes me wonder how
17:57
much the US in its efforts to do those
17:59
two things you just described out in
18:02
space is ultimately ryant on contractors
18:06
the private sector and in particular
18:08
Elon Musk right this guy who has put so
18:11
many satellites up in the sky but who's
18:14
Mercurial and unique to put it
18:17
diplomatically so is the US plan for
18:19
staying ahead of both Russia and China
18:22
to ultimately put more and more power in
18:25
the hands of Elon Musk right now there's
18:29
no question that SpaceX and Elon Musk
18:32
plays an extraordinarily dominant role
18:35
in the ability to launch to orbit and
18:37
the military is excessively reliant on
18:41
SpaceX so at this moment it's an
18:44
uncomfortable kind of Domination by
18:46
SpaceX of the 9,400 objects in orbit
18:50
right now
18:52
5,235 of them are SpaceX starlink
18:55
satellites so almost all of the
18:57
satellites in orbit that from any nation
18:59
in the world are Elon Musk but the
19:02
Department of Defense realizes that it
19:04
can't be so Reliant upon one company for
19:06
launch and so the Pentagon is also
19:08
signing contracts with small launch
19:11
companies to quickly be able to put
19:13
military satellites into space with just
19:15
a few days notice wow and so there
19:17
there's a lot of money that's being
19:19
spent to build out this capacity right
19:22
so what you're really saying is that
19:23
this new space race is going to come
19:26
with and Foster a new space military
19:30
industrial complex that's going to be
19:32
the recipient of many billions maybe
19:35
trillions of dollars in taxpayer money
19:38
that's right I mean the the United
19:40
States is already in the middle of an
19:42
incredible explosion in the commercial
19:44
space industry because the number of
19:46
commercial launches is growing at a
19:48
really crazy rate and in the entire
19:50
world right now there are approximately
19:53
10,000 objects in orbit and within the
19:56
next 10 years the expectation there's
19:59
going to be something like
20:00
25,000 satellites in orbit so there's a
20:03
there's a huge boom right now in the
20:05
space industry
20:07
globally so Eric when I step back it
20:10
feels like the inevitable outcome of
20:13
this new space race this weapons space
20:15
race is a very potentially expensive
20:19
version of what we already have which is
20:22
that famous concept of mutually assured
20:25
destruction right it's this idea that
20:27
all three of these countries have
20:29
nuclear weapons and it keeps us all in
20:31
check Russia China the us we don't
20:33
attack each other directly because we
20:35
all fear that the other country attacked
20:38
would fire back in obliterating ways
20:41
that would never make it worth it and so
20:43
isn't that kind of where we're headed
20:46
with this battle over space all three
20:49
countries are going to be spending a
20:50
tremendous amount of money eventually to
20:53
reach some kind of loose parody that
20:57
prevents us all from doing something
20:59
really horrible to the other
21:01
country I mean I sort of reject your
21:03
premise and I think that in fact the
21:06
thing that the United States is
21:07
concerned about is it has had such a
21:09
massive advantage in space for so long
21:11
and it's been so Central to our global
21:15
Military Supremacy and suddenly if you
21:18
have another Nation that's kind of
21:20
walking in and and becoming your rival
21:23
in that environment I mean that's really
21:25
worrisome to the American Military and
21:27
their deter to prevent China from
21:30
matching the United States military
21:32
capacity in space H you're saying this
21:35
is not about the three countries ever
21:37
achieving parody it's about the US
21:40
ensuring that parody is never achieved
21:43
because if it's achieved then everything
21:47
changes right I think that basically the
21:49
Pentagon wants to ensure that it can
21:52
maintain dominance in space and not just
21:56
parity because space space dominance is
21:59
so vital to the way that the United
22:01
States military has operated for years
22:04

back here's what else you need to
22:42
another day on Tuesday President Biden
22:45
summoned House and Senate leaders to the
22:47
White House in an attempt to avoid the
22:50
latest potential government
22:52
shutdown that shutdown which could begin
22:55
at midnight on Saturday would be the
22:57
result of strident demands from House
23:00
Republicans who have attached right-wing
23:03
policies to basic spending bills that
23:05
have made them impossible to pass in the
23:08
Senate we believe that we can get to
23:10
agreement on these issues and prevent a
23:12
government shutdown and that's our first
23:14
uh responsibility as he left the White
23:16
House Republican house Speaker Mike
23:18
Johnson expressed optimism that a
23:21
shutdown would be averted and we have
23:23
been working in good faith Around the
23:25
Clock every single day for months and in
23:28
weeks and over the last several days
23:30
quite literally around the clock to get
23:32
that job done we're
23:34
[Music]
23:36
very and in a rebuke to President Biden
23:40
more than a 100,000 Democratic voters in
23:43
Michigan cast protest ballots that
23:46
declared themselves uncommitted to
23:49
express disapproval of the president's
23:51
handling of the war in Gaza that number
23:55
far exceeded the goal of 10 ,000
23:58
uncommitted ballots that activists had
24:01
set for themselves and could spell
24:03
trouble for Biden in the general
24:06
election Michigan is a key swing state

where Biden defeated Donald Trump in
