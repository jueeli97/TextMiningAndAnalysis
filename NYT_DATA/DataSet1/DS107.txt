How China Broke One Manâ€™s Dreams



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Michael babo
0:03
this is the
0:05
[Music]
0:10
daily
0:12
today a crisis of confidence is brewing
0:16
inside China where the heavy hand of the
0:19
government is turning True Believers in
0:21
the Chinese dream into Skeptics willing
0:25
to flee the
0:26
country my colleague leeu on how that
0:30
crisis is now showing up at the US
0:34
Mexico
0:39
border it's Thursday February
0:43
[Music]
0:45
15th Lee you write about China for the
The daring gap
0:48
Times tell us how it is that you first
0:51
came to this story you know I watch a
0:54
lot of Chinese social media for my job
0:58
and in early 202 three I started seeing
1:02
something quite surprising for me I saw
1:06
all these videos on social media of
1:09
Chinese people crossing the US border
1:11
with Mexico by taking the root what we
1:15
call the daring Gap and most people
1:18
taking the daring Gap are from Venezuela
1:22
Ecuador and heti but what felt so
1:26
unneutral for Chinese people taking this
1:29
journey is that unlike these other
1:32
groups these Chinese are fleeing the
1:35
world's second largest economy right
1:38
they are not in most of the Public's
1:40
imagination in the same boat as the
1:44
migrants from any of the countries we
1:46
think of where people are fleeing
1:49
violence and poverty and taking this
1:52
very dangerous route the daring Gap yeah
1:56
and how many Chinese migrants are we
1:58
talking about here you know know last
2:00
year in
2:02
2023 24,000 Chinese crossed the southern
2:06
border 24,000 yeah that's more than the
2:09
previous 10 years combined wow and you
2:12
know if we step back and look at the
2:15
history China used to be a big country
2:19
for migration a lot of people were
2:22
leaving trying very hard to leave China
2:24
in 1980s when China was a very poor
2:26
country and then as the economy grew
2:30
life became much better the
2:31
opportunities were abundant and there
2:34
were like hundreds of millions of
2:36
Chinese middle class and by
2:39
2012 very few Chinese were leaving and
2:43
about 80% of Chinese who studied abroad
2:46
people like me went back to China
2:50
because why leave China right you could
2:54
have Chinese dream as a play on The
2:56
American Dream right yeah the American
2:57
dream you know we grew up watching in
3:00
Hollywood movies you know we all know
3:02
the term and then the Communist Party
3:05
kind
3:06
of coopted the term and became the
3:10
Chinese dream and many Chinese bought
3:14
into that but in recent years the
3:17
numbers of people living China have
3:20
again started to go up and actually
3:24
hundreds of thousands of Chinese
3:26
citizens left the country last year and
3:29
the Chinese migrants who cross the
3:31
daring Gap represent those who are going
3:36
to the most extreme lands to leave the
3:39
country mhm and so I've been really
3:42
interested in finding out why are they
3:44
doing this and what do you come to
An example
3:47
understand about why thousands of
3:50
Chinese migrants are making this journey
3:54
what what explains it it might be better
3:57
if I can give you an example a man I
4:02
met his name
4:05
is he 39 years old and he s he realized
4:11
the Chinese dream and ended up on the
4:13
Darren
4:17
Gap he was born in China's Eastern
4:21
Province Shandon in a poor
4:26
Village he said he grew up like only two
4:30
meals with meat a year and he didn't
4:34
finish middle school
4:36
[Music]
4:38
and he worked hard labor making very
4:42
little money but he dreamed about the
4:46
world outside his
4:51
village so he went to work at an
4:54
Electronics Factory in Beijing making
4:57
about $300 dollar a month which was a
5:02
fortune for
5:05
him and he has a lot of street smart you
5:09
can sense it when you're talking to him
5:11
so after a few years he started working
5:15
for kind of like a Human Resources
5:17
company recruiting Factory workers just
5:20
like him and then by 2007 he made some
5:27
money and he leased a plot of land on
5:31
the upskirts of Beijing and build an
5:35
apartment building and the rent it out
5:38
to migrant workers huh so he basically
5:41
becomes a small scale almost developer
5:45
yeah a very small skill developer and uh
5:48
he did pretty well you know he was
5:50
making about
5:52
$30,000 a year which was pretty good
5:55
money for anybody in China at the
5:58
time and he got married and he had a
6:02
daughter and a few years later he had a
6:07
son he moved his parents from their
6:10
Village to Beijing which was a big
6:12
success in Chinese culture and he really
6:17
believed he kind of made
6:20
it and his life was only going to become
6:23
better and
6:26
better and what you're describing feels
A success story
6:29
like a middle class existence in China's
6:32
capital a success story not exactly the
6:35
kind of person you would expect to leave
6:39
China yeah you know the Chinese
6:42
government likes talking about hundreds
6:44
of millions of Chinese lifted out of
6:47
poverty you know he was one of them but
6:51
then in 2018 everything changed for
6:58
G he got a notice from the local
7:01
government that they wanted to take back
7:03
the land he leased and tear down the
7:06
apartment building he had built the
7:09
building he had built and subdivided
7:13
yeah the government wanted to use the
7:15
land to sell it for big bucks to bigger
7:18
developers essentially the government
7:20
just wants to override the lease that he
7:24
has for this land they just don't seem
7:26
to respect it and they're putting up the
7:28
sign and saying to him it's over
7:32
yeah and the government ordered everyone
7:36
in G building to
7:40
leave go is like no way and he refused
7:44
to
7:46
leave but the government cut off the
7:48
water the power and they throw away the
7:52
tenants belongings on the
7:56
street and they dumped toilet sewage in
7:59
the yard because they wanted to make it
8:02
unable for the people and then on that
8:06
day when the government came with police
8:09
and bulldozers to tear the building down
8:12
he said he stood on the roof of the
8:19
building he said he was so angry his
8:23
eyes just blacked
8:27
out he had a break in his hand he want
8:31
Breck in his hand yes he wanted to throw
8:33
it and fight the police the government
8:37
officials and his mom knelt down in
8:40
front of him backed him not to fight you
8:44
can't fight the government just get over
8:47
with it carry on with your
8:51
life
8:56
I and he told me he just has
9:00
[Music]
9:06
[Music]
9:14
cried so what does GA end up doing after
What happens next
9:18
the government takes away his land and
9:21
this building well God didn't want to
9:24
give up he decided to go to the higher
9:26
authority the central government to
9:29
petition his case he thought at least he
9:31
could demand some compensation for what
9:34
he had lost but during that process he
9:37
said he and his family started getting
9:41
harassed by local authorities they even
9:45
went to his Children's School to ask the
9:48
students with the same last name gal to
9:51
stand up to stand up in the classroom
9:53
yeah to intimidate basically it got so
9:57
bad that he legally divorced his wife to
10:00
try to trick the authorities to stop
10:03
harassing her and her parents wow and
10:05
meanwhile he had lost income from the
10:08
apartment building he was trying to make
10:12
a living doing odd jobs and this went
10:15
down for several years and at the end of
10:18
it g got absolutely nothing in return
10:21
for the loss of his
10:28
property
10:33
and at that time he started to think
10:37
about his
10:41
[Music]
10:47
world he said I felt like I suddenly
10:51
woke
10:54
up he said you know he just found out
10:57
there's no way to pursue Justice in his
11:02
[Music]
11:04
country he told me I felt like I finally
11:07
saw through this country's reality saw
11:11
right through
11:19
it his outlook for the country and for
11:22
his own future just became very dark
11:26
that was what he
11:27
said
11:31
so at this point it seems safe to say
11:33
that his version of the Chinese dream
11:36
has collaps and I wonder as he's telling
11:39
you this story Lee what you make of
11:41
it to be honest if you a China
11:45
correspondent you cover China this is
11:48
the type of story you hear again and
11:52
again the space for the society just
11:56
shrank so much in the past decade or so
12:01
under the government of
12:03
shining it has become really hard for
12:07
people from all kinds of social economic
12:09
backgrounds you can get into trouble for
12:12
anything for being a wiger Christian
12:16
Muslim well you're just um ordinary
12:19
online user just making a comment on
12:22
social media well you're just a
12:24
Communist Party C who has a copy of a
12:27
ban book and you can be in trouble the
12:30
police can show up at your door in the
12:33
middle of the night the knock on the
12:36
door and everything goes away yeah you
12:39
just live in constant fear H and all of
12:44
this are happening at the same time when
12:47
the unemployment rate is rising right
12:51
and the Chinese economy is falling
12:55
apart people just can't see where their
12:59
future is going to be the loss of
13:03
confidence is you can feel it in the air
13:07
that's what people told
13:08
me so this is the moment that the idea
13:12
of the Chinese dream you work very hard
13:15
and the life will become better kind of
13:19
is clashing with the reality of the
13:22
Chinese
13:27
government
13:29
and it's this moment that go saw the
13:31
videos I saw on social media of people
13:36
crossing the daring
13:38
[Music]
13:41
Gap and he thought to himself that I can
13:45
do this
13:57
too
14:02
we'll be right
14:04
[Music]
14:15
back once Scout decides to leave China
Leaving China
14:18
why does he decide to leave this way why
14:21
not go to a nearby neighboring country
14:24
in Asia why not go to Europe why travel
14:28
across the ocean to the us through such
14:31
a particularly terrifyingly dangerous
14:34
route as the daring capap yeah for many
14:38
Chinese people you know it's pretty
14:40
obvious that the US is the country they
14:42
should move to because it is the
14:44
wealthiest country in the world and the
14:47
wages are much higher here than in most
14:50
countries and also the US still looms
14:54
large in the imagination of Chinese
14:57
people you know from many people the
14:59
American dream never died mhm the
15:03
problem is it's not easy for ordinary
15:06
Chinese people like G to get any kinds
15:09
of visa to go directly to the US H but
15:13
Chinese passport holders can fly
15:16
directly to Ecuador without a Visa and
15:20
from there there's a well traveled pass
15:23
to the daring Gap so many Chinese people
15:27
just think that going from Ecuador to
15:30
the daring Gap is actually one of the
15:33
best options for them to get to the
15:35
United States but how aware is G of what
15:40
is entailed in walking from Ecuador to
15:45
the US border through that landscape he
15:48
was aware of the
15:52
danger he told me he knew that people
15:55
died on the root but
16:00
he told me his life was so risky so
16:05
dangerous so uncertain in China he
16:08
decided he might just as well leave to
16:12
start a new
16:15
life G had never been out of China and
16:19
he didn't even have a passport he
16:21
applied for a passport after he decided
16:24
to
16:26
leave and he also convinced his family
16:29
to let him bring his eldest child his
16:31
13-year-old daughter to come with
16:36
him and they left Beijing late February
16:41
last
16:43
year they flew to Turkey and then to
16:50
Ecuador and got connected with
16:53
Smugglers who took them to the daring
16:57
Gap it was such a brutal Journey God
17:01
told
17:04
me on the first day he had s
17:09
stroke on the second day he could barely
17:12
walk and his daughter vomited and
17:17
fainted on the
17:21
ground I asked him what was going
17:24
through his mind during the journey he
17:27
said it was this
17:31
there but he just told his daughter we
17:34
have to keep going we can't get left
17:39
behind the journey took 35 days they
17:43
reached the Border in late March and
17:47
crossed from Mexico into
17:51
Texas they were taken by border control
17:55
agents go told his story about what he's
18:00
experienced in China and he was let
18:04
go this is where it feels like gal's
Life in San Francisco
18:07
story seems to intersect with a very
18:10
long running story in the United States
18:12
which is what's going on at the border
18:14
thousands tens of thousands a week
18:17
migrants showing up at that southern
18:19
border seeking Asylum and because
18:22
there's such a backlog to process the
18:24
applications folks are LED into the US
18:27
and here that seems to be what happened
18:29
to G and his daughter yeah g and his
18:32
daughter they were lucky they were let
18:35
go within 48 hours and immigration agent
18:39
sent them to San Francisco and that's
18:42
where he and his daughter have been ever
18:45
since and what does his life look like
18:48
in San
18:49
Francisco so go and his daughter are
18:53
living in a studio apartment at a
18:55
Housing Shelter
18:57
there
18:59
he got a work permit and has been
19:02
working delivering packages for $2 per
19:09
package he gets up at 6:00 a.m. every
19:13
morning and his daughter has to get up
19:16
around the same time because she cannot
19:19
be at the family shelter
19:24
alone so she would stay at the KFC until
19:28
his school
19:32
time he works really really long
19:36
hours and he told me he cries when he
19:39
thinks about leaving her alone this
19:42
sounds like a very difficult existence I
19:45
mean the kind of difficult existence
19:48
that might make somebody wonder if they
19:50
had made the right decision you know
19:53
life isn't easy for him and his daughter
19:57
but go is focusing on what the US is
20:01
giving
20:04
him he said the Chinese government took
20:07
away his building and he can't believe
20:10
the US government gave him a apartment
20:13
to leave for
20:16
free and one thing he emphasized is the
20:19
freedom he has here he doesn't need to
20:22
fear for the knock on the door
20:27
anymore
20:29
I asked him are you idolizing the us too
20:34
much
20:37
so and he kept telling me no no no I
20:40
never regreted my decision of coming
20:47
here and he told me a story of one
20:50
afternoon in November when was in San
20:54
Francisco to meet with President
20:57
Biden
20:58
and G saw on social media that there
21:01
would be a protest in San Francisco so
21:04
he actually took the day off and went
21:10
downtown he said he joined a group of
21:13
protesters and started
21:16
chanting stepped
21:21
down and he was actually interviewed by
21:24
a Chinese media Outlet at the scene
21:30
he sent me the clip And the reporter
21:33
asked him why are you here he said
21:37
freedom is
21:39
great then he shouted lonely
21:43
Freedom step
21:49
down he told me he felt
21:56
amazing he said in China I wouldn't dare
22:00
say
22:02
that but this were heartfelt words and I
22:06
could finally shout them
22:10
out he said he felt like a completely
22:13
different person after that
22:16
H so what's the most likely outcome of
22:20
this story for gal what do you think is
22:22
going to happen to him so G applied for
22:26
political Asylum in May and he's waiting
22:30
to say if it will be
22:36
granted in the meantime he dreams of one
22:39
day settling down again in his own house
22:43
not in a shelter
22:47
mhm and he also wants to be reunited
22:50
with his family right which of course
22:52
the majority of which is still back in
22:54
China
22:56
yeah
22:58
for now he tells his wife that he will
23:00
be able to get a green card
23:03
soon which he says is a
23:09
lie in reality he's not certain what
23:12
will happen to
23:16
him and you know a lot of people like
23:20
him who made a similar Journey he ended
23:23
up going back to China when I talk to
23:25
them they said things are just too
23:29
[Music]
23:31
but go said even if he can make it
23:39
here he will never go back to China as
23:42
long as the Communist party is in
23:46
[Music]
23:50
power age bye-bye
23:56
byebye
23:59
[Music]
Chinas future
24:05
gal would seem Le to be exactly the kind
24:08
of person on paper that China wouldn't
24:12
want to lose somebody who made the
24:14
journey that as you said China is so
24:16
proud of from rural China to Urban China
24:20
who tried to create a business a
24:22
development did so brought his family to
24:25
the big city and yet he'd rather risk
24:29
his life and flee to the United States
24:32
Through the Jungle than endure this
24:35
version of China's government and based
24:37
on your
24:39
reporting hundreds of thousands of
24:41
others are doing the same thing and yet
24:44
the reality is that China is a country
24:48
of huge numbers I mean 1.4 billion
24:52
people right so even if hundreds of
24:55
thousands of Chinese people are leaving
24:57
that's still a pretty small proportion
24:59
of the population so is what we're
25:03
experiencing here what you're
25:04
documenting a threat to China's future
25:07
and something that it's going to be
25:09
taking seriously or is this just the
25:12
cost of the authoritarian political
25:16
model that China now has under shei and
25:20
can it therefore tolerate this
25:24
outflow I don't think any country should
25:27
take this lightly it is a serious
25:32
problem for any government you know in
25:35
the past year I wrote about Chinese
25:39
entrepreneurs young professionals
25:41
intellectuals artists filmmakers all
25:44
kinds of people living because they
25:46
couldn't suffer it anymore there's even
25:49
a term for that called R running away
25:54
from China is among the most popular
25:56
busws in China last year everybody talks
26:01
about where they should move to what
26:03
their options are my friends told me
26:07
that it's also one of the hottest topics
26:09
on dinner tables in China when people
26:12
sit around and really get to talking and
26:14
they get into their cups you're saying
26:16
they talk about fleeing yeah people are
26:19
obsessed with this I think what G and
26:24
many people are doing is starting to
26:29
look like a beginning of a great Exodus
26:33
of China when the government became so
26:37
harsh on its people when the economy is
26:42
not doing well and people can't vote for
26:46
their leaders some people decided
26:49
there's only one way to vote that's with
26:52
their
26:53
[Music]
26:55
feet that was what G and many people did
27:00
and I believe many more people are going
27:02
to do
27:03
[Music]
27:08
that o thank you very much we appreciate
27:12
it thank
27:13
[Music]
27:26
you
27:36
we'll be right
Outro
27:46
back here's what else you need to
27:49
another
27:50
day on Wednesday a rocket fired from
27:53
Lebanon struck a base in Israel killing
27:57
an Israeli soldier and wounding eight
27:59
others and prompting a massive response
28:03
from the Israeli government ours later
