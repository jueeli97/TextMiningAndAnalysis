The Opening Days of Trumpâ€™s First Criminal Trial



0:02
it's the first day of the Trump trial and just walking out the door of my
0:07
house it's a beautiful day 6:11 a.m. thing that keeps running through my
0:14
head is it's kind of amazing that hundreds of jurors are going to show up at the
0:20
Manhattan courthouse and some of them are going to know what they're there for probably talking to their friends their
0:26
relatives about it some of them are going to learn this morning talking to other jurors in line
0:34
asking what all the fuss is about but I really do imagine that there's going to be at least one potential juror who you
0:40
know headphones on get into court here they're going to be there for the first criminal trial of Donald J Trump and
0:47
just I mean how would you
0:54
react from New York Times I'm Michael Bavaro this is the daily
1:00
today what it's been like inside the Lower Manhattan courtroom where political and legal history are being
1:08
made my colleague Jonah bramwit on the opening days of the first criminal trial
1:15
of a US president it's Thursday April
1:21
[Music]
1:27
18th do is that his is M hi there hello
1:32
how are you I'm doing [Music] good okay thank you for coming in Jonah
1:39
in the middle of a trial can you just explain why you're able to even be here sure so we happen to be off on
1:45
Wednesdays during trial so we being not the New York Times but the courts that's right which is why we're taping with you
1:52
and because we now have two full court days of this history-making trial now
1:58
under our belts and the thing about this trial that's so interesting is that there are no cameras in the courtroom
2:04
for The Wider world there's no audio recordings so all we really have is you
2:09
and your eyes and your notebook maybe your laptop and so we're hoping you can
2:15
reconstruct for us the scene of the first two days of this trial and really the highlights yeah I'd be happy to so
2:22
on Monday morning I left the subway it's before 7:00 a.m. the sun is just rising over these grandiose court buildings
2:29
Lower Manhattan I'm about to turn left onto Center Street I'm right in front of the big municipal building and I turn
2:36
onto Center Street that's where the cour houses are I'm crossing and I expected to see a big
2:42
crowd and it was even bigger than I had anticipated oh here we go here we go
2:48
here we go now I finally see the crowd you have camera Banks you have reporters
2:55
you have the beginnings of what will eventually become a protest and you have have this most New York thing which is
3:01
just a big crowd of people who just know something is going on that's right and
3:07
what they know is going on is of course the first trial of an American president
3:12
all right I'm passing the camera folks camera camera camera camera here we go
3:18
let's start with Sharon crley live outside the courthouse in lower man want to get right to ABC's Aaron kki who's outside of the courthouse Robert Costa
3:25
is following it outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan Bob I saw the satellite trucks lined up all in a row
3:30
good morning talk to us how we got here exactly so this is the case that was
3:36
brought by the Manhattan district attorney so prosecutors have accused Donald Trump of covering up the actions
3:42
of his former fixer Michael Cohen after Cohen paid hush money to Stormy Daniels
3:47
stormmy Daniels had a story about having had sex with Donald Trump which Trump has always denied Cohen paid her money
3:54
and then Trump reimbursed Cohen and prosecutors say that Trump essentially
3:59
defrauded the American people because he hid this information that could have been very important for the election
4:06
from those people when he reimbursed Cohen right and as I remember it he also misrepresented what that reimbursement
4:13
was claimed it was a legal fee when in fact it was just reimbursing Michael
4:18
Cohen for a hush money payment exactly yeah he definitely didn't say reimbursement for hush money payment to Stormy Daniels it's a coverup case it's
4:25
a case about hiding information you don't want people to see
4:30
right and of course the context of all this is that it is in the middle of a presidential election it's 2016 Trump
4:35
wants to keep this secret prosecutors allege so that the American public doesn't know about it and potentially
4:42
hold it against him right and prosecutors are telling a story about election interference they're saying that Trump interfered with an election
4:49
and Trump himself is also using the phrase election interference but he's painting the trial itself as election
4:55
interference as he now runs again in 2024 fascinating and because in Manhattan and because the jury pool is
5:02
going to be largely Democratic and the judge is a Democrat and the district attorney is a Democrat Trump keeps
5:08
claiming he cannot get a fair shake this is Democrat Central and in Democrat
5:13
Central Trump doesn't have a chance okay so what happens once you actually enter
5:18
the courthouse outside there's all this Fanfare but inside it's a little bit
5:24
business as usual so I go up to the 15th floor and I walk into the courtroom and
5:30
I sit down and it's the same old courtroom and we're sitting and waiting for the former president around 9:30
5:37
Trump walks in he looks thin he looks a little tired kind of slumping forward as
5:42
if to say with his body like let's get this over with here we go the judge walks in a little bit after that and we
5:50
think we're all set for the trial to start but that's not what happens here and in fact there are a series of legal
5:55
arguments about what the trial is going to look like and what evidence is going to be allowed in so for example
6:02
prosecutors ask that they be allowed to admit into evidence headlines from the national Inquirer that were attacks on
6:10
Trump's 2016 opponents on Ted Cruz on Marco Rubio on Ben Carson why because
6:16
prosecutors are in some sense putting Trump's 2016 campaign on trial these
6:21
headlines are a big part of that because what prosecutors say they show is that Trump had this ongoing deal with the
6:28
national Inquirer and the publish would promote him and it would publish damaging stories about his opponents and
6:33
then crucially it would protect Trump from negative stories and that's exactly what prosecutors say happened with
6:39
Stormy Daniels that the national Inquirer tipped Cohen off about Stormy Daniels trying to sell her story of
6:44
having had sex with Donald Trump which he denies and that led to the hush money payment to her so what prosecutors are
6:50
doing overall with these headlines is establishing a pattern of conduct and that conduct they say was an attempt to
6:57
influence the election in Trump's favor got it and the judge agrees he's going to admit this evidence and this is a
7:03
pretty big win for the prosecution but even though they win that one they're not winning everything they they lose
7:08
some important arguments here one of them was that after the Access Hollywood tape came out there were allegations of
7:15
sexual assault against Donald Trump right and you know this Michael because you reported two of them two of the
7:21
three in question at this very trial prosecutors had hoped to talk about those during trial in front of the jury
7:27
to show the jurors that the Trump campaign was really really focused on
7:34
pushing back against Bad press in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump seemed to describe sexual
7:40
assault that was a big problem for the campaign campaign did everything it could to push back including against
7:45
these allegations that surfaced in the wake of the tape M but the judge saying that the allegations are hearsay that
7:52
they're based on the women's stories says absolutely not that is incredibly prejudicial to the defendant meaning
7:58
Donald Trump would not get a fair trial were those allegations to be mentioned
8:03
and so he will not let those in the jurors will not hear about them so this is a setback of course for the prosecution of victory for Trump's legal
8:10
team it's a setback and it also just shows you how these pre-trial motions shape the context of the trial think of
8:15
the trial is a venue like a theater or athletic contest of some sort and these pre-trial motions are about what gets
8:21
led into the arena and what stays out the sexual assault allegations out the national inquir headlines in okay and
8:28
how is Trump sitting there at the defense table reacting to these
8:34
pre-trial motion rulings from the judge well as I've just said this is very
8:40
important stuff for his trial right hugely important but it's all happening in legal language and I'm decoding it
8:47
for you but if you were sitting there listening to it you might get a little lost and you might get a little bored
8:52
and Trump who is not involved in these arguments seems to fall asleep
9:01
seems to fall asleep you're seeing this with your own eyes what we're seeing overall including our colleague Maggie
9:07
hman who's in the Overflow room and has a direct view of Trump's face I'm sitting behind him in the courtroom so I
9:12
can't see his face that well you guys are double teaming this that's right I'm sitting behind him but Maggie sitting in front of him and what she sees is not
9:18
only that his eyes are closed that wouldn't get you to he is asleep and we have to be really careful about
9:23
reporting that he's asleep even if it seems like a frivolous thing but what happens is that his head is dropping
9:28
down to his chest and then it's snapping back up so you've seen that when a student I've done that
9:35
yeah we all kind of know that feeling of snapping awake suddenly and we see the head motion and it happens several
9:42
times lawyers kind of bothering him not quite shaking him but certainly trying to get his attention and that head
9:48
snapping motion we felt confident enough to report that Trump fell asleep during
9:54
his own criminal trials opening day that's right
10:02
does someone eventually wake him up he wakes up he wakes up and in fact in the afternoon he's much more animated it's
10:09
almost as if he wants to be seen being very much awake right so once these
10:14
pre-trial motions are ruled on and Trump is you know snapped back to attention
10:20
what happens well what happens in the courtroom is that the trial Begins the first trial of an American president is
10:26
now in session and what marks that beginning is jurors walking into the room one by
10:33
one many of them kind of craning their necks over at Donald Trump giggling raising their eyebrows at each other
10:40
filing into the room and being sworn in by the judge and that swearing in marks
10:46
the official beginning of the trial the beginning is jury selection and it's often overlooked it's not dramatized and
10:53
are kind of courtroom dramas in the same way but it's so important it's one of
10:58
the most important parts of the case cuz whoever sits on the jury these are the 12 people who are going to decide
11:05
whether Trump is guilty or whether Trump is innocent so how does jury selection
11:11
actually look and feel and go so jury selection is a winnowing process and in
11:18
order to do that you have to have these people go through a bunch of different
11:23
hurdles mhm so the first hurdle is after the judge describes the case he asks the
11:30
group and there are just short of a hundred of them MH whether they can be fair and impartial and says that if they
11:36
can't they should leave and more than half the group is instantly gone whoa so
11:42
after we do this kind of big Mass excusal we're left with a smaller group
11:47
and so now jurors are getting called in smaller groups to the jury box and what they're going to do there is they're
11:53
going to answer this questionnaire and this part of the process is really conducted by the judge the lawyers are
11:59
involved they're listening but they're not yet asking questions of the jurors themselves MH and what's on the
12:04
questionnaire well it's 42 questions and the questions include their education
12:10
their professional histories their Hobbies what they like to do whether you're a member of huanan or antifa
12:17
you're whether you're far left or far right that's right whether you've read the art of the deal Trump's book which
12:22
some perspective jurors have why it was a bestseller in its time that's right and some of it can be answered in yes no
12:28
question but some of it can be answered more at length so some of the perspective jurors are going very very fast yes no no no
12:36
yes right CU this is an oral questionnaire that's right but some of them are taking their time they're expanding on their Hobbies so the
12:43
potential juror in seat three for example is talking about her hobbies and she says some you know running hiking
12:49
and then she said I'd like to go to the club and it got a huge laugh and you get that kind of thing uh in jury selection
12:56
which is one of the reasons it's so fun it's the height of normality in the situation that is anything but normal
13:02
right the most banale answer possible delivered in front of the former president and current Republican nominee
13:09
for president well that's one of the fascinating Parts about all this right is that they're answering in front of
13:14
trump and they're answering questions about Trump in front of trump he doesn't react all that much but whenever someone
13:21
says they've read the art of the deal and there are a few of those he kind of nods appreciatively Smiles he likes that
13:27
it's very clear right but because there are so many questions this is taking
13:33
forever especially when people are choosing to answer and elaborate and digress this is when you fall asleep
13:39
this is when I would have fallen asleep if I were a normal person and by the end of the day where does jury selection
13:46
stand well the questionnaire is another device for shrinking that jury pool and so the questionnaire has almost these
13:53
little obstacles or roadblocks including in fact a question that jurors have seen before whether they would have any
13:59
problem being fair and impartial and they asked it again they're asked it again and they're asked it in this more individualized way the judge is
14:05
questioning them they're responding so remember that woman who said she liked to go to the club got a big laugh she
14:11
reaches question 34 and question 34 reads do you have any strong opinions or firmly held beliefs about former
14:17
president Donald Trump or the fact that he is a current candidate for president that would interfere with your ability to be a fair and impartial juror she
14:24
said yes she does have an opinion that would prevent her from being fair and impartial and and she too is excused H
14:31
so that's how it works people answer the question there and they get excused in that way or they have a scheduling
14:37
conflict once they reach the jury box and so to answer your question Michael
14:42
at the end of day one given all these problems with the questionnaire and the length of time it's taken to respond to
14:48
and people getting dismissed based on their answers there is not a single jur seated for this
14:56
[Music] trial and it's starting to look like this is going to be a really hard case
15:03
for which to find an impartial jury that's the feeling in the room
15:09
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
15:19
yeah we'll be right
15:25
back so J let's turn to day two what does jury selection look like on Tuesday
15:32
so when the day begins it looks almost exactly like it looked when the day ended on Monday we're still with the
15:39
questionnaire getting some interesting answers but even though it feels like we're going slow we are going and so
15:46
we've gone from about a 100 people to now there's about 24 in the room there's
15:51
18 in the juror box and by the time we hit lunch all those people have answered all those questions and we are ready for
15:57
the next step in the process which is V and what it is is the heart of jury
16:05
selection this is the point where the lawyers themselves finally get to interview the jurors and we get so much
16:10
information from this moment because the lawyers ask questions based on what they want out of the jurors so the
16:16
prosecution is asking all these different kinds of questions the first round of wer is done by a guy named
16:22
Joshua Stein glass very experienced trial lawyer with the Manhattan District Attorney's office and he's providing all
16:27
these hypotheticals I'll give you one example cuz I found this one really really interesting he
16:33
provides a hypothetical about a man who wants his wife killed and essentially
16:38
hires a Hitman to do it and what he asked the jurors is if that case were before you would you be able to see that
16:45
the man who hired the Hitman was a part of this crime and of course what he's really getting at is
16:51
can you accept that even though Michael Cohen Trump's fixer made this payment
16:57
Trump is the guy who hired him to do it that's right if there are other people
17:02
involved will jurors still be able to see Donald Trump's hands behind it all fascinating and what were some of the
17:08
responses people mostly said yes we accept that so that's how the prosecution did
17:15
it but the defense had a totally different method of wader they were very focused on their
17:22
client and people's opinions about their client so what kind of questions do we get from them so the lawyer Todd blanch is asking people what do you make of
17:28
president president Trump what do you think of President Trump and what are some of the responses to that well there is this incredible exchange with one of
17:34
the jurors who absolutely refuses to give his opinion of Donald Trump they go
17:39
back and forth and back and forth and the juror keeps insisting you don't need to know my opinion of him all you need
17:44
to know is that I'm going to be fair and impartial like I said and blanch pushes and the guy pushes back and the only way
17:52
the guy budges is he finally kind of confesses almost at the end that yes I am a Democrat and that's all we get and
17:59
what ends up happening to this potential juror believe it or not he got dismissed I can believe
18:05
it and of course it's worth saying that this guy and everybody else is being asked that question just feet from Trump
18:13
himself that's right and you might think you were going to get a really kind of spicy like popcorn emoji type exchange
18:20
from that but because these are now jurors who have said they can be fair and impartial who to some extent want to
18:26
be on this jury or at least wouldn't mind being on this jury they're being very restrained mostly what they are
18:32
emphasizing much like that guy I just described did is that they can be fair they can be impartial there's one woman
18:39
who gives this really remarkable answer she says you know I thought about this last night I stayed up all night I
18:45
couldn't sleep thinking about whether I could be fair it's really important to me and I can what ends up happening to
18:52
that particular J she's also dismissed H and she's dismissed without any reason
18:57
at all the defense besides it doesn't like her doesn't want her on the jury and they have a certain number of
19:03
chances to just get rid of jurors no questions asked other jurors are getting dismissed for cause I'm doing air quotes
19:09
with my hands which means that the lawyers have argued they actually revealed themselves through their
19:14
answers or through old social media posts which are brought up in the courtroom to be either non-credible
19:21
meaning they've said they can be fair and they can't or somehow too biased to be on the jury H wait can I just dial into that for a second are lawyers
19:28
researching the jurors in real time going online and saying I'm I'm making this up but Jonah bramwit uh is a
19:35
potential juror and I'm going to go off into my little corner of the courtroom and Google everything you've ever said
19:40
is that what's happening in the room yeah there's a whole profession dedicated to that it's called jury consultant and they're very good at
19:45
finding information on people in a hurry and it certainly looked as if they were in play did a social media post end up
19:51
getting anybody kicked off this jury yes there were posts from kind of 2016 era
19:58
internet you'll remember that time as a very heated one on the internet Facebook memes are a big thing and so there's all
20:04
kinds of lock him up type memes and rhetoric and some of the potential jurors here have used those and those
20:12
jurors are dismissed for a reason fasinating so we have these two types of dismissals right we have these
20:17
peremptory dismissals no reason at all given and we have four cause dismissals and the process is called jury selection
20:25
but you don't actually get selected for a jury the thing is to make it through all these obstacles you're kind of
20:30
you're left over right and so when certain jurors are not dismissed and they've made it through all these stages
20:37
by the end of the day we've gone from zero jurors seated to seven jurors who will be participating in Donald Trump's
20:44
trial got it and without going through all seven just give us a little bit of a sketch of who so far is on this jury
20:51
what stands out well not that much stands out so we've got four men we've got three women you know one lives on
20:57
the Upper East Side one lives in Chelsea obviously they're from all over Manhattan they have these kind of very
21:03
normal Hobbies like spending time with family and friends they have somewhat Anonymous jobs we've got two lawyers
21:09
we've got someone who's worked in sales so there's not that much identifying information and that's not an accident
21:16
one of the things that often happens with jury selection whether it be for Donald Trump or for anyone else is the most interesting jurors the jurors that
21:23
kind of catch your attention during the process they get picked off because they are being so interested
21:29
that they interest one or the other side in a negative way and soon they're excused so most of the jurors who are
21:35
actually seated are not memorable are not that memorable save one particular
21:40
jur okay all right I'll bite what do I need to know about that one particular jur so let me tell you about a prospective juror who we knew as 374 who
21:48
will now be juror number five she's a middle school teacher from Harlem and she said that she has friends who have
21:54
really strong opinions about Trump but she herself does not and she insisted several times I am not a political
22:01
person and then she said this thing that made me quite surprised that the prosecution was fine with having her on
22:07
the jury she said quote president Trump speaks his mind and I'd rather that than someone who's in office who you don't
22:13
know what they're thinking H so she expressed approval of President Trump
22:18
yeah it was mild approval but the thing is especially for the defense in this trial all you need is one juror one
22:26
juror can tie up deliberation in knots and you can end with a hung jury and
22:32
this is actually something that I saw firsthand in 2019 I was a four person on a jury how do you like that yeah and the
22:38
trial was really complicated but I had thought while we were doing the trial oh this is going to be a really easy
22:45
decision I thought the defendant in that case was guilty so we get into deliberations but there's this one juror
22:51
who keeps gumming up the works every time we seem to be making progress getting a conversation started this
22:57
juror proverbially throws up his hands and says I am not convicting this man is innocent and we talked and we talked and
23:04
as the four person I was trying to use all my skills to mediate but anytime we made any progress this guy would blow it
23:11
up and long story short hung jury big victory for the defense lawyer and we
23:17
come out of the room and she points at this juror the guy the defense lawyer the defense lawyer points at this juror
23:22
who blew everything up and she said I knew it I knew I had my guy okay I don't want to read too much into you said
23:28
about that one juror but should I read between the lines to think that if there's a hung jury you wonder if it
23:35
might be that juror that's what everyone in the courtroom is wondering not just about this juror but about every single
23:41
person who was selected is this the person who swings the case for me is this the person who swings the case
23:47
against me these juries are so complex it's 12 people who don't know each other
23:52
at the start of the trial and by the end of the trial have seen each other every morning and are experiencing the same
23:57
things but are not allowed to have talked about the case until deliberations start in that moment when
24:03
deliberations start you're going to learn a whole lot about each other that's right there's this alchemical moment where suddenly it all matters
24:10
every personality selected matters and that's why jury selection is so important and that's why these last two
24:16
days are actually one of the most important parts of this trial okay so by my math this trial will require five
24:22
more jurors to get to 12 I know also they're going to need to be alternates but from what you're saying what looked
24:28
like a really uphill battle to get an impartial jury or a jury that said it
24:36
could be impartial and Trump was very doubtful one could be found has turned
24:41
out to not be so hard to find that's right and in fact we went from thinking oh boy this is going awfully slowly to
24:48
the judge himself saying we could be doing opening arguments as soon as Monday morning and I think that
24:55
highlights something that's really fascinating both about this trial and about the jury selection process overall
25:01
one of the things that lawyers have been arguing about is whether or not it's important to figure out what juror's
25:08
opinions about Donald Trump are and the prosecution and I think the Judge have really said no that's not the key issue
25:14
here the key issue is not whether or not people have opinions about Donald Trump right who doesn't have an opinion about Donald Trump exactly they're going to
25:21
automatically they're going to the question is whether or not they can be fair and impartial and the seven people
25:27
we already have SE and presumably the five people that we're going to get over the next few
25:32
days and however many alternates we expect six are all going to have answered that question not I hate Trump
25:39
I love Trump but I can weigh in on the former president's innocence or guilt and I can do it as fairly as humanly
25:45
possible now Trump is not happy about this that he said after court yesterday
25:50
quote we have a highly conflicted judge and he's rushing this trial and I think that he is going to see these beats of
25:56
the system the criminal justice system as it works on him as he is experiencing it as unfair that is typically how he
26:04
talks about it and how he views it but what he's getting is what defendants get
26:09
this is the system in New York in the United States this is its answer to how do you pick a fair jury well you ask
26:16
people can you be fair and you put them through this process and the outcome is 12 people and so I think we're going to
26:23
see this over and over again in this trial we're going to see Trump experience the criminal justice system
26:29
and its routines yeah openings Witnesses evidence closings he's going to go
26:34
through all of it and I think at every turn it makes sense to expect him to say well this is not fair well the judge is
26:41
doing something wrong while the prosecutors are doing something wrong while the jury is doing something wrong but at the end of the day he's going to
26:48
be a defendant and he's going to sit mostly silently if his lawyers can make
26:54
him do that and watch this process play itself out so the system is going to try and treat
27:00
him like any other defendant even though of course he's not he's not and he is
27:06
going to fight back like no other defendant would like no other defendant could and that tension him pushing
27:13
against the criminal justice system as it strives to treat him as it would anyone else is going to be a defining
27:20

back here's what else you need to another day it's clear the Israelis are
28:02
making a decision to act we hope they do so in a way that does as little to escalate this as possible and in a way
28:09
that as I said during a visit to Jerusalem on Wednesday Britain's foreign secretary left little doubt that Israel
28:15
would retaliate against Iran for last weekend's aerial attack despite pressure
28:21
from the United States and Britain to stand down the question now is what form
28:27
that retaliation will take the times reports that Israel is weighing several
28:33
options including a direct strike on Iran a Cyber attack or targeted
28:41
assassinations and look history judges us for what we do this is a critical time right now critical time in the
28:47
world stage in a plan that could threaten his job Republican house Speaker Mike Johnson will put a series
28:54
of foreign aid bills up for a vote this weekend the bills especially for Aid to
29:00
Ukraine are strongly opposed by farri House Republicans at least two of whom
29:07
have threatened to try to OU Johnson over the plan you know I can make a
29:12
selfish decision and and and do something that that's different but I I'm doing here what I believe to be the
29:18
right thing um I think providing lethal Aid to Ukraine right now is critically important I really do I really do
