How Tesla Planted the Seeds for Its Own Potential Downfall


0:01
from The New York Times I'm cine benold this is the
0:06
[Music] daily today the story of how China gave
0:14
Tesla a Lifeline that saved the company and how that Lifeline has now given
0:20
China the tools to beat Tesla at its own game my colleague Mara vist andol
0:28
explains
0:35
it's Tuesday April [Music]
0:43
9th so maray you've spent the past four months investigating Elon Musk and his
0:49
ties to China through his company Tesla tell us why well a lot of American companies are heavily invested in China
0:57
but Tesla's kind of special you know as my my colleagues and I started talking to sources we realized that many people
1:06
felt that China played a crucial role in rescuing the company at a critical
1:13
moment when it was on the brink of failure and that China helps account for
1:18
Tesla's success for making it the most valuable car company in the world today
1:24
and for making Elon Musk Ultra Rich that's super intriguing so maybe take us
1:30
back to the beginning when does this story start so the story starts in the
1:36
mid-2010s Tesla had been this company that had all this hype around it but a
1:42
lot of people were shocked by Tesla's earnings report not only did they make a lot less money than expected they're
1:48
also making a lot less cars Tesla was struggling the delivery of the model 3
1:54
has been delayed yet again Tesla Engineers are saying 40% of the parts
1:59
made at the font Factory need reworking at the time they made their cars in
2:04
Fremont California and they were facing production delays Tesla is confirming
2:10
that kosha is investigating the company over concerns over workplace safety Ela
2:15
musk has instituted a kind of famously grueling work culture at the factory and
2:22
that did not go over well with California labor law the federal government now has four active
2:28
investigations involved Tesla they were clashing with Regulators say the
2:33
national Transportation safety board will investigate a second crash involving Tesla's autopilot system
2:39
billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk friends are really concerned about him that's what musk told the New York Times
2:45
and by 2018 I mean he was having all of these crises according to the times musk
2:50
choked up multiple times and struggled to maintain his composure during an hour-long interview about turmoil at his
2:57
electric car company Tesla so all of this kind of converged to put immense pressure on him
3:04
to do something and where does China come in
3:11
well setting up a factory in China in a way would solve some of these problems for musk you know labor costs were lower
3:19
workers couldn't unionize there China provided access to this steady supply of
3:24
Cheaper parts so Elon Musk was set on going to China but first Tesla and musk
3:32
wanted to change a key policy in China hm what kind of policy so they wanted
3:38
China to adopt a policy that was aimed at lowering car emissions and the idea
3:45
was that it would be modeled after a similar policy in California that had
3:50
benefited Tesla there okay so explain what that policy actually did and how
3:55
did it benefit Tesla so California had this system called the zero emission vehicle program and that was designed to
4:03
encourage companies to make cleaner cars including electric vehicles and they did
4:10
that by setting pollution targets so companies that made a lot of clean cars
4:18
got credits and then companies that failed to meet those targets that produce too many gas guzzling cars would
4:26
have to buy credits from the cleaner company companies so California is trying to incentivize companies to make
4:33
cleaner cars by forcing the traditional car makers to pay cleaner car makers
4:39
which basically means dirtier car makers are effectively subsidizing cleaner cars yes that's right and Tesla as a company
4:47
that came along just making EVS profited immensely from this system and in its
4:54
early years when Tesla was really struggling to stay a
5:00
the money that it earned from selling credits in California to polluting car companies were absolutely crucial I mean
5:07
so much so that the company structured a lot of its lobbying efforts around this system around preserving these credits
5:14
and we talked to a former regulator who said as much how much money are we
5:20
talking about here so from 2008 when Tesla unveiled its first car up until
5:25
the end of last year Tesla made almost $4
5:30
billion by selling credits in California wow so musk basically wants China to
5:36
recreate this California style program which was incredibly lucrative for Tesla
5:43
there and they're basically holding that up as a condition to their building a factory in China right and you know at
5:50
this point in the story an interesting Alliance emerges because it wasn't just Tesla that wanted this emissions program
5:56
in China it was also environmentalist from California who had seen the success
6:02
of the program up close in their own State h i mean if you go back to that
6:07
period to the early 2010s I was living in China at the time in Beijing and
6:13
Shanghai and it was incredibly polluted we called it air Apocalypse at times you
6:19
know I had my first child in China at that point and as soon as it was safe to
6:25
put like a baby mask on her we we put a little baby mask on her and we you know there days where people just would try
6:31
to avoid going outside because it was so polluted and some of the pollution was actually wafting across the Pacific
6:38
Ocean to California wow so California is experiencing that Chinese air pollution
6:45
firsthand and in a way has a direct stake in lowering it that's right so Governor Jerry Brown
6:53
for example this became kind of his signature issue was working with China to clean up the environment part by
7:00
exporting this submission scheme you know it was also an era of a lot more us China cooperation China was seen as
7:08
absolutely crucial to combating climate change so you had all these groups
7:14
working to get this California emission scheme exported to China and the
7:19
governor's office and environmental groups and Tesla and it worked in 2017
7:27
China did adopt a system that was modeled after California's it's pretty incredible so
7:34
California basically exports its emissions trading system to China which
7:40
I imagine at the time was a big win for Californian environmentalists but it was also a big win for Tesla it was
7:46
definitely a big win for Tesla and we know that in just a few years Tesla made
7:52
almost $1 billion from the emissions trading Program help Lobby for in
7:58
China so Elon Musk goes on builds a factory in
8:04
China and he does so in Shanghai where he builds a close
8:10
relationship with the top official in the city who actually is now the number
8:17
two official in all of China leang wow so according to Chinese State media Elon
8:22
Musk actually proposed building the factory in two years which would be
8:27
fast and Lee came back and proposed that they do it in one year which you know
8:33
things go up really quickly in China but even for China this is incredibly fast
8:38
and they broke ground on the factory in January 2019 and by the end of the year
8:45
cars were rolling off the line so then in January 2020 musk was able to get up
8:52
on stage in shangai and unveil the first Chinese made Teslas really want to thank you know the
9:00
Tesla team and and the government officials that have been really helpful in making this happen next to him on
9:06
stage is Tesla's top lobbyist who helped push through some of these changes thank
9:12
yeah everybody can tell I mean elan's super super happy
9:19
today and she says music please cue the [Applause]
9:25
music and he he actually like broke into dance he was so happy kind of awkward
9:32
[Applause] dance and what is the factory like the
9:37
Shanghai Factory is huge 20,000 people work there Tesla's factories around the
9:44
world tend to be pretty large but the Shanghai workers work more shifts and when Tesla set up in China
9:51
Chinese Banks ended up offering Tesla $1.5 billion in low interest loans they
9:57
got a preferential tax rate in Shanghai you know this deal was so generous that one Auto industry official
10:06
we talked to said that a government Minister had actually lamented that they
10:11
were giving Tesla too much and it is an incredibly productive Factory it's now
10:18
the flagship export Factory for Tesla so it opens in late
10:25
2019 and that's of course the time when the pandemic hits yes I mean you might
10:30
think that this is really poor timing for Elon Musk but it didn't quite turn
10:35
out that way in fact Tesla's Factory in Shanghai was closed for only around 2
10:42
weeks whereas the factory in Fremont was closed for around two months that's a
10:49
big difference yes and it really really mattered to Elon Musk if you can think back to 2020 you might recall that he
10:57
was railing against California politicians for closing his Factory in
11:02
China the factory stayed open workers were working around the clock and Elon Musk said on a podcast um China rocks in
11:09
my opinion China rocks there's like a lot of smart hardworking people and they really they're not entitled they're not
11:16
complacent whereas [Music]
11:22
I we've seen a lot of momentum and enthusiasm for electric vehicles stocks
11:27
and Tesla certainly leading the Tesla's stock price kept going up Tesla
11:32
has become just the fifth company to reach a trillion doll valuation the massive valuation happened after Tesla's
11:38
stock price hit an all-time high of more than $1,000 so this company that had just a
11:45
few years earlier been on the brink of failure looking to China for a Lifeline
11:50
was suddenly Riding High and chesla is now the most valuable car company in the
11:56
world it's worth more than General Motors Ford Fiat crisis by the summer it had become the most valuable car company
12:03
in the world guess what Elon Musk is now the world's richest fan forb says he's
12:08
worth more than $255 billion and Elon musk's wealth is tied
12:15
up in Tesla stock and in the following year he became the wealthiest man in the [Music]
12:23
world so you have this emission trading system which we discussed and which you
12:29
know in part thanks to Tesla is now established in China it's bringing in money to Tesla and now this Shanghai
12:36
Factory is continuing to produce cars for the Tesla in the middle of the pandemic so China really paid off for
12:43
Tesla but what was in it for China well
12:48
China wasn't doing this for charity what Chinese leaders really
12:54
wanted was to turn their fledgling electric vehicle industry into a global
13:01
Powerhouse and they figured that Tesla was the ticket to get there and that's
13:09
precisely what
13:18
happened we'll be right back so Mara you've just told us the
13:26
story of how Elon Musk used China to turn Tesla into the biggest carmaker in the world and himself at one point into
13:33
the richest man in the world now I want to understand the other side of the story how did China use
13:41
Tesla well Tesla basically became a catfish for China's EV industry a
13:48
catfish what do you mean by that it's a term from the business world and you know essentially it means a super
13:55
aggressive fish that makes the other fish in the pond swim faster H and by
14:01
bringing in this super competitive aggressive foreign company into China
14:09
which at that point had these fledgling EV companies Chinese leaders hoped to
14:16
Spur the upstart Chinese EV makers to kind of up their game so you're saying
14:23
that at this point china actually already had a number of smaller EV companies which you know many people in
14:30
the west may not even been aware of like these smaller fish in the pond that you were referring
14:35
to yes there were a lot of them they were often kind of locally based like
14:41
one would be strong in one city and one would be strong in another city and Chinese leaders saw that they needed to
14:48
become more competitive in order to thrive and you know China had tried for
14:53
decades to build up this traditional car industry by bringing in foreign
14:59
companies to set up joint ventures you know they had really had their sight set
15:04
on building a strong car industry and it didn't really work I mean how many
15:09
Chinese traditional Chinese car company brands can you name exactly none yeah
15:15
right so you know going back to the As and the 2010s they had this advantage that many
15:24
Chinese hadn't yet been hooked on gas guzzling cars mhm they was still many
15:29
people who were buying their first car ever so officials had all these levers
15:35
they could pull to try to encourage or try to push people's behavior in a certain direction and their idea was to
15:43
try to ensure that when people went to buy their first car it would be an EV
15:50
and not just an EV but hopefully a chines EV so you know they did things like at the time just a license plate
15:57
for your car could cost in exorbitant amount of money and be difficult to get and so they made
16:03
license plates for electric vehicles free so there were all these kind of preferential policies that were unveiled
16:09
to kind of nudge people toward buying EVS so that's fascinating so China is
16:17
incentivizing consumers to buy EV cars
16:22
and incentivizing also the whole industry to kind of get its act together
16:27
by you know chucking this big American company in the mix and hoping that it will increase
16:33
competitiveness what I'm particularly struck by Mara in what you said is the sort of concept of Lea frogging over the
16:41
conventional combustion engine phase which you know took us decades to live through we're still living in it in many
16:47
ways in the west but listening to you it sounds a little bit like China wasn't really thinking about this transition to
16:53
EVS as an environmental policy it sounds like they were doing this more from an industrial policy
16:59
perspective right the environment and the horrible era at the time was a factor but it was a pretty minor Factor
17:07
according to people who were privy to the policy discussions the more significant factor was industrial policy
17:14
and an interest in building up a competitive sphere so China now wants to become a
17:20
leader in the global EV sector and it wants to use Tesla to get there what
17:27
does that actually look like well you need sophisticated suppliers to make the
17:32
component parts of an of electric vehicles and just by being in China Tesla helped spur the development of
17:41
several suppliers like for example the battery is a crucial piece of any EV MH
17:48
and Tesla with a fair amount of encouragement and also various levers
17:55
from the Chinese government became a customer of a battery maker called catl
18:01
a homegrown Chinese battery maker and they have become very close to Tesla and
18:07
have even set up a factory near Tesla's in Shanghai and today with Tesla's
18:13
business and of course with the business of some other companies catl is the biggest battery maker in the world wow
18:21
but beyond just stimulating the growth of suppliers Tesla also you know made
18:27
these other fish in the Pond swim faster and the biggest Chinese EV company to
18:33
come out of that period is one called byd short for build your
18:39
dreams we a byd you've probably never heard of us from Battery maker to the
18:45
biggest electric vehicle or EV manufacturer in China they've got a lot of models they've got a lot of discounts
18:51
they've got a lot of market growth China's biggest EV maker just overtook Tesla in terms of worldwide sales be
18:59
10 Chinese automobile redefined I've actually started seeing
19:06
that brand on the streets here in Europe recently especially in Germany where you know my brother actually used to lease a
19:12
Tesla and now Lees a byd does he like it
19:17
he does although he did to be fair say that he misses the sort of luxury of the Tesla um but it just became too
19:26
expensive really the price point is a huge reason that byd is increasingly
19:31
giving Tesla a run for its money you know years ago back in 2011 although
19:38
there's competitors now ramping up and as you're familiar with byd which is also on Elon Musk actually mocked their
19:44
cars is trying to compete why do you laugh he asked an interviewer have you
19:50
seen their car I have seen their car have you seen their cars you know sort of suggesting like they're no
19:57
competition for us you don't see them at all as a competitor no why is that I mean they offer a lower price
20:03
point I don't I don't think they have a great product I I think they their focus is and rightly should be on making sure
20:10
they don't die in China but they have been steadily improving you know they've been in the EV space for a while but
20:17
they really started improving a few years ago once Tesla came on the scene
20:23
you know that was due to a number of factors not entirely because of Tesla but
20:29
Tesla played a role in helping train up talent in China One former Tesla
20:35
employee who worked at the company as they were getting set up in China told me that most of the employees who were
20:42
at the company at the time now work for Chinese competitors wow you know so they they have really played this important
20:49
role in the EV ecosystem and you mentioned the price uh kind of Advantage so just for comparison
20:56
like what does an average byd sell for compared to like a more affordable Tesla
21:02
car so byd has an ultra cheap model called The Seagull that sells for around
21:10
$10,000 now in China whereas Tesla Model 3s and model y's in China sell for more
21:17
than twice that wow how is byd able to sell EVS at these much lower
21:25
prices well the seagull is really just a simpler car it has less range than a Tesla it lacks
21:31
some safety measures but B has this other crucial Advantage which is that
21:37
they're vertically integrated like they control many aspects of the supply chain
21:43
up and down the supply chain when you look at the battery level they make batteries but they even own the mines
21:52
where lithium is mined for the batteries wow and they recently launched a fleet of ships so actually operate the boats
22:00
that are sending their cars to Europe or other parts of the world so byd is
22:06
basically cutting out the middleman on all these aspects of the supply chain and that's how they can undercut other
22:13
car makers on price yeah they've cut out the middleman and they've cut out the shipping company and you know almost
22:18
everything else so how is byd doing now as a company compared to
22:25
Tesla in terms of market cap there still much smaller than Tesla but crucially
22:31
they overtook Tesla in sales in the last quarter of last year wow yeah there was
22:36
a huge milestone Tesla still dominates in the European market which is a very
22:42
important market for EVS U but byd is starting to export there and you know
22:49
Europe is traditionally is kind of Automotive Powerhouse and the companies and
22:56
government officials there are very very concerned I interviewed the French Finance Minister and he told me that
23:03
China has a 5 to 7year head start on Europe when it comes to Eves wow and
23:09
what has Elon Musk said about this incredible rise of byd in recent years do you do you think he anticipated that
23:16
Tesla's entry into the Chinese market could end up building up its own
23:22
competition well I can't get inside his head and he did not respond to our questions but but chines car companies
23:29
are the most competitive car companies in the world he has certainly changed his tune you know so you know remember
23:35
he was joking about byd some years ago yes um yeah he's he's not joking anymore
23:42
right I think they will have significant success you know he had dismissed Chinese EV makers he now appears
23:50
increasingly concerned about these new competitors Frank I think if if if they're not trade barriers established
23:57
they they will pretty much demolish but most other call companies in the world to the point that on an earnings
24:03
call in January he all but endorsed the use of trade
24:09
barriers against them they're extremely good I think it's so interesting in in a
24:14
way of course with perfect hindsight the kind of maybe complacency or naivity with which he may not have
24:21
intiated this turn of events and in some ways he's not alone right it speaks of something larger like China for a long
24:27
time was seen as kind of the sweat shop or the manufacturer of the world or perhaps as a an export market for a lot
24:34
of these Western companies it certainly wasn't putting out its own big brand names it was making stuff for the brand
24:41
names but recently they have quite a lot of their own brand names I mean you know everybody talks about Tik top there's
24:46
Huawei there is WeChat Lenovo and now there is byd so China is becoming a
24:54
leader in technology in certain areas and I think that shift in some ways has
25:00
happened and a lot of Western companies perhaps like Tesla were kind of late to
25:06
waking up to that right Tesla is looking
25:12
fragile now there stock price dropped 30% in the first quarter of this year
25:18
and to a large degree that is because of the threat of companies like buid from
25:25
China and you know the perception that Tesla's position as number one in the
25:34
market is no longer guaranteed so Mara all this raises a
25:39
much bigger question for me which is who is going to own the future of
25:45
EVs and based on everything you've said so far it seems like China owns the future of EVS is that right well
25:53
possibly but the jury is still out mhm Tesla's still far bigger for
25:59
now but there is this increasing fear that China owns the future of EVS you
26:06
know if you look at the us there are already 25% tariffs on EVS from China
26:15
there's talk of increasing them the Commerce Department recently launched an
26:20
investigation into data collection by electric vehicles from China you know so
26:25
all of these factors are creating uncertainty around you know what could happen and the European Union may also
26:33
add new tariffs against Chinese mid cars mhm and China is an economic rival and a
26:40
security rival and you know in many ways our main adversary so this whole issue
26:48
is intertwined with National Security and Tesla's really in the middle of
26:54
it right so the sort of new cold war that people are talking about between
26:59
the US and China is in a sense the backdrop to the story but you know on
27:05
one level what we've been talking about is it's really a corporate story right an economic story that has this
27:11
geopolitical backdrop but it's also very much an environmental story so
27:17
regardless of how Elon Musk and Tesla fa in the end is BD's rise and its ability
27:24
to create high quality and perhaps more importantly affordable EVS ultimately a good thing for the world
27:31
you know if I think back on those years I spent living in Shanghai and Beijing when it was extremely polluted and there
27:38
were days when you couldn't go outside I don't think anyone wants to go back to
27:45
that so it's clear that EES are the future and that they're crucial to the
27:52
green energy transition that we have to make how exactly we get there is still
27:58
clear but what is true is that China did just make that transition
28:07
easier Mara thank you so much thank you [Music]
28:20
krine we'll be right
28:26
back here's what else you you need to know today oh my
28:31
God millions of people across North America were waiting for their turn to
28:37
experience a rare event on Monday from [Music]
28:46
Mexico to Texas awesome just awesome we can see the corona really well oh you
28:53
can Illinois oh and we are Falling Into Darkness right now what an incredible
28:59
sensation and you are hearing and seeing the crowd of 15,000 gathered here at sou
29:05
including daily producers in New York like the sky is almost like a deep blue
29:10
under the clouds oh my God the sun is disappearing and it's gone oh
29:18
who all the way up to Canada that's what I'm talking
29:26
about the moon lighted in front of the Sun and obscured it entirely in a total
29:32
solar eclipse momentarily plunging the day Into Darkness super exciting it's so
29:37
amazing to see science in action like [Music]
