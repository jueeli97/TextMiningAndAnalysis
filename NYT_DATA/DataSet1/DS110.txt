Why Boeingâ€™s Top Airplanes Keep Failing



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
Tavern and this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:10
daily questions have swirled for weeks
0:13
over what went wrong on an Alaska
0:15
Airlines flight where a piece of the
0:17
plane blew out into the sky terrifying
0:20
passengers and renewing concerns about
0:22
the plane's manufacturer
0:25
Boeing last week in Washington we
0:27
started to get some answers today my
0:31
colleague Sydney Ember

0:54
12th Sydney welcome to the show hi hi so
Background
0:59
Sydney last month there was this
1:01
terrifying incident on an Alaska
1:03
Airlines flight a door fell off the
1:06
plane while it was in midair and since
1:08
then there's been this kind of laundry
1:10
list of unanswered questions about what
1:12
went wrong and ultimately you know who
1:15
was responsible for that and so last
1:17
week we started to get some of our first
1:19
clear answers but let's start with the
1:21
accident itself walk us through what
1:23
happened so Boeing has been under the
1:25
microscope for about 5 years after two
1:28
crashes in 2018 and early 2019 killed
1:33
nearly 350 people and these planes which
1:35
are Boeing 737 Max eight planes
1:39
important plane for Boeing and for
1:41
airlines in the United States right
1:43
extremely important this had become one
1:45
of boeings bestselling planes you know
1:48
it was flying all around the world and
1:51
these crashes cost Boeing billions of
1:53
dollars and it vowed to make the max 8s
1:57
much much safer but then this incident
2:00
in January happens this time with a Max
Takeoff
2:06
[Music]
2:08
9 on January 5th Alaska Airlines flight
2:11
1282 takes off from Portland
2:13
International Airport heading to Ontario
2:16
California and about 10 minutes after
2:18
takeoff at about 16,000 ft you just hear
2:21
a big boom there's a loud bang it was
2:24
silent for like 1 second and then you
2:26
would just feel and hear a lot of air
2:28
going around freezing for
2:30
air the plane rattles the oxygen masks
2:34
drop lights flicker so at first I
2:37
thought it was just the window and then
2:39
I realized it was the whole panel
2:40
passengers start realizing there's a
2:42
giant hole now in the
2:45
plane me the nature of the emergency and
2:48
your intentions Seattle alas 122 we just
2:51
press we declar emergency we need a
2:54
defend God that is terrifying yeah this
2:57
is a really really scary moment for a
3:00
lot of passengers I think a lot of them
3:02
are thinking the
3:06
worst and please your SE with your SE
3:09
secely until you are told to stand up
3:12
thank
3:13
you the pilots eventually make an
3:16
emergency landing back in
Landing
3:22
Portland and what had happened was a
3:25
panel called a door plug that panel had
3:28
fallen off the pl essentially there are
3:31
no serious injuries but it could have
3:34
been catastrophic if this had happened
3:36
at cruising altitude roughly 30,000 ft
3:39
or or higher up especially if passengers
3:42
hadn't been wearing their seat belts or
3:44
if people had been moving around as they
3:46
often are when planes get up to cruising
3:48
altitude MH so really kind of miraculous
3:51
that no one was actually hurt I mean
3:53
they were pretty close to getting into a
3:55
Zone where there could have been some
3:56
pretty serious injuries so what's the
3:58
reaction to this I mean aside from the
4:01
obvious Terror of the
4:02
passengers well the question immediately
4:04
is who is to blame is it Alaska Airlines
4:08
is it Boeing is it Spirit AOS systems
4:11
which built the body of the plane and
4:12
then shipped it to Boeing's Factory and
4:14
rent in Washington is it the FAA and
4:17
federal Regulators no one really knows
4:19
in the immediate aftermath and as these
4:21
questions are swirling what happens
4:22
almost immediately is the Federal
4:24
Aviation Administration the main
4:26
regulator for Airlines grounds Max 9
4:29
planes with this door plug so it amounts
4:31
to about 170 max9 planes in this country
4:35
got it and that seems like a lot right
4:38
yeah I mean the two airlines in the
4:41
United States that fly Max 9's at this
4:43
point are just Alaska and United
4:46
Airlines but these are you know sizable
4:49
portions of their Fleet Alaska has 65
4:52
Max 9es and United has 79 the most of
4:56
any us carrier at this point so this
4:58
snarls their schedule pilots and flight
5:00
attendants can't get to their next
5:03
destination they can't get home because
5:05
the planes that they were supposed to
5:06
fly on have been grounded so it's a
5:09
sizable number of planes that are doing
5:11
a lot of work and this becomes a big
5:13
problem for those Airlines and what do
5:16
the airlines themselves say I mean
5:18
specifically Alaska Airlines perhaps you
5:20
know these are Boeing's customers right
5:23
how do they respond to this Well Airline
5:26
CEOs come out pretty forcefully blaming
5:28
Boeing I'm more than frustrated and
5:30
disappointed the Alaska Airline CEO I am
5:33
angry this he says I am angry my Demand
5:36
on Boeing is what are they going to do
5:38
to improve their quality programs in
5:40
housee and then in addition this Echoes
5:43
what a lot of CEOs say they want to hold
5:46
Boeing accountable they're really
5:47
frustrated with Boeing itself and near
5:51
the end of January something else
5:53
happens that puts some more pressure on
5:55
the airlines that ramps up the
5:57
frustration even more the FAA takes
6:01
further action and orders Boeing to
6:03
limit its planned increase in production
6:06
of all of its 737 Max planes and help me
6:09
understand what that means so the
6:11
federal government is saying you can't
6:12
make this plane anymore basically the
6:14
federal government is limiting how many
6:16
planes Boeing can make and this
6:17
effectively limits how many planes they
6:19
can produce a year so they can focus on
6:21
safety at the end of the year they said
6:23
they were making about 38 planes a month
6:26
and they had hoped to increase that to
6:27
42 planes a month this year and further
6:30
increase that in
6:32
2025 but this really limits that for the
6:34
foreseeable future and possibly for many
6:37
months I mean the federal government is
6:38
effectively saying we don't trust you to
6:40
make this plane properly it basically
6:42
says you cannot ramp up your production
6:44
until you've proven to us that you've
6:45
resolved your quality control issues but
6:48
even with these limits on production the
6:50
FAA still clears the previously grounded
6:53
Max 9's after inspections and after
6:56
they're deemed safe to fly okay but at
6:58
this point you you know a lot of fingers
7:00
are pointing at Boeing but we still
7:02
don't actually know the answer for who's
7:04
responsible for this door blowout yeah
7:06
that's right we still don't know who is
7:08
at fault but in early February things
7:11
get worse for Boeing Boeing says that A
7:15
supplier found two milled holes on Max
7:19
planes and this was going to cause them
7:22
to have to rework about 50 planes and
7:25
potentially delay delivery of those
7:27
planes as well Boeing sort of got ahead
7:29
of this and announcing it but it's still
7:32
painting a picture of something is a
7:35
Miss with Boeing and their quality
7:37
control which brings us to last week
7:39
when all of this ends up in Washington
7:41
that's right so on Tuesday morning there
7:43
is a house hearing with the faa's
7:47
administrator Mike Whitaker and he says
7:50
they're going to increase their on the
7:53
ground presence in monitoring Boeing's
7:55
manufacturing but he doesn't face the
7:58
kind of grilling about Boeing that I
7:59
think some thought or hoped he
Door Plug
8:03
might the national Transportation safety
8:06
board has released new information on
8:08
the Alaska Airlines plane that lost a
8:10
door panel but the real bombshell comes
8:12
later in the day when the national
8:14
Transportation safety board releases its
8:17
preliminary report on the incident it
8:20
doesn't have the full accounting of
8:21
everything but it is our first official
8:23
snapshot of what happened what does it
8:26
say what's in the report four bolts like
8:28
this one
8:29
hold the door plug into the side of the
8:32
737 Max 9 there are two at the top and
8:34
two at the bottom this report says there
8:37
are two pairs of bolts on the door plug
8:40
that was supposed to help hold the plug
8:42
in place on the plane's body that's
8:44
critical information as the ntsp tries
8:46
to determine why that door plug blew out
8:49
it appears it simply wasn't at all
8:52
connected properly to the fuselage
8:54
itself at the they weren't there wow it
8:58
says that the bolts were there when the
9:02
plane arrived at Boeing's Renton
9:05
facility in Washington but that there
9:07
had been an issue that was flagged there
9:09
were damag rivets near the door plug and
9:13
in order to fix these rivets the door
9:15
plug had to be opened and so it was
9:17
opened at Boeing's facility and
9:20
somewhere in that process it was put
9:22
back together and there were no bolts
9:25
put back that seems like a pretty bad
9:27
oversight yeah and the NTSB is pretty
9:30
careful not to say who exactly did this
9:33
they don't say who opened the door plug
9:36
or Who removed the bolts but what is
9:39
clear is this happened at Boeing's
9:41
facility in Renton Washington and that
9:43
pins the blame on Boeing even Boeing
9:46
itself would say this happened on our
9:48
manufacturing floor we are should be
9:50
held
9:53
accountable so all of this starts to
9:55
give us the answer to what happened but
9:58
we still don't know
9:59
how this happened especially at Boeing a
10:03
company that's already been under
10:05
scrutiny after the two crashes of its
10:08
Max
10:09
[Music]
10:12
planes we'll be right
10:15
[Music]
FAA and Boeing
10:20
back okay so Sydney we now know the what
10:23
what happened roughly more or less but
10:26
we do not know the answer of how right
10:29
this broader mystery how could this have
10:31
happened again at Boeing so help us
10:35
unpack that well there are still truly
10:38
more questions than answers but one of
10:40
the things this incident did was raise
10:42
more questions about the relationship
10:45
between Boeing and its regulator the
10:47
Federal Aviation Administration in the
10:49
aftermath of two crashes in five months
10:52
us lawmakers grilled the Federal
10:54
Aviation Administration about its
10:56
relationship with Boeing and what we
10:58
learned after the crashes in 2018 and
11:02
2019 was this relationship was really
11:05
complicated a problem with software
11:07
caused the planes to repeatedly nose
11:09
dive when it was meant to stabilize the
11:12
aircraft those crashes were caused by a
11:14
flaw in a new software that was supposed
11:17
to help stabilize the planes an
11:18
independent investigation has found the
11:20
FAA itself was not fully aware of a new
11:24
system on the plane and the FAA
11:26
delegated a high percentage of approvals
11:29
allowing Boeing to certify much of its
11:31
own work the FAA handed Boeing the
11:33
responsibility for determining the
11:35
safety of that system and basically
11:37
delegated regulatory authority to Boeing
11:40
like Fox guarding the hen house type
11:42
thing exactly but there is a reason for
11:45
this the FAA has limited resources and
11:49
they don't have enough people to have
11:52
enough inspectors on the ground
11:54
themselves and also building an airplane
11:57
is really hard and the people who know
12:00
how to do it the best and who know how
12:02
the plane works the best are the Boeing
12:05
engineers and Boeing Employees who build
12:07
it but this doesn't change the fact that
12:10
there were actually very few FAA
12:12
inspectors at Boeing's facility just a
12:15
small handful compared to the more than
12:16
10,000 employees who worked in Renton so
12:19
even before the crashes Boeing Employees
12:23
were starting to blow the whistle about
12:25
this saying the relationship between
12:27
Boeing and the FAA could cause safety
12:30
issues I mean this is a really hard
12:33
problem right I used to write about the
12:35
drug industry and the Food and Drug
12:37
Administration and it was the same thing
12:38
there you know a small tiny handful of
12:41
inspectors for drug companies with
12:43
thousands of people very difficult to
12:47
actually police the things when you're
12:49
the federal government you're
12:50
potentially underfunded like the federal
12:53
inspectors to some extent are totally
12:55
outgunned but there was supposed to be a
12:59
whole Reckoning after those earlier
13:01
crashes right there were lessons that
13:04
had been drawn at that point about the
13:06
dangers of this fox guarding the hen
13:08
house what happened did anything change
13:11
there were some changes after the
13:13
crashes in 2018 and 2019 the FAA took
13:17
back the authority to determine whether
13:21
Boe planes were safe to fly and so now
13:24
it's the FAA who determines the
13:26
airworthiness of Boeing planes there
13:28
were also some other steps that both
13:31
Boeing and the FAA took to ensure that
13:33
this system where the FAA delegate some
13:37
of the Authority for inspections to
13:39
Boeing works better and then in the
13:42
immediate aftermath of the incident in
13:44
January of this year the FAA did start
13:47
putting more inspectors at Boeing's
13:50
facility in Renton in fact the FAA
13:53
administrator said he put 20 additional
13:56
inspectors still this is not a huge huge
13:59
number of inspectors but you can see how
14:02
there would be criticism that the FAA
14:04
itself doesn't have enough people over
14:06
seeing Boeing as it should okay so
14:09
federal inspectors are clearly very
14:11
outgunned but in this case you know as
14:14
we've said Boeing is really front and
14:16
center this incident happened at the
14:19
Boeing factory so my question I guess is
14:22
the same as I had for the federal
14:24
Regulators when it comes to you know
14:25
what's different from those past years
14:28
what changed at Boeing after those big
14:30
crashes well after the crashes in 2018
14:33
and 2019 a lot of blame was put on this
14:36
cultural shift that occurred at Boeing
14:38
in the
14:39
1990s when there was a merger between
14:42
Boeing and another airplane manufacturer
14:44
McDonald Douglas and what a lot of
14:48
people will say is the culture at Boeing
14:50
shifted from an emphasis on engineering
14:53
to an emphasis on profits and
14:55
shareholders and this is a criticism
14:58
that you'll hear a lot especially from
15:01
oldtimers at Boeing or former Boeing
15:04
Employees so after the crashes Boeing
15:07
did make a handful of changes its whole
15:10
leadership changed its CEO was fired and
15:14
the company brought on new board members
15:16
who had engineering and safety expertise
15:20
and that was of course back then right
15:22
after those twin crashes in 2018 and
15:24
2019 what are they saying now about
15:27
those measures
15:29
so they're very clearly saying that all
15:31
of the changes they implemented after
15:33
the crashes were not enough that this
15:35
incident on January 5th indicates that
15:38
they need to still do a lot more and so
15:41
they've done a few things one of the
15:43
things they've done is they said they
15:45
would make changes to the quality
15:48
control processes and that includes at
15:51
its own Factory and also at its
15:53
suppliers Factory at Spirit Aeros
15:55
systems and then one of the biggest
15:57
things they did was when they announced
15:59
their earnings for the fourth quarter
16:01
they suspended their financial guidance
16:03
for the year essentially saying this was
16:06
not the time to focus on financial
16:07
performance it was a time to focus on
16:10
safety so a few moves here by Boeing and
16:12
a healthy dose of PR it sounds like to
16:14
convince its customers you know the
16:16
airlines that it's actually focused on
16:19
safety and do the customers believe it
16:22
so that's still a little unclear Some of
16:25
the airline customers have said publicly
16:27
that they're sending their own
16:29
inspectors to Boeing's facility to
16:31
monitor the manufacturing process but at
16:34
least one CEO the CEO of United Airlines
16:37
has suggested that he might move his
16:40
business elsewhere to another plane
16:43
maker like Airbus oh wow okay so that
16:47
seems quite significant you know that
16:50
customers would potentially be voting
16:51
with their feet and going to a
16:53
competitor is there any chance that this
16:55
could actually be existential for Boeing
16:59
like that Airlines will really start
17:01
giving their business to Boeing's big
17:03
competitor I think that's still a really
17:06
open question I mean remember Boeing is
17:09
an American Juggernaut it's a really
17:11
important company for the American
17:13
economy and also there are only two real
17:17
airplane companies that make these
17:19
planes there's Boeing and there's Airbus
17:22
and it's a very complicated process to
17:26
change how you're going to design your
17:28
fleets and to Pivot if you're unhappy
17:31
these planes take a while to make and a
17:33
while to deliver you know Airbus can't
17:36
possibly make all of the planes and
17:37
neither can Boeing so I I I don't think
17:40
this is going to be an existential
17:42
crisis for Boeing at this point but I
17:44
think there is mounting frustration
17:46
there is the sense of disbelief that you
17:49
had 5 years to improve these really
17:52
catastrophic crashes happened you vowed
17:55
to do better everyone vowed to do better
17:57
and yet here we are again
17:58
and so I do think Boeing has a lot of
18:01
questions it needs to answer and a lot
18:02
of reassurance it needs to give
Should I be worried
18:05
[Music]
18:08
customers so Sydney I'm going to ask you
18:10
the question that probably a lot of our
18:12
listeners will have at this point and
18:14
that is should I be worried about flying
18:18
on one of these planes I think this is a
18:20
question that's front and center for a
18:22
lot of people right now but the fact is
18:25
you have to remember that flying is
18:27
incredibly incredibly safe there hasn't
18:30
been an fatal accident involving a major
18:33
US Airline in more than a decade oh wow
18:35
you're actually statistically more
18:37
likely to die in a car accident on the
18:40
way to the airport than you are on the
18:43
plane so it is really really safe to
18:46
fly but I think the fact that you're
18:48
asking this and others are asking this
18:51
really could be a problem for Boeing and
18:53
really suggest that Boeing needs to
18:55
solve the safety problems it's having
18:58
[Music]
19:03
Sydney thank you thank you
19:07
[Music]
19:13
Sabrina we'll be right
What else you should know
19:19
back here's what else you should know
19:21
today over the weekend Democrats went on
19:24
the defensive to discredit what they
19:26
said was a partisan hit on President
19:28
Biden by special counsel Robert her this
19:32
is a report that went off the rails it's
19:34
chabby work product let's Bob Bower the
19:36
president's personal lawyer said on CBS
19:39
Face the Nation that the report was
19:41
substandard and so along with the legal
19:43
conclusion Comes This flood of
19:46
characterizations factual misation
19:48
perjorative comments about the president
19:51
that are inconsistent with doj policy
19:54
and Norms her's report issued last week
19:58
cleared Biden of wrongdoing in his
20:00
handling of classified documents but
20:02
characterized him as elderly and
20:05
forgetful the report put a spotlight on
20:07
what was already a primary concern for
20:10
voters Biden's age in a New York Times
20:13
Sienna College poll this fall More than
20:16
70% of battleground State voters agreed
20:19
that Biden was too old to Be an
20:21
Effective
20:23
president and I said you didn't pay your
20:27
delinquent you said yes let's say that
20:30
happened no I would not protect you in
20:32
fact I would encourage them to do
20:34
whatever the hell they want you got at a
20:35
rally in South Carolina former president
20:38
Donald Trump claimed that while he was
