The Unhappy Voters Who Could Swing the Election



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
tavernes and this is the
0:05
daily millions of Voters in States
0:08
across the country cast their ballots in
0:10
the presidential primary on super
0:12
Tuesday leaving little doubt that the
0:14
November election will be a rematch
0:16
between Joe Biden and Donald Trump but
0:20
in a race that's increasingly inevitable
0:22
a New York Times SI College poll shows
0:25
there's a critical group of Voters that
0:27
are making the outcome of that race
0:30
anything but today my colleague Nate Con
0:35
on who those voters are and why they
0:38
represent a particular threat to Joe
0:44
Biden it's Wednesday March
0:48
6th Nate hello hello how are you hello
0:51
hello how's it going it's going well how
0:54
are you good it's h it's a little rainy
0:57
my feet are stopping wet oh I did the
0:59
Subway so did I I'm going to I'm going
1:02
to shut the uh shut the door here
1:05
yeah so Nate super Tuesday has just
1:08
happened which means of course more than
1:10
a dozen states have voted in their
1:12
primaries and President Biden and former
1:14
president Trump continue to sail to
1:16
their respective nominations I mean you
1:18
know at this point there is really no
1:20
suspense at all barring something
1:22
extremely unexpected whether they will
1:24
be the nominees in the general election
1:27
that's right nearly half of all the
1:29
delegates at state have been awarded and
1:31
Biden and Trump have won nearly all of
1:33
them so they are right now just on the
1:36
cusp of winning a majority of the
1:38
delegates and securing the nomination
1:40
and they'll do that over the next week
1:41
or two okay so to that point the New
1:43
York Times just released a poll about
1:45
how people are feeling about that
1:47
inevitable matchup and that's what we
1:50
want to talk with you about today Nate
1:51
not the results because frankly they're
1:53
not all that surprising but instead this
1:56
poll that gets at how voters are
1:58
actually thinking about their choices in
2:00
this election so tell me about this poll
2:03
the Topline result is that voters are
2:05
not happy about this upcoming election
2:07
when we ask them in an open-ended
2:08
question they say that they're
2:10
frustrated they're disappointed that
2:12
they're anxious they're scared they
2:13
offer negative or at least uncertain
2:16
feelings about the election that's in no
2:18
small part because they don't like
2:19
either of the candidates they don't have
2:21
a favorable view of either Joe Biden or
2:23
Donald Trump but when we ask them to
2:25
choose how they would vote if the
2:26
election were held today Trump is firmly
2:28
in the lead he's Up by Five Points among
2:30
registered voters and four points among
2:32
those who we think are likeliest to vote
2:35
and that's the largest lead by the way
2:37
that Trump has ever had in a times
2:39
Sienna or times CBS poll and it's really
2:42
one of the largest leads that a
2:43
Republican presidential candidate has
2:44
had period over the last 20 years since
2:46
George W bush LED John krey so this is
2:49
pretty remarkable I mean a peak for his
2:52
entire career in politics really one of
2:54
the highest ever leads I mean this is
2:58
probably in Biden camp Camp raising some
3:00
real alarms you would think and it's
3:02
worth noting it is not just our poll
3:03
here all of the polls show Donald Trump
3:06
leading in the critical Battleground
3:08
States worth more than the 270 electoral
3:10
votes he needs to win there were other
3:12
polls this weekend that showed Trump in
3:13
the lead CBS FOX News so there's a
3:16
consensus at this point that Donald
3:18
Trump has a lead and he's had it now for
3:19
four months this is a sustained and
3:20
clear Advantage okay so voters aren't
3:23
feeling too great about their options
3:25
but with the options that they do have
3:26
they're leaning towards Trump In This
3:28
Moment by pretty meaningful margin
3:31
that's right and it's worth dwelling on
3:33
why Trump has the lead and why that's
3:35
related to this dissatisfaction when we
3:37
pulled voters four years ago a majority
3:40
of Voters said they had a favorable view
3:42
of Joe Biden and a majority of Voters
3:44
said they had an unfavorable view of
3:46
Donald Trump four years later Donald
3:48
Trump's numbers are almost exactly the
3:49
same in our final poll in 2020 54% said
3:52
they had an unfavorable view of Donald
3:53
Trump today 54% say they have an
3:56
nonfavorable view of Donald Trump so not
3:58
much difference there but the Top Line
4:00
result is completely different and
4:01
that's because Joe Biden has gone from
4:03
being a broadly acceptable relatively
4:05
well-liked figure who for years ago 52%
4:08
of Voters said they had a favorable view
4:10
of to a pretty unpopular candidate who
4:13
voters are very skeptical of now 38% of
4:16
Voters have a favorable view of him his
4:17
job approval rating is even less than
4:19
that so big change in the Biden category
4:22
huge change it completely flips around
4:25
the fundamental premise of the Biden
4:27
campaign from 2020 last time Joe was the
4:30
guy who was acceptable to enough people
4:32
who disliked Donald Trump that he could
4:34
win that's why Democrats chose him over
4:36
someone more controversial like
4:37
Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders it's
4:39
not true anymore okay so tell us about
4:41
the voters who are driving this change
4:44
this dissatisfaction with Biden the
4:46
easiest way to think about it is that
4:48
there's this group of Voters who dislike
4:50
both candidates and this is a really
4:52
important group that bolsters like to
4:54
call the double haters double haters
4:57
double haters they don't like either of
4:58
them twice
5:00
and they really have the potential to
5:03
decide this
5:05
election so give me a sense of who these
5:07
voters are well the double haters are
5:09
about 19% of the electorate in our poll
5:12
and that's up from 5% in 2020 so it's a
5:15
big increase increase and last time they
5:17
voted for Biden by a 3 to1 margin and
5:20
you know they're a mixed
5:22
bag when you call them up Hello Hello
5:26
Hello whoa I really never expected a
5:28
reported
5:30
call they tell you all kinds of
5:32
different things it's really the age one
5:35
of the main things is just his age he's
5:37
past his prime he doesn't really know
5:38
what's going on many of them think Joe
5:41
Biden is just too old to Be an Effective
5:42
president I think Joe Biden is a lovely
5:46
older gentleman that should resign at
5:50
some
5:51
point but other than that economically
5:55
we've been in the dump some of them say
5:58
that they are deeply dissatisfied about
6:01
the cost of living being 20% higher than
6:03
it was 4 years ago don't make food more
6:05
expensive we all buy it it's very
6:07
obvious and for people who have lower
6:09
income on a grade level I would probably
6:12
give him a th minus and you can imagine
6:16
different people different archetypes of
6:18
people who would have liked Biden last
6:19
time but have soured on him now I mean
6:21
I'm horrified to think in this country
6:24
this is the best we can come up with for
6:26
the next four years to be a president
6:29
and have a moderate voter who maybe
6:32
reluctantly voted for Joe Biden in 2020
6:35
because they didn't like Donald Trump
6:37
but Joe Biden has kind of like walked in
6:40
and just has let this country get
6:43
overrun with all kinds of just stuff
6:46
happening I just now just thinks that
6:48
the Administration has done a poor job
6:49
at the border or on foreign policy or
6:52
spent too much money and hasn't rained
6:54
in the national debt I would probably
6:56
consider myself a leftist leaning more
6:59
towards the left pretty Progressive kind
7:01
of you can imagine a voter on the left
7:03
continuing to back Israel in Gaza has
7:07
been particularly disappointing would be
7:09
a very mild way to put it who is
7:11
frustrated by Biden's handling of Gaza
7:14
also considering his policies are stuck
7:15
decades in the past or thinks that the
7:18
Administration has failed to be
7:19
sufficiently Progressive in its domestic
7:21
agenda you know I'm I'm not very excited
7:24
right
7:26
now and what's particularly notable is
7:29
that that this group of double haters
7:31
includes young voters black voters and
7:33
Latino voters the kinds of Voters that
7:35
Democrats usually count on to win
7:36
elections and in the end this very
7:39
diverse group of Voters is pretty split
7:41
on how they'll vote in the next
7:46
election split how exactly like how are
7:49
these voters thinking about their vote
7:51
in this moment I mean they're double
7:52
haters as you say so they don't love
7:54
either candidate but do we have a sense
7:57
of which way they're leaning right now
7:59
you when I said split I meant that they
8:02
are deeply unhappy with their choice and
8:04
as a consequence they are splitting in
8:06
all kinds of
8:07
[Music]
8:09
ways I do plan on voting for Joe Biden
8:12
unless somebody else magically comes to
8:14
the Forefront before then some of them
8:17
say that they'll vote for Biden I have
8:18
no other choice but to stick with them
8:20
we're just being forced to pick
8:22
essentially the lesser of two evils and
8:24
some of them I honestly don't think I'm
8:27
going to vote say they're simply not
8:28
going to vote there's no good outcomer
8:30
regardless if we win so it doesn't
8:31
matter in the general for the presidency
8:34
I will be voting for a third party this
8:35
year others say they'll vote for a minor
8:39
Party candidate my first time since I
8:41
think the the fourth grade when we got
8:43
to do a mock ballot and I voted for
8:45
nater I think it was the fourth grade I
8:48
don't really I guess I'd have to really
8:49
do some soul searching and try and
8:51
figure out who's going to do the least
8:53
amount of damage still others they just
8:55
throw up their hands and say that
8:56
they're
8:57
undecided I could say it would probably
9:00
take a lot of whne for me to figure out
9:01
what I'm going to do but I I don't
9:03
really I definitely leaning more towards
9:07
Donald Trump uh and some of them will
9:09
vote for Trump I'm just picking the
9:11
least horrible Al alternative and I
9:14
think that that's Donald Trump this time
9:16
around if you had told yourself back in
9:19
2020 that you'd vote for Trump in 2024
9:23
what do you think your reaction would
9:25
have
9:26
been I Pro it would have been like a
9:29
slapped in the face
9:33
[Music]
9:37
probably wow okay so Biden might
9:39
actually be driving these voters voters
9:41
who actually voted for him in 2020 into
9:44
the arms of trump and even if some of
9:46
these voters don't actually switch sides
9:50
they might just stay home as you say or
9:52
vote third party which would also be
9:54
pretty damaging for Biden that's right
9:56
and it's worth remembering that the last
9:57
election was pretty close Joe Biden only
9:59
won the critical Battleground states by
10:02
less than a percentage point in most
10:04
cases so he does not have room to
10:07
bleed a huge chunk of his support among
10:09
young black and Latino
10:11
[Music]
10:13
voters and the critical question for
10:15
this election is whether these voters
10:17
remain this dissatisfied with Joe Biden
10:20
8 months from
10:22
[Music]
10:27
now will be right
10:31
back so Nate from everything you've said
10:33
this election could really come down to
10:35
these voters who are legitimately torn
10:38
over what to do I know it's early we're
10:41
eight months out and we know how these
10:44
voters are leaning but do we have a
10:46
sense of where they'll land come
10:48
election day the short answer is no I
10:50
mean there's a long way until the
10:51
election but you know to try and at
10:53
least get a sense of where this could
10:56
head and to see the lay of the land you
10:58
know I like to look back at historical
11:00
examples that feel somewhat like this
11:01
moment and oddly enough I think the
11:04
example that comes to my mind isn't 2020
11:07
even though this is a rematch but
11:10
2016 the election between Trump and
11:13
Clinton okay so tell me about 2016 what
11:16
is it about that election that feels
11:17
analogous to you the thing that is most
11:20
analogous is that 2016 also featured a
11:23
large number of these double haters
11:25
voters who didn't like either Hillary
11:27
Clinton or Donald Trump in fact there
11:28
were more double haters in that election
11:30
really than in this one and there's a
11:33
lot about the way that race played out
11:36
that already feels reminiscent of the
11:37
polling today one obvious example is the
11:39
large number of people who are flirting
11:40
with third party candidates back in 2016
11:43
Gary Johnson actually peaked around 10%
11:45
of the vote it's a little bit like how
11:47
Robert keny Jr is routinely polling
11:49
around 10% of the vote in the polls that
11:50
are asking about him at this point and
11:53
there were also in that election a large
11:55
number of traditionally Democratic and
11:57
Republican voters who were not behaving
11:59
like traditionally Democratic and
12:01
Republican voters in the polls when they
12:03
were being given this choice they didn't
12:05
want to make how do you mean there were
12:07
a lot of blue collar democrats for
12:08
instance who were deeply frustrated with
12:10
Hillary Clinton's position on free trade
12:14
or on immigration and who were actually
12:16
a little bit tempted by some of what
12:17
Donald Trump had to offer on remember
12:19
well working class whites and on the
12:20
other hand there were also a lot of
12:22
Highly Educated Republicans who didn't
12:23
like Donald Trump that was partly on the
12:26
issues right because of his stances on
12:28
immigration or opposition to entitlement
12:30
cuts it was also though because of his
12:32
conduct he routinely said things that
12:35
were considered inappropriate or even
12:37
offensive and that repelled a lot of
12:39
traditionally Republican voters as well
12:41
and so the polls showed a large number
12:43
of Voters who were traditionally
12:45
Republican or traditionally Democrat who
12:46
were frustrated by both candidates and
12:48
were either undecided considering doing
12:50
something shocking like voting for the
12:52
other party or supporting a minor Party
12:54
candidate in that election Gary Johnson
12:56
interesting so in the way that Biden is
12:58
struggling with his traditional
12:59
Coalition in 2024 we saw both Clinton
13:02
and Trump having that same struggle in
13:04
2016 Clinton of course with blue Coller
13:06
Democrats Trump with some subset of
13:09
traditional Republicans College grads
13:11
people like that exactly and it created
13:13
a very volatile campaign and depending
13:16
on what the news was at any given point
13:18
these undecided voters who were
13:19
conflicted between the two candidates
13:21
could swing between the two sides very
13:24
abruptly because just depending on
13:26
whether on any given day you were
13:27
thinking about the thing that upset you
13:29
most about Hillary or Donald Trump you
13:30
could give a pollster a completely
13:31
different answer and Nate what were some
13:33
examples of those swings well you may
13:36
remember that in the summer of 2016 that
13:39
Jim Comey at once exonerated Hillary
13:42
Clinton on the email server front but
13:44
then in the same press conference
13:45
scolded her conduct as you know
13:47
inappropriate and negligent and there
13:49
was actually a moment after that where
13:50
Donald Trump surged into a very brief
13:53
lead around the Republican convention
13:55
and then you know just a few weeks later
13:56
Donald Trump would do something
13:57
offensive that would blow blow it all up
13:59
um I remember for instance that at the
14:01
Democratic Convention there was a gold
14:03
star parent who spoke on behalf of
14:06
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spent a
14:08
week going after the parent of a soldier
14:11
who had died in Afghanistan right it
14:13
just seemed so shocking exactly then
14:16
Hillary Clinton would surge back into
14:17
the lead and as a result of this you
14:20
know sort of back and forth between good
14:22
news and bad news for these two deeply
14:24
disliked candidates the polls would
14:26
swing as well and a wide range of
14:28
possibil became pretty evident and there
14:30
was no way to know until the election
14:32
which of those possibilities was where
14:34
the voters would land in the end so how
14:37
might we see that kind of volatility
14:40
play out this time around this time most
14:43
of the volatility is on the Biden side
14:45
as we mentioned Donald Trump's
14:46
favorability ratings are pretty solid at
14:49
this point unlike in 2016 Republicans
14:52
have mostly unified around him I'll
14:54
point out by the way that the Haley vote
14:55
is mostly voters who voted for Biden in
14:57
2020 inter
14:59
so almost all of this swing can happen
15:01
on the Democratic side and here again we
15:04
have this wide range of possibilities
15:05
right if it's really true that young
15:08
black latino also relatively moderate
15:11
Haley voters and so on that this group
15:13
of double haters is so negative on Joe
15:15
Biden that they'll vote for Donald Trump
15:17
trump could win a decisive Victory but
15:20
on the other hand if these voters are
15:22
reminded of why they voted for Joe Biden
15:26
four years ago reminded of the reasons
15:27
they don't like Donald Trump then you
15:30
could get a very different outcome you
15:31
know there's been a phenomenon that
15:33
people have talked about called Trump
15:34
Amnesia where many voters have sort of
15:37
forgotten about many of the things that
15:39
led them to dislike Donald Trump so much
15:41
in the first place and it's worth
15:42
remembering what 2016 or 2020 was like
15:45
right I mean every week Donald Trump did
15:47
something that offended a new group of
15:48
Voters whether was women or Latino
15:50
voters or his handling of the black
15:51
lives matter Movement we haven't had
15:53
anything like that this cycle now maybe
15:55
that means that Donald Trump has become
15:57
a more effective politician that's maybe
15:59
that's what we'll learn or maybe it's
16:01
just a matter of time that once the
16:02
campaign gets underway once the general
16:04
election begins that Donald Trump is
16:06
going to be in the news more he's going
16:07
defend voters yet again and even if he
16:10
doesn't the Joe Biden campaign can hope
16:11
to remind voters of the reasons why they
16:13
didn't like Donald Trump in the first
16:14
place and it's entirely possible that if
16:17
that plays out that if voters are
16:19
reminded of the reasons they dislike
16:20
Donald Trump as the election near that
16:22
this large group of Voters that voted
16:24
for Joe Biden last time that dislikes
16:25
him today will ultimately return to his
16:27
side because they dislike Donald Trump
16:28
even more and presumably all of this
16:31
could really lead to a lot of swinging
16:33
back and forth in the polls this time
16:35
around right it could I mean it depends
16:37
on how the news plays out right I mean
16:38
to the 2016 example that volatility
16:40
required a very volatile news cycle that
16:43
led voters to swaying back and forth if
16:46
Donald Trump comes into the news one
16:48
week and says the most defensive thing
16:50
imaginable about Palestinians and black
16:53
and Latino voters maybe Joe Biden can
16:55
Surge and quickly reconsolidate these
16:57
voters and then if the very next week
16:59
Joe Biden has you know a moment where he
17:01
doesn't look up to the job then maybe
17:02
those voters swing back right that's the
17:04
sort of case where you could see that
17:05
volatility but even if you don't see
17:07
that volatility in the polls the
17:08
underlying like instability of the
17:11
preference of Voters is still there
17:13
these are regardless of whether the
17:14
polls swing these are still voters
17:16
agonizing over a choice they don't want
17:18
to make and that still creates the basis
17:20
for the polls to swing regardless of
17:22
whether they actually do yeah so n what
17:24
about the ultimate outcome I mean what
17:27
lessons can we take from 2016 that might
17:30
show us what this could look like in the
17:33
final vote tally in November well I
17:35
don't want 2016 to you know seem like
17:37
it's going to predict the outcome but
17:39
you know in the end in 2016 many of the
17:41
traditionally Republican voters who
17:43
dislike Donald Trump did return to his
17:45
side they didn't want to vote for him
17:47
they really didn't yeah but in the end
17:49
when they got into The Ballot Box they
17:51
voted for him and they did so because
17:54
they were Republican voters and they
17:55
couldn't in the end get around to voting
17:57
for it Democrat they disliked like
17:59
Hillary Clinton yeah and I think that
18:01
for Joe Biden that's a pretty favorable
18:03
precedent you know just to take one
18:04
example from this poll more than 10% of
18:07
black Democrats who voted for Joe Biden
18:10
say they're going to vote for Donald
18:11
Trump wow now maybe they'll do that in
18:13
the end yeah but when they get into The
18:15
Ballot Box are voters like that really
18:17
going to vote for Donald Trump as
18:19
opposed to just saying it to a pller
18:20
with eight months ago I don't know but I
18:23
know that in 2016 that that's exactly
18:25
the kind of dynamic that didn't hold on
18:27
election day and those came back to
18:29
Donald Trump at the end they came back
18:31
to their tribe right they did it took
18:33
all the way to the end but they did it
18:35
so to the extent that the polls today
18:37
would lead someone to believe that Joe
18:39
Biden can't win you know I think that
18:40
would be a mistake given the
18:42
characteristics of the voters who are
18:43
currently giving Donald Trump the lead
18:45
got it so the potential bright spot here
18:47
for Biden is that history tells us that
18:50
these voters do tend to come back to
18:52
their party but that it's not guaranteed
18:54
right it's a big if that's right and
18:56
that's especially true when sort of the
18:57
under Ling political conditions ought to
18:59
be favorable to the candidate hoping to
19:01
coales their own party support I mean
19:03
this is an election Joe Biden should win
19:06
he's an incumbent president running for
19:07
re-election and the economy is healthy
19:09
enough usually you win under those
19:11
conditions and that's before considering
19:13
that your opponent is accused of
19:15
multiple federal crimes so the political
19:16
science seminar would tell us this is a
19:18
win for Biden yeah if this was a test in
19:20
some political science seminar class you
19:23
were given the conditions we've got
19:24
today and the nature of Joe Biden's
19:26
opponent you would say Joe Biden should
19:28
win this election and so you're hoping
19:30
if you're the Biden campaign that those
19:33
underlying political conditions mean
19:35
that these voters are probably likelier
19:37
than not to come back to your side on
19:39
the other hand Biden's unusually weak he
19:41
has the lowest approval ratings of any
19:44
president seeking re-election at this
19:45
point in his term his age is an
19:49
extremely unusual factor that might
19:51
prove to just be disqualifying for a
19:54
certain share of Voters not exactly
19:56
something he can do anything about yes
19:58
so you have a president who has some of
20:00
the lowest ratings on record who faces a
20:03
problem that would be very difficult for
20:05
him to address and we just don't know
20:09
whether that is something that will
20:10
prevent him from capitalizing on what
20:12
should be a favorable opportunity here
20:14
we've never seen anything like this
20:18
before so if I've learned nothing else
20:21
from this conversation Nate it is that
20:23
we are in for a very volatile very
20:25
unpredictable election it could be very
20:28
and it's definitely difficult to
20:32
predict Nate thank you Sabrina thanks
20:34
for having
20:37
[Music]
20:43
me we'll be right
20:53
back here's what else you should know
20:56
today on Tuesday Senator Kiren Cinema of
20:59
Arizona said that she would not seek
21:02
re-election ending more than a year of
21:04
speculation about her political future
21:07
Cinema has had a dramatic tenure in
21:09
Washington winning her seat as a
21:11
Democrat but then switching her party
21:13
affiliation to Independent in
21:16
2022 she supported some parts of
21:18
President Biden's agenda but Democratic
21:21
activists had criticized what they said
21:23
was her eagerness to side with business
21:25
interests above Progressive causes her
21:28
decision to bow out of the race now sets
21:31
up a more traditional matchup between
21:33
the eventual Republican and Democratic
21:35
nominees in a critical state that could
21:38
determine which party wins control of
21:40
the senate in
21:43
November and President Biden said that
21:46
talks on a possible 6-week ceasefire and
21:49
hostage release deal between Israel and
21:51
Hamas were quote in the hands of Hamas
21:54
right now he said negotiators were
21:57
racing to reach a deal before the
21:59
Islamic holy month of Ramadan which
22:01
begins this weekend as a continued
22:04
Israeli Onslaught during the holiday
22:06
could further inflame Arab Israeli
22:08
tensions but later on Tuesday a senior
22:11
Hamas leader speaking in Lebanon
22:14
appeared to reject the deal insisting
22:16
that Israeli hostages would be released
22:19
only after a more permanent ceasefire
22:21
was in place and Israeli forces had
22:24
withdrawn from
22:26
