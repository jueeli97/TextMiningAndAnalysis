0:19
it's played to its economics and who is
0:23

0:26

[Music]

0:49
[Music]
0:51
21st Matt hello welcome to the show
Welcome to March Madness
0:55
thank you so much and welcome to March
0:56
Madness welcome to March Madness
0:58
America here we go so Matt the NCAA
1:02
basketball tournament starts this week
1:05
and the biggest star this year is a
1:07
woman Caitlyn Clark she's someone who
1:10
even a year ago was not a household name
1:13
but here we are devoting an entire daily
1:16
episode to her so for the
1:19
uninitiated tell me why well Caitlyn
1:22
Clark is the most famous college
1:24
basketball player in America she's a
1:26
senior at the University of Iowa she is
1:28
22 years old and she has become this
1:30
sort of electric
The Caitlin Clark Phenomenon
1:38
phenomenon she is selling out Arenas and
1:41
really being this sort of Master of
1:44
Ceremonies at every game that she's in
1:46
there is a quality to her um when you
1:49
walk into the arena you know that she is
1:51
the person that everyone has come to see
1:54
every camera is pointed at her every
1:56
cell phone is pointed at her every fan
1:58
is watching her warm up any sort of
2:01
mundane activity happens on the court
2:03
she grabs a rebound she's getting a pass
2:05
there's the sort of anxious hush like
2:07
there's just this quality of you don't
2:09
know what's going to happen
2:15
next and Beyond being a sports story the
Beyond being a sports story
2:18
story of Caitlyn Clark is really about
2:20
this kind of broader cultural phenomenon
2:22
and really speaks to uh sea change in
2:26
the way that women's sports are being
2:28
consumed so this really reminds me of
2:30
when I was in high school in the 1980s
2:32
in Massachusetts and there was this
2:34
player Larry Bird who played for the
2:36
Boston Celtics and he was just electric
2:40
and everybody wanted to watch this guy
2:42
play I mean he drew me into a game I
2:46
ordinarily probably would not have been
2:48
interested in because he was such a good
2:50
player and he was Massachusetts you know
2:52
it was my team and it sounds like this
2:54
is something that Caitlyn Clark is now
2:56
doing for women's basketball so tell me
2:59
about her how did she begin what's her
3:01
story Kaitlin Clark has this kind of
3:04
sports movie origin
Childhood
3:06
story and her story is something she's
3:08
talked about quite a bit in interviews
3:10
in her postgame press conferences so I'm
3:12
an Iowa kid I grew up here I grew up
3:14
rooting for the Hawkeyes um her Story
3:16
begins in Iowa in West de Mo about 2
3:19
hours from the University campus um
3:21
we're definitely a sports family more
3:22
than anything she is from a family of
3:25
athletes she has two brothers I was
3:28
super competitive so I think that kind
3:29
of like fueled me and wanted to play
3:31
sports especially basketball and she has
3:33
this hyper competitive streak that her
3:35
family has talked about from an early
3:36
age her brother needs you know Staples
3:39
in his head after a Nerf game goes
3:41
sideways there's this sense that she's
3:44
really wired a certain
3:46
way I honestly started playing sports
3:49
with boys before girls I and she really
3:51
starts to play with the boys both in her
3:53
family and otherwise I've won like
3:55
League MVP one year and like parents
3:57
were mad they're like this is a boys
3:58
League how can a girl be the MVP so I
4:01
was just and she's you know shooting
4:03
Hoops in the driveway eventually her
4:05
range becomes so extensive that her dad
4:08
has to take some grass out of the lawn
4:10
to make more driveway so she can shoot
4:12
from further away gosh amazing she also
4:15
has Role Models Maya Moore she's like my
4:17
first ever WNBA game I actually met her
4:19
which is and Maya Moore she has this
4:21
story she likes to tell of seeing her
4:22
play all I ever wanted to do is meet her
4:24
I didn't have a phone so I just ran over
4:26
gave her a hug ran away it's like the
4:28
most vivid memory I have of like woman's
4:30
basketball growing up and and sort of
4:32
sees herself following that
4:37
tradition and then as a teenager she
4:40
becomes enough of a sort of buzzed about
4:43
basketball player that even some really
4:45
prominent National figures like Kevin
4:46
Durant the men's basketball player start
4:48
to notice her and she winds up
4:51
committing to the University of Iowa
4:53
staying in her home state um and it was
4:55
immediately clear that the program which
4:57
you know I think was seen as like a
4:59
solid program not necessarily a
5:01
perennial Powerhouse was going to be
5:04
seen in a different way with somebody
5:05
like Caitlin on the roster so the team
5:07
was okay and suddenly it was getting
5:09
this incredible player this incredible
5:11
player this sort of generational talent
5:14
and somebody who coaches have talked
5:15
about really having to to Bridal is a
5:17
word that they use um as if she were a
5:20
racehorse something that they had to
5:22
sort of figure out how to make exist in
5:24
a team context okay Bridal is an
5:27
interesting word what about her her
5:30
specifically was different than other
5:32
players on the team she just had talents
5:35
that not a lot of players had and her
5:38
coaches and teammates have talked about
5:40
her own expectations of herself being so
5:42
high that sometimes her expectations of
5:43
her teammates were such that she could
5:45
be disappointed if they bobbled a pass
5:48
that she threw that they didn't expect
5:50
if they missed a shot off of some pass
5:52
of hers if the coaches did something
5:54
that she didn't necessarily think was
5:56
wise so there was this sort of sort of a
5:58
learning curve for her and for the team
5:59
and her coaches for how to best Channel
6:02
all of that in a team
Shooting
6:04
setting here's Clark she fires and it
6:08
goes she hit it but certainly the talent
6:12
was clear wow she was you know a leading
6:14
scorer as a freshman holy smokes another
6:19
deep three from Kaitlyn Clark she was
6:23
taking these long three-pointers from
6:26
all over the court Clark from the logo
6:29
there's a logo at midc court in Iowa
6:31
that's a sort of Hawkeye beak
6:34
Clark oh my gosh and um she's taking
6:37
shots from like the edge of the beak huh
6:39
in other words from very far out right
6:42
from very far out with this just
6:44
boundless shooting range you know
6:46
pulling up from places on the court that
6:49
most players wouldn't conceive of
6:50
shooting from and consistently making
6:52
shots and having a defense need to sort
6:55
of account for her so far away from the
6:57
basket creates room for other players to
6:59
operate
7:00
[Music]
March Madness
7:04
okay so when does she go to
7:06
stratospheric fame with that so in last
7:09
year's NCAA tournament March Madness
7:12
round after round she is just carrying
7:14
Iowa with these spectacular viral
7:16
moments these incredible passes with a
7:19
roster that's not necessarily considered
7:21
a real powerhouse in the tournament and
7:24
it's compelling to watch obviously
7:25
seeing somebody shoot from that far
7:26
seeing somebody carry a team like that
7:29
be beating teams that maybe seemed more
7:31
formidable than Iowa and the attention
7:34
grows she acquires a nickname at the
7:37
time ponytail Pete after Pete marovich
7:39
who was an incredible college basketball
7:41
player and professional in the 60s and
7:42
70s he did not have a ponytail he did
7:45
not have a ponytail he had pretty shaggy
7:47
hair he maybe could have had a ponytail
7:48
if he wanted to and has this really
7:52
spectacular run all the way to the final
7:54
four where they face off against South
7:56
Carolina seen as the best team in the
7:58
country defeated to that point I was a
8:01
big Underdog and on the strength really
8:05
largely of Caitlyn's Brilliance on the
8:06
court they win um they defeat the sort
8:09
of Goliath they go to the championship
8:12
game and really nobody saw them getting
Final
8:15
that far and the national championship
8:17
game is
8:19
underway so what happens in that final
8:22
game so in that final game it's Iowa
8:24
against LSU Louisiana state Louisiana
8:26
state which is another really compelling
8:29
cast of is a a loaded roster headline by
8:31
Angel Reese their star
8:33
player Angel Reese gorgeous delivery
8:36
inside really colorful coach Kim Moi
8:39
smart awareness by LSU on these
8:41
mismatches in the post and it does sort
8:43
of pit these two programs against each
8:44
other two really compelling casts of
8:47
players and supporting characters
8:49
meeting in this in this epic
8:52
final
8:53
again it's a very competitive game back
8:56
and forth and it's viewed by almost 10
8:58
million people wow which is a Far and
9:00
Away record for a women's final really
9:03
not that far off from the men's final
9:05
and they see a good game
9:06
7164 LSU in front you see the bench
9:09
Advantage it's not down to the wire to
9:12
the very end necessarily a competitive
9:15
game but it's not quite
9:17
enough they
Angel Reese
9:23
lose but the story doesn't necessarily
9:25
end there uh Lindsay with USA St again
9:28
Caitlyn can you tell us
9:30
uh at the end of the game what happened
9:31
there's a lot blown up on Twitter about
9:33
angel Reese following you around in the
9:36
days afterwards there is this sort of
9:37
controversy around Angel Reese and
9:40
Caitlyn Clark essentially over a
9:43
celebration that Caitlin Clark had done
9:45
previously in the tournament that was
9:48
sort of putting her hand in front of her
9:49
face it's called the the you can't see
9:50
me kind of taunting that sort of amounts
9:53
to trash talk on the court so she's
9:54
basically saying haha she's saying haha
9:56
with her hands yeah okay and with the
9:58
scoreboard
9:59
at the time and then in the final when
10:01
LSU is pulling away Angel Reese does the
10:05
same gesture at Clark and is very
10:07
clearly kind of taunting Clark as I was
10:10
about to lose and have their tournament
10:12
run end she was obnoxious yes she was
10:15
obnoxious Keith obman said on the
10:18
comment of this this was his comment on
10:21
a a young woman oh okay who is in
10:25
college winning a championship what an
10:28
effing but spell out the word
The Fallout
10:32
idiot the difference in the Fallout is
10:34
that angel ree who was black faced quite
10:37
a bit of criticism for this taunting the
10:39
sense that it was unsportsmanlike I'm
10:41
too Hood I'm too ghetto y'all told me
10:43
that all year but when other people do
10:46
it y'all don't say nothing so this and
10:49
Kaitlin Clark who was white had not
10:51
really faced any of that so there was
10:53
this sense of a double standard in the
10:55
coverage of this there was this real
10:57
momentum to kind of pit the two them
10:59
against each other as these two stars of
11:01
the sport one white one black and
11:04
Caitlyn Clark was not so interested in
11:06
any of that I don't think Angel should
11:07
be criticized at all and you know says
11:10
she has nothing but respect for Angel
11:11
Reese loves how she plays loves her game
11:14
competition is good I think everybody
11:16
knew there was going to be a little
11:17
Trash Talk in the entire tournament it's
11:18
not just me and Angel across any sport
11:20
that's how it should be so she says
11:23
trash talk all the time and why should
11:25
this be any different you know you
11:27
should be able to play with that emotion
11:28
that's how I'm going to continue to play
11:29
that's how every girl should continue to
11:31
play so and ultimately this becomes a
11:34
sort of long tale of the final itself
11:37
you had this moment with these
11:39
incredible ratings for the game and then
11:41
you had this kind of secondary moment of
11:44
this pseudo controversy and all of it is
11:47
drawing eyeballs to women's basketball
11:48
in a way that hadn't really happened in
11:50
the decades that had been around and
11:52
even for people who don't follow
11:54
basketball right I mean I had heard
11:55
about it around that time probably
11:57
precisely for that reason
The Postmortem
12:00
absolutely you had people who had never
12:02
watched Caitlin Clark play a minute of
12:03
basketball consuming the story in a new
12:06
way so really was this time last year
12:08
taking together the tournament
12:09
experience and this sort of postmortem
12:12
that kitlin Clark becomes more than a
12:13
basketball player she becomes a national
12:15
figure at a very different
12:16
[Music]
12:21
scale we'll be right
12:25
[Music]
12:28
back
Sponsorships
12:31
so Matt you just told me that Caitlyn
12:33
Clark at the end of last season really
12:35
went from being a basketball player in
12:37
the state of Iowa to something much
12:39
bigger something really on the national
12:41
stage tell me about that so see emerges
12:43
from last season with a whole new
12:44
profile a lot of new fans a lot of new
12:47
attention and in this sort of fluke of
12:49
historical timing Caitlyn Clark's
12:51
college career is coming along at a time
12:53
when there is this massive shift
12:54
happening in college sports prior to
12:57
2021 College athletes could not make
12:58
money off of their name image and
13:00
likeness now that's a possibility so
13:03
that combined with being an extremely
13:05
effective narrator of Her Own Story
13:07
she's becoming extremely famous in a
13:09
time when becoming extremely famous as a
13:11
college athlete is very lucrative
13:13
business so okay this translates to
13:16
sponsors and advertisers presumably they
13:18
come calling they do quite a few of them
13:21
Iowa was Caitlyn Clark now has her own
13:24
brand of cereal on high show so Clark is
13:26
the latest athlete to join Nike's lineup
13:29
she's among the sort of sponsors who
13:31
associate with professional
13:32
players shoot shoot okay I'll shoot
13:36
what's happening but I don't see any
13:38
hoop State Farm if we can draw 56,000
13:42
fans you can draw 57 Gatorade if I can
13:46
sign with
13:48
Gatorade you can
13:51
too but these are not you know local car
13:54
dealerships these are major national
13:56
this is not she's obviously huge in Iowa
13:58
but these are national Brands um who
14:00
come calling and who stay very much a
14:02
part of the
14:04
picture a six fo senior from
14:09
West number
14:11
22
14:13
G so by the time her senior season
14:15
starts for 23 24 I mean this thing is
14:18
off and running the first sellout in the
14:20
history of the women's program here at
14:22
Northwestern of course the big draw I
14:25
went to a couple of games both at home
14:27
and on the road been packed mostly the
14:29
entire day and that's because of this
14:31
line that formed here it is stretching I
14:33
I think I've heard about a quarter mile
14:35
around the building and and it's just a
14:37
rock concert everywhere let's go Kaitlyn
14:39
CL I got to be like Kaitlyn a lot of
14:42
kids with signs you know I want to be
14:45
like Kate they're wearing her Jersey he
14:47
definitely changed the game for the
14:48
better and even just changed the world
14:51
but so are you know a lot of like grown
14:52
men people are driving hours to see her
14:55
they're selling out Arenas over 52,000
14:58
TI tickets have been sold not a single
15:00
empty seat with crowds flocking to see
15:02
Iowa Hawkeyes star Caitlyn Clark
15:05
secondary ticket prices for resale are
15:07
going for like $400 $500 it's really
15:10
become kind of the hottest thing in town
15:12
and celebrities are going to IA City to
15:15
watch college basketball and there is
15:19
this really kind of breakthrough
15:22
cultural power and she knows this she
15:25
knows she's being uh consumed in this
15:27
way and and she'll file away little
15:32
scenes that she takes in there was a
15:33
game um at Iowa that I was at there was
15:36
this girl it was cute she was like
15:37
copying our stretching warming up so I
15:39
thought it was like adorable she was
15:40
doing like leg swing she noticed before
15:43
the game so she files that away they
15:45
play the game she plays great they
15:47
[Music]
15:48
win she goes up to the girl and gives
15:50
her the shoes that she had worn for the
15:52
game what is the little girl to she
15:55
actually I mean she's she's beaming that
15:57
that is probably the most special moment
16:00
that has ever happened you know
16:02
something easy I can make her day and
16:04
I'm sure she loved it so it was cool but
16:06
kin has sort of talked about that being
16:08
her experience as a fan at that age too
16:11
and it really keeps
16:12
going here comes Clark how will she go
16:15
for history there it
16:18
is she's essentially breaking a new
16:20
record every few games she has the most
16:22
points of anybody to ever play on the
16:24
women's side eventually it's the men's
16:27
record K
16:30
becomes the all time leading score in
16:32
major P
16:35
basketball either men or women nobody
16:37
has scored more points playing college
16:38
basketball in division one than Caitlyn
16:40
Clark wow it's quite something the
16:42
record she broke on the men's side was
16:43
held by Pete marovich um to whom she was
16:46
compared last year so it's a lot of
16:48
history that she's
Benefits
16:54
transcending and you see the sport
16:56
itself start to reap some of the
16:57
benefits of this new found detention the
17:00
television contract for the women's
17:02
tournament value the tournament at $65
17:04
million annually which was a manyfold
17:07
increase over the last contract there is
17:09
a sense that ratings will persist and
17:12
she's also not the only player in the
17:14
country right now getting a lot of
17:15
attention there are great players
17:17
throughout the college game including
17:18
Angel ree Juju Watkins who's a freshman
17:20
at USC who are really frankly bigger
17:23
Stars than any men's college basketball
17:25
player right now so this doesn't just
17:27
begin and end with Caitlyn and it won't
17:29
end for college sports when she leaves
17:31
obviously Caitlyn Clark will not be the
17:33
college basketball player forever but
17:34
she helped Drive attention to the sport
17:36
and there is a hope that it can sustain
17:38
itself after she's gone so this
The Choice
17:41
tremendously popular college player is
17:43
really kind of blowing up the sport
17:45
economically and culturally but as you
17:47
say she's not going to be in college
17:50
Forever at some point she's going to
17:51
graduate she will so she faces this
17:54
Choice um despite being a senior there
17:55
was this allowance given to athletes
17:58
during Co to stay for an extra year so
18:00
really all year she's faced this Choice
18:01
people have asked her about it
18:02
constantly will she go back to school
18:04
for a fif season or will she turn pro
18:06
but Matt why wouldn't she go pro I mean
18:09
isn't it every athlete's aspiration and
18:12
goal to go pro I mean she's getting a
18:14
ton of attention selling out stadiums
18:16
like why would going pro even be a
18:18
question yeah if she were a male College
The WNBA
18:20
athlete playing basketball this might be
18:22
a lot more straightforward the best
18:24
players in college on the men's side
18:26
tend to go pro at the first opportunity
18:28
there is money to be made there are
18:29
eyeballs in the NBA on the women's side
18:31
there is the WNBA the professional
18:33
basketball league for women and it's
18:35
just a very different thing you know
18:36
it's a league that has gotten far fewer
18:38
viewers than women's college basketball
18:40
it is a league that doesn't have the
18:43
attendance of the games that kin Clark
18:45
has been playing in at Iowa and for some
18:47
context there were more than 9 million
18:49
people almost 10 million people who
18:50
watched the national championship game
18:52
the Caitlin Clark played in last year in
18:54
the college tournament the WNBA finals
18:57
last year for the professional League
18:58
were viewed by under a million people so
19:01
we're talking about you know a fraction
19:03
a tenth so much less so much less and
19:05
you know cayin Clark is not making a
19:07
kind of formal salary as a player uh in
19:09
college but her stature does afford her
19:12
a kind of profile that has made the
19:14
sponsorships possible that has made her
19:15
earning potential pretty stratospheric
19:18
and it's hard to say if that will
19:19
translate in a league where the
19:22
viewership is not the same you know
19:24
being the biggest star in college
19:25
basketball at the moment affords you a
19:27
bigger platform than being the biggest
19:28
star in the
19:30
WNBA it's just not consumed in the same
19:33
way that college sports has been and why
19:35
is that mat I think there a couple
19:36
reasons there is this kind of tribal
19:38
quality to college sports fandom you
19:41
know you you go to a school you become a
19:43
fan of a school you live in an area you
19:44
become a fan of that
19:46
team the WNBA is such a young league
19:49
it's you know barely older than Caitlyn
19:50
Clark is there hasn't necessarily been
19:53
that same attachment formed to the teams
19:57
and despite a lot of really passionate
19:59
fans and some improvements in attention
20:02
over the years there was the Olympic
20:04
team having women's basketball in 1996
20:08
there was the onset of WNBA obviously
20:10
there have been moments with stars in
20:13
the league like Amaya Mo Diana terazzi
20:16
but it hasn't sustained in the way that
20:18
I think some might have hoped okay so
Lower salaries
20:21
far lower viewership I'm assuming that
20:23
that's translating into lower salaries
20:26
it does far lower salaries Kaitlin Clark
20:28
who's wiely expected to be the first
20:29
pick in the draft for the WNBA will make
20:32
about $75,000 in salary wow for rookie
20:35
season that's pretty low it's pretty low
20:37
particularly when you compare it to the
20:39
NBA the first pick last year makes about
20:41
$12 million this year and it just
20:43
accelerates on the veter in scale too so
20:45
you have like the very best players in
20:46
the wda making you know more than
20:49
$200,000 as the kind of ceiling but
20:52
we're talking about just a totally
20:53
different Stratosphere than the men's
20:54
game where you have all sorts of
20:56
contracts in the tens of millions per
20:58
per year Caitlin Clark's been compared
21:00
to Steph Curry in the NBA the incredible
21:03
shooter from Golden State he makes about
21:05
$50 million a year God that's a huge
21:08
differential huge differential so what
21:09
you've seen a lot of female players do
21:11
over the years is supplement that income
21:13
by playing abroad in other leagues
21:14
professionally this is why Britney
21:16
grinder was in Russia it's why players
21:17
have traveled internationally for many
21:19
years to try to make some of that money
21:22
that wasn't available to them in WNBA
21:23
salary some other way okay so Caitlyn
Why go pro
21:26
Clark had this decision to make Go Pro
21:29
or stay another year in her college team
21:32
what did she decide to do she decided to
21:34
go pro and I think there are a couple of
21:36
reasons for that I think there's a real
21:37
strong basketball case going back to
21:39
Iowa having that experience again maybe
21:42
she doesn't grow as a player in the same
21:43
way that she might to GoPro compete
21:46
against the best there's also the
21:47
sponsorship side she actually can you
21:49
know retain a lot of the sponsors that
21:51
she's had Gatorade sticking with her
21:52
Nike is going to be around and you know
21:55
I think there's a sense that she might
21:57
be the exception that changes things she
22:01
hopes that she is part of the you know
22:03
next generation of players who can draw
22:05
more eyeballs to that League who can
22:07
maybe over the long run raise salaries
22:09
bring sponsorship dollars to the pros
22:12
she also can't St in college forever she
22:13
can't be in Iowa until she's 40 so
22:15
essentially Caitlyn's bet here is that
22:18
she can take all of her Firepower that
22:21
she has right now and potentially
22:23
transform women's basketball but How
22:27
likely is that really matter
Data points
22:29
you know it's hard to know at this point
22:30
there are some data points so far that
22:32
are pretty encouraging if you're Caitlyn
22:34
Clark and the WNBA tickets are already
22:36
being sold ticket prices are up because
22:37
of the demand for games for the Indiana
22:39
Fever who have the first pick in the
22:42
professional draft coming up are
22:43
expected to take Caitlyn Clark so this
22:45
hasn't even happened yet she has not
22:46
been officially selected first and we're
22:48
already seeing ticket prices and ticket
22:50
sales spiking wow in anticipation for
22:52
Caitlin Clark showing up but I think
22:54
there is a sense that she is entering
22:57
the league on a different level of
22:59
stature with a different profile but
23:01
it's untested so Matt what does the
23:04
phenomenon of Caitlyn Clark tell us
23:07
about women's sports it tells us it's
Legacy
23:10
come a pretty long way you know in some
23:12
ways she's kind of the culmination of
23:15
this long Arc that dates to Title 9
23:17
which was you know legislation that
23:20
dictated that there could not be
23:21
discrimination on the basis of sex and
23:24
was applied widely to sports creating
23:25
opportunities for women and at the time
23:28
obviously this had to be legislated this
23:30
had to be mandated what is happening now
23:32
with Caitlyn Clark this is the free
23:34
market deciding that they're pretty
23:35
interested in women's sports you know
23:37
Sports is a business and there is a
23:39
strong business case as many sponsors
23:40
are deciding for themselves to watch
23:43
Caitlyn Clark to follow Caitlyn Clark
23:44
for leagues to want Caitlyn Clark in
23:47
their midst and then there's the sort of
23:48
broader cultural Point her coaches have
23:50
talked about just the role model she is
23:52
for tenacity and you know she was given
23:55
a technical foul last year after saying
23:57
damn it to her after she missed a shot
23:59
it's the sort of thing that would like
24:00
never be penalized in the men's game
24:02
they printed T-shirts that said damn it
24:03
and she posed with somebody like she has
24:05
owned the the kind of competitive streak
24:07
that men have been owning for so long
24:10
and I think modeling that beyond the
24:11
sort of business case is a real Legacy
24:13
that she's left yeah like don't judge me
24:16
differently right don't judge me
24:17
differently and you know her coach still
24:18
thinks that there is not as much
24:20
latitude given to to women athletes and
24:22
I think that's certainly true but it's
24:24
moved some I think there is certainly
24:27
more space given to that kind of
24:29
competitive fire and a female athlete
24:30
than there might have been even a few
24:31
years
24:32

24:37
ago Matt thank you very much thank you
24:40
very
24:45
much Iowa is scheduled to play on
24:48
Saturday it will be the first game of
24:51
the last tournament of Caitlyn Clark's
24:54
college
24:54
[Music]
24:57
career
25:00
we'll be right
25:11
back here's what else you should know
25:13
today Texas scored a fleeting win in its
25:16
fight with the Biden Administration over
25:18
a controversial immigration law that law
25:21
would allow Texas police to arrest
25:23
migrants Crossing into the US illegally
25:26
the administration argues that that
25:28
immigration policy and Foreign Affairs
25:31
are the purview of the federal
25:32
government but Texas argues the law is
25:35
authorized by a clause of the
25:37
Constitution that allows States in rare
25:40
circumstances to take action if they are
25:42
quote invaded an argument that a lower
25:45
court rejected in February on Tuesday a
25:49
US Supreme Court procedural ruling
25:51
briefly allowed the law to take effect
25:54
causing some confusion at the border
25:56
until an appeals court put the the law
25:58
back on
26:00
hold Texas will press its case for the
26:03
law in oral arguments before the fifth
26:05
Circuit Court of Appeals in early April
26:07
a decision to let the law take effect
26:10
would upset Decades of legal precedent
26:13
Texas governor Greg Abbott said that he
26:16
expects the constitutionality of the law
26:18
will eventually be decided by the
26:20
Supreme
26:21
