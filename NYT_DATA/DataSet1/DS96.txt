How Poisoned Applesauce Found Its Way to Kids


0:01
from The New York Times I'm Michael
0:02
babbaro this is the
0:05
[Music]
0:09
daily
0:10
today a times investigation has revealed
0:13
how applesauce leased with high levels
0:16
of lead which poisoned hundreds of
0:19
children across the US sailed through a
0:22
food safety system meant to protect
0:25
American
0:26
consumers I spoke with my colleague
0:29
Christina Jew about what she
0:32
[Music]
0:37
found it's Thursday February
0:42
29th Christina where does this story
0:45
start so last summer families All Over
0:50
America started to have sort of a
0:52
mysterious problem their kids had
0:55
startlingly high blood Le levels and
0:58
this is extremely alarming for all these
1:00
families because lead poisoning can lead
1:03
to behavior problems learning problems
1:07
developmental problems as well and
1:10
basically no one knows where this is
1:12
coming from our daughter loves makeup
1:15
and doing her nails
1:17
dresses and our son loves cars and
1:20
airplanes loud
1:22
exhaust and one of the families in this
1:24
situation is Nicole Peterson and Thomas
1:27
Young they have two little kids little
1:30
boy who's one and a daughter who's three
1:33
and our son had gone to his first annual
1:37
checkup and they did a finger prick and
1:40
his blood level is high and during their
1:43
routine pediatric visits for the summer
1:46
they learn that the kids have high blood
1:49
levels we're talking about triple to
1:52
quadruple the cdc's level of concern
1:56
basically wow it's kind of like a
1:58
nightmare right it was tough very tough
2:01
so that gets reported to the county the
2:03
health department sends out an
2:05
inspector he goes through their house
2:08
with sort of this lead x-ray gun and
2:11
he's shooting everything every pot pan
2:15
toys I open up the rice cooker you know
2:18
to literally test everything this is a a
2:21
5 hour process the door frame there was
2:24
some in there but there was no concern
2:26
because there was no chipping no wear it
2:28
was encapsulated is what he mentioned he
2:30
finds some lead in a doorway in the
2:32
basement he finds lead in a figurine
2:35
that's sort of a family heirloom some
2:38
antique birds that my grandmother had
2:40
given me you know but Out Of Reach
2:43
they're seasonal they don't the kids are
2:45
not putting them in their mouth none of
2:47
these things are what the kids are
2:49
touching or eating or or really playing
2:53
with at all so it was really sort of a
2:57
mystery right and then the kids are
3:00
screened again they get checked in the
3:02
middle of August and and their blood
3:04
level doubled the numbers have gone up
3:06
into the 20s and so now 24 yeah everyone
3:11
is of course very very concerned
3:14
freaking out they're saying that this
3:16
has never happened before in County
3:19
history that this is the first time that
3:21
they've seen this Thomas and I were not
3:23
sleeping we're not eating like this is
3:26
driving us crazy and tormenting us
3:30
so the family is freaking out the
3:32
parents get their levels tested and it's
3:35
normal so now they're really really
3:39
facing a mystery I mean what are the
3:41
kids exposed to that the parents are not
3:44
so the county goes out to the daycare
3:46
looks at everything there they spent a
3:48
few hours at the daycare and nothing
3:50
they didn't really have any answers um
3:53
they really didn't know where to guide
3:55
us or kind us us in the right direction
3:58
yeah
4:01
and then the parents start a food diary
4:04
we all eat the same food we don't eat
4:05
different food the kids don't get one
4:07
meal and we get another meal and so and
4:09
they realize that there's one thing that
4:11
the kids eat that they don't only thing
4:13
that they eat that we don't eat are
4:15
these pouches you and it's these foil
4:18
packets of cinnamon applesauce that the
4:21
family gives the kids as a routine snack
4:24
and they loved it they would devour it
4:26
and they would eat it on the playground
4:28
if they were just out in a bath you know
4:30
because right I mean every parent me
4:33
included gives their kids a pouch of
4:36
applesauce it is the universal food of
4:38
the American toddler exactly so what
4:41
happens once the family Narrows this
4:44
down to applesauce so the county health
4:48
inspector comes out they take samples of
4:52
the packets they take it to the State
4:54
Health lab in North Carolina and they
4:56
run some tests I think they on Friday
5:00
yeah they called us on a Friday and said
5:03
that they had gotten the report back
5:05
from the lab and that it had tested
5:08
positive and what they find is basically
5:11
an incredibly high level of lead in this
5:14
applesauce they forward that to the FDA
5:17
which quickly turns around and works
5:20
with the company that made it to issue a
5:23
recall it was just so nice to have like
5:25
a resolution like we know where this is
5:29
coming from now and we don't have to
5:30
drive ourselves crazy in this constant
5:33
nightmare it's nice to have an
5:38
answer and so millions of these packets
5:42
that were sold at Dollar Tree under the
5:44
name wabana and also it's Schnucks
5:47
Market and Weiss Market grocery stores
5:50
under the store brand those are all
5:53
recalled
5:56
wow and then the FDA tries to figure out
5:59
how this lead got into the applesauce in
6:02
the first place and what do they find so
6:05
they pretty quickly narrow in on the
6:08
cinnamon in the
6:09
applesauce there's this known problem in
6:12
the spice industry where sometimes
6:15
people will add lead chromate powder to
6:19
sort of make the color pop H and and
6:21
what is lead chromate Christina lead
6:24
chromate is an orange yellow powder it's
6:27
still used in industrial applications
6:29
overseas and even though it's toxic
6:32
sometimes people illegally add it to
6:35
spices especially with turmeric or curry
6:37
powder that sometimes this is poured in
6:40
to sort of bulk up the spices like a
6:43
drug dealer sort of cuts the cocaine
6:45
with flour or sugar or something H so
6:48
the FDA is realizing that could be what
6:52
was happening in Ecuador where this
6:54
applesauce was processed and officials
6:56
from Ecuador are able to trace the
6:58
cinnamon in the applesauce up the supply
7:02
chain to a spice grinder who they think
7:04
is
7:05
responsible got it so the
7:08
FDA suspects that somebody grinding
7:13
cinnamon is adding lead chromate to it
7:16
basically to make more money on the
7:20
production of that cinnamon exactly and
7:23
then it went to the company that made
7:25
the applesauce which shipped it off to
7:28
the US landed in the ports of Baltimore
7:31
and Miami and ended up right on grocery
7:34
shelves to be handed to American infants
7:37
and toddlers H and how many children
7:41
Christina ended up consuming this lead
7:46
poisoned
7:48
applesauce we know the kids in 44 States
7:51
had this applesauce mhm the CDC has said
7:56
that about 468 kids consume this app
7:59
applesauce and had high levels of lead
8:01
in their blood the median level of lead
8:05
in their blood was about six times
8:07
higher than what we saw with the Flint
8:10
lead and Water Crisis about a decade ago
8:13
wow yeah and as far as how many kids
8:16
total it could be so many more there's
8:19
probably plenty of parents who didn't
8:21
have a blood screening who didn't
8:23
connect it to the applesauce and there's
8:25
certainly others that didn't meet the
8:27
case definition by the time this was
8:29
discovered
8:30
which you know required a certain level
8:31
of lead in the blood okay so at the very
8:34
least nearly
8:37
500 very small children
8:40
were consuming this contaminated
8:43
applesauce and it's discovered that
8:45
their blood is filled with lead that's
8:49
the very best case scenario yeah this is
8:52
one of the worst toxic exposures of us
8:56
kids in decades and this Christina is
8:59
where you and the times come in right
9:04
that's right I cover the FDA which has a
9:07
big infrastructure to protect our food
9:11
supply and so I wanted to understand how
9:14
this occurred so I teamed up with
9:17
another reporter will Fitz Gibbon who
9:19
works for a nonprofit called the
9:21
examination it's a global Health news
9:24
organization and we wound up getting
9:26
thousands of pages of documents from
9:27
Ecuador tracing their
9:29
investigation and interviewed a number
9:32
of food safety experts to really figure
9:35
out how the system failed to
9:39
detect basically poisonous applesauce
9:42
going on to store shelves All Over
9:45
America right because ideally you
9:48
discover that applesauce is poisoned
9:51
with lead before it enters the food
9:54
supply system not after it's entered the
9:57
blood of little children
10:00
exactly one expert I talked to basically
10:02
said in this situation the kids were
10:04
like the canary and the coal mine which
10:06
is not what you want to see happen in a
10:09
country with a sophisticated food safety
10:12
[Music]
10:22
system we'll be right
10:24
[Music]
10:28
back
10:30
so once you all conduct this
10:32
investigation what do you find how did
10:35
our regulatory system allow this
10:38
applesauce to enter the US so in the US
10:42
the food safety system is pretty robust
10:45
there are boots on the ground in every
10:47
state routine inspections of food making
10:51
facilities and there's some precedent of
10:54
criminal prosecutions for big failures
10:57
so things like salmonella and Syria get
11:00
discovered pretty
11:01
routinely the biggest fears have always
11:04
been about food that comes from outside
11:06
the US right where we know less you know
11:10
there can be things added for financial
11:12
gain there can be pesticides we don't
11:14
allow in the US and these fears really
11:17
grow in the late 2000s with a scandal in
11:22
China it's all about the chemical
11:24
melamine it can make protein levels look
11:26
normal in quality test if milk has been
11:29
watered down to cheat consumers people
11:32
were adding this powder called melamine
11:35
to infant formula and Pet Food and what
11:39
it did was mimic protein powder but it
11:41
was also really toxic nervous parents
11:44
have Rush children the hospitals when it
11:46
was revealed baby formula was laced with
11:48
the industrial chemical Mel so six
11:51
babies died in China why didn't the
11:53
government test the formula more
11:55
carefully ask this mother hundreds of
11:57
thousands of babies overseas got sick
12:00
and dogs and cats all around America got
12:04
sick and also died it's a black eye for
12:07
China's leadership consumer confidence
12:09
in Chinese Goods is falling to an
12:11
all-time low I remember this really well
12:14
and it was seen as a wake-up call that
12:17
there are some really bad actors in the
12:19
world when it comes to food and food
12:22
safety that's right so that creates some
12:26
impetus to change the way the US
12:29
overseas food that's imported from
12:31
outside the US and that winds up sort of
12:34
coming together in 2011 with President
12:38
Obama signing the food safety
12:40
modernization act that does a number of
12:43
things one of them is to really try to
12:46
plug the holes in the system of imported
12:50
food that are meant to prevent really
12:52
what happened in China from happening
12:55
again in the
12:56
[Music]
12:57
US
13:02
and how does the new law Envision that
13:05
working well it does two big things one
13:08
is there would be more overseas
13:10
inspections of food making facilities so
13:14
the FDA would actually send people into
13:16
the food plants they would take a look
13:18
at all their processes their procedures
13:22
their test results how they're making
13:24
the food safer to come into the us and
13:28
that was actually supposed to reach a
13:29
level of 19,000 inspections like that
13:32
per year H so in short they wanted to
13:35
treat International inspections the way
13:38
that they treat domestic ones make sure
13:40
that there are a lot of them that
13:41
they're frequent and that they're likely
13:43
to catch things that's right the other
13:46
thing it does is it puts us import
13:49
companies companies that import food and
13:51
it essentially made them Guardians of
13:54
the food that comes in to the US and
13:58
they're not not really used to having
14:00
these food safety duties but here they
14:03
came anyway and so what they're supposed
14:05
to do is look at the food they're
14:08
importing identify the specific risks
14:11
related to that food and make sure those
14:14
are dealt with and oftentimes they do
14:18
this with consultants and they're
14:20
required to hire Auditors to make sure
14:24
they're doing a good job of basically
14:26
eliminating risks and sometimes these
14:29
Auditors go overseas and inspect the
14:32
facilities on their
14:33
behalf so on paper this looks like a
14:36
pretty tight ship something that can
14:39
keep the lead or the melamine out of the
14:43
US right and there's a redundancy at
14:45
play here from what you just said which
14:47
is the us is going to be sending out
14:49
inspectors itself to foreign food
14:51
manufacturing facilities and it's going
14:54
to be asking food importers to do their
14:58
own auditing of their suppliers so the
15:01
thinking I'm sure is that between those
15:03
two something will be caught clearly
15:06
though that didn't happen in the case of
15:09
the applesauce so what did you learn
15:11
about why that is so the law didn't
15:16
quite work out as intended the number of
15:19
overseas inspections was supposed to
15:21
reach
15:22
19,000 well that didn't come to pass
15:25
last year there were 1,200 inspections
15:29
and so that means FDA inspectors got to
15:31
about 1% of the overseas food facilities
15:35
wow a tiny percentage oh yeah yeah and
15:39
when it came to the company in Ecuador
15:41
that made this applesauce company's
15:44
called Ostro food we found that the FDA
15:47
hadn't been in that facility since
15:50
2019 and when they were there we don't
15:53
think at the time they were using
15:56
cinnamon and overall the FDA didn't find
15:59
any problems that they recommended
16:01
fixing so I really want to pause on this
16:05
no one from the United States government
16:07
despite the Ambitions of this law had
16:10
visited the facility where this
16:11
applesauce was made in the last five
16:15
years so if there were any problems with
16:17
any product leaving those facilities and
16:20
headed for the US the US government had
16:22
no eyes and no ears on any of it not on
16:26
site no and when we took a look at the
16:29
second line of defense that's supposed
16:30
to keep things like toxic applesauce out
16:33
of the US the importers we found out
16:37
thousands of them just never set up
16:39
programs to vet foreign food wow so they
16:42
hadn't taken up this Guardian role that
16:43
the government was trying to give them
16:46
in fact the FDA has issued about 3,400
16:48
citations to companies that weren't
16:51
doing this at all huh so in this
16:54
situation with the importers no one
16:56
would tell us exactly what happened with
16:58
the
16:59
applesauce but basically what we could
17:01
piece together is that there was an
17:03
auditor sent out to the applesauce
17:06
making company in Ecuador late last year
17:09
and when they took a look around they
17:11
wound up giving this company a grade of
17:13
A+ even as there are headlines all
17:16
across the United States about kids
17:19
being poisoned by lead tainted
17:21
applesauce H so in the case of the
17:23
applesauce you're saying the auditor
17:26
working on behalf of an importer
17:28
whose job it is now to protect us
17:31
consumers ends up issuing a pretty much
17:34
perfect rating to the maker of this
17:37
applesauce even though of course we know
17:40
that the applesauce is contaminated
17:42
suggesting that that auditor was clearly
17:46
not doing their job very well right and
17:49
a lot of the experts we talked to said
17:50
this is kind of an honor System and when
17:53
they say that they're talking about the
17:55
fact that all these companies have the
17:58
discretion to choose which risks to
18:00
worry about in this case with this audit
18:03
it looks like the concern was salmonella
18:06
so this lead that's widespread well
18:09
known at this point was a non- concern
18:12
as far as that audit went Christina I'm
18:15
curious in this American System what
18:17
you've described so far are the
18:19
responsibilities of
18:22
inspections overseas whether that's done
18:24
by the FDA at a manufacturing site or by
18:27
an reporter who's supposed to hire an
18:29
auditor to go to the
18:31
facility but once International Food
18:34
reaches the US is there ever a moment
18:37
where the American system kicks in and
18:40
tests food opens up a package or a pouch
18:43
of apples sauce and tests it you know
18:47
there is there are tests that occur at
18:50
the border at the ports of entry and the
18:53
inspectors will open up you know a pouch
18:55
of applesauce and test it but the number
18:59
of these tests has actually gone down
19:01
it's really fallen in half over the last
19:04
decade and at the same time the number
19:06
of imported food products has gone way
19:09
up it's really at an all-time high just
19:11
down a hair from where it was in
19:14
2022 so in essence the Border searches
19:17
those are really like looking for a
19:20
needle in a hay stack mhm based on your
19:23
reporting I wonder if you have concluded
19:26
that what happened here is the fault of
19:29
a poorly constructed law or it's lack
19:33
enforcement or if this is just the
19:37
reality that in a global food supply
19:41
chain with so many elements and
19:44
manufacturers and
19:46
Facilities that it's just going to be
19:48
hard to
19:50
detect something like a malevolent
19:54
cinnamon supplier you know who adds a
19:57
terrible toxin to
20:00
food I mean yeah I think in the best of
20:03
systems it's easy to Envision how
20:06
something could slip through but this is
20:10
such a close parallel to what our nation
20:13
really grappled with almost 15 years ago
20:17
in creating this new system of
20:19
inspections and Audits and what our
20:22
investigation found really was that the
20:24
system's not living up to those
20:26
requirements at all the inspections
20:29
aren't anywhere close to where they were
20:31
envisioned to be the audits that were
20:34
supposed to be happening in many cases
20:37
aren't happening at all right you're
20:40
saying even the best of systems might
20:41
not catch something but we don't have
20:43
the best of systems we don't even have
20:45
the system that the law requires exactly
20:49
so I want to return to the family that
20:51
we met at the start of this
20:53
conversation how worried are they about
20:57
what this Leed poisoning will mean for
21:01
those two very small children and what
21:04
do we understand to be the prognosis for
21:07
those two
21:08
kids well for all the families the
21:11
concern is that lead lives in the body
21:14
forever it's in the bones and your kid
21:18
has a growth spurt and some of that lead
21:20
can come out there are different you
21:22
know junctures in your life where the
21:24
lead can come out so there are lifelong
21:27
ramification
21:29
and for Nicole and Thomas the family we
21:32
met from North
21:34
Carolina the health system takes this
21:36
very seriously so they've been provided
21:39
with nutritional counseling they've been
21:41
provided with Specialists to help the
21:43
kids meet their developmental
21:45
Milestones but there is a sense that
21:48
things will never be quite the same for
21:52
them they can't just walk into the
21:54
grocery store toss things into the cart
21:57
blly
21:58
without having a second thought after
22:01
what happened to their young
22:03
children there will be a lingering sense
22:05
I would imagine that the system really
22:07
did fail
22:10
[Music]
22:13
them well Christina thank you very
22:16
