It Sucks to Be 33



0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael babo
0:03
this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:09
daily today a massive microgeneration of
0:13
babies born in the early 1990s have
0:16
ended up in a lifelong competition for
0:19
everything that is shaping both their
0:22
lives and the entire US economy for
0:26
better or worse my colleague Gina smik
0:30
is one of
0:31
[Music]
0:36
[Applause]
0:41
them it's Thursday March
0:45
[Music]
0:50
14th hi Gina hi Michael how's it going
0:53
it's going all right I'm excited for
0:55
this conversation about you about PE
0:58
millennials
1:01
so we usually come to you to talk about
1:04
the biggest Trends in the US economy we
1:06
talk to you about what the Federal
1:07
Reserve is up to interest rates being
1:10
raised interest rates being lowered the
1:12
state of inflation but today is
1:14
different as as I'm hinting at this is
1:15
going to be a conversation focused on
1:19
you and people like you oh man makes me
1:23
sound like a narcissist which I guess is
1:24
somewhat
1:26
appropriate well so just tell us how you
1:28
came to this yeah so I am an economics
1:31
reporter and I've always been interested
1:32
in demographics and because I've been
1:35
covering economics for you know over a
1:37
decade at this point one thing that I've
1:39
consistently noticed is that every time
1:41
I make a really big life decision it
1:44
seems like a huge portion of the US
1:47
economy has been making that decision
1:50
right along with me basically at the
1:51
exact same time so for a couple of
1:54
concrete examples here the year I bought
1:56
a house the housing market just went
1:58
absolutely crazy when I rented my first
2:01
apartment rental prices in the city that
2:03
I was living in were going up very
2:05
sharply when I got married the wedding
2:07
industry was having this incredible year
2:08
like the strongest year in a generation
2:10
isn't that pretty normal because when
2:12
you're in a certain stage of Life lots
2:14
of people are doing the exact same thing
2:16
I mean isn't that very typical no so
2:18
what I'm talking about here is something
2:20
a little bit different I'm not talking
2:22
about within my friend group it seemed
2:23
like everyone was doing the same thing
2:25
I'm talking about in the actual
2:27
statistics everyone was doing the same
2:30
you know I was looking at the enti
2:32
economy and realizing that I was kind of
2:34
being like the statistical agent like I
2:36
was theal in the economy as I went
2:39
through it and I realized that that's
2:41
actually because I'm part of this really
2:43
important cohort of people born in 1990
2:46
and 1991 who are turning 33 or 34 this
2:49
year and we actually represent the
2:51
biggest part of the biggest generation
2:54
in the United States just say that one
2:55
more time I mean that feels like a
2:58
genuinely new piece of information I
2:59
just want you to repeat so I can absorb
3:01
it yes so we are the biggest part of the
3:04
biggest living generation in America the
3:06
people who were born in 1990 and 1991
3:09
are the two biggest population years in
3:11
the country if you look at it on a chart
3:13
you get a little Peak right over 1990
3:15
and 1991 and that means that the
3:17
millennial generation is sort of skewed
3:19
towards people who are now in their
3:20
early 30s this population group if you
3:23
add 1990 and 1991 together is about 9.5
3:27
million people so a pretty large group
3:30
of Americans fascinating and what was it
3:34
about 1990 and 1991 that
3:37
explains that what was in the water so
3:40
to speak these were two really big birth
3:42
years a lot of babies were born in 1990
3:45
and 1991 in the United States partially
3:48
because some of these folks are the
3:49
children of the big years of the baby
3:52
boo H it was also more than just birth
3:55
we had quite a bit of immigration that
3:57
added to this generation you know both
3:59
in the 199 s and the 2000s I think some
4:01
of sort of the dream kids and then also
4:04
some young adults in the time since have
4:07
really added to this generation and so
4:08
that combination of immigrants and
4:11
natural population growth has
4:13
contributed to make these two years
4:15
really the biggest population years at
4:16
the moment so Gina when you had that
4:18
Sensation that when you zigged everyone
4:21
around you was zigging and when you
4:22
zagged everyone around you was zagging
4:24
it's because to a certain degree it's
4:26
true this huge part of the population
4:29
was was mimicking what you were doing
4:32
because there are so many of you right
4:35
okay so stepping back what does it mean
4:37
for you and for the economy that this
4:42
cohort is so large well economics is all
4:47
about demand and Supply right and so
4:50
what this has meant for the cohort which
4:52
I call Peak Millennials you can use
4:53
whichever word you prefer is that at
4:55
every stage of our economic lives we've
4:57
created a lot of demand which the
4:59
economy has then had to try to keep up
5:02
with the metaphor that I use which our
5:05
colleague and your frequent guest Ben
5:06
Castleman helped me come up with is that
5:09
this group of people you know my
5:10
generation have moved through the
5:12
economy sort of like a person squeezing
5:14
into a too small sweater H and what does
5:17
it look like to try as a cohort to
5:21
squeeze into a sweater that is too small
5:24
it means that you know right at the
5:25
outset it's a little bit uncomfortable
5:27
because you're kind of stretching the
5:28
sweater out as you get it on
5:30
and then it means that eventually you
5:31
leave the sweater a little bit stretched
5:33
out a little bit flabby and so the
5:35
reason that I got interested in this as
5:37
it relates to Millennials is that we're
5:40
sort of at this critical juncture and
5:42
squeezing the sweater
5:43
on these folks are now in the age range
5:46
where they're making really big economic
5:48
decisions whether that's buying a house
5:49
or having kids right and that's really
5:52
important for the peak Millennials
5:53
obviously but because they're such a big
5:56
generation or such a big sub generation
5:58
it's also potentially pretty influential
6:00
for the broader United States
6:05
economy so I think to really understand
6:08
what you're talking about it would help
6:11
us to understand what the impact on the
6:14
economy has been so far as Peak
6:18
Millennials have tried to fit into this
6:20
metaphorical sweater so where Gina do
6:24
you think we should
6:25
start you know I think there are
6:27
probably three areas where we can see
6:29
this most clearly I think the first one
6:32
and a good place to start is college the
6:35
second is the labor market and then the
6:37
third is housing so let's start with
6:39
Peak Millennials entering college so
6:42
when my cohort went off to college we
6:44
really stretched the existing system so
6:47
rewind this is 2008 and 2009 the Great
6:51
Recession is just hit so unemployment is
6:53
shooting up and we're seeing even older
6:55
people shelter in colleges and
6:57
universities to sort of waight out that
6:59
re session MH at the same time these
7:01
Peak Millennials are coming in and we're
7:03
this huge generation of people and so
7:06
between all of that population and the
7:08
fact that people are enrolling in
7:09
college anyway enrollment just shoots up
7:12
institutions that had previously been
7:14
able to welcome anybody needed to start
7:15
turning applicants away you get stories
7:18
about colleges expanding in this period
7:20
And so just in general the system is
7:22
really sort of trying to accept all of
7:24
these very many
7:26
applicants then this generation
7:28
graduates and in recent years you've
7:31
actually seen Schools starting to close
7:33
or merge because they're no longer
7:34
serving this massive cohort in some
7:36
places that's because there's been this
7:38
cultural shift away from college but in
7:40
many places it's also about demographics
7:43
so Peak Millennials are such an enormous
7:46
force in higher education in this period
7:48
that higher education literally expands
7:51
in some cases and then contracts when
7:54
Peak Millennials finish moving through
7:56
them they absolutely contribute to that
7:59
trend and then they also have this
8:00
really interesting impact when it comes
8:02
to student debt so again rewind to 2008
8:06
2009 the job Market's not great people
8:08
are going back to school or staying in
8:09
school longer and this is also the era
8:12
of for-profit colleges which took in a
8:14
lot of students and left them with sort
8:16
of sometimes dubious credentials but a
8:17
lot of student loans and what all of
8:20
this means taken together is that a very
8:22
big number of people in this very big
8:24
age group end up taking out student debt
8:26
and student debt actually surpasses
8:28
credit card debt as the biggest source
8:30
of debt outside of mortgages during the
8:32
years that this microgeneration is in
8:34
college so a refuge from a bad economy
8:37
doesn't feel like a refuge for a lot of
8:39
peak Millennials because they're
8:40
accumulating so much debt and what I
8:43
guess you're about to tell me is that
8:45
because they're entering the economy in
8:46
the middle of the Great Recession the
8:48
job market is also pretty tricky right
8:52
so the people who don't finish college
8:53
enter into a very difficult labor market
8:55
sort of in the depths of the Great
8:57
Recession the people who do finish
8:58
college and graduate in say 2012 or 2013
9:01
or somewhere in that neighborhood are
9:03
still graduating into a pretty
9:05
historically weak labor market because
9:07
as you probably remember Michael it was
9:09
a very long drawn out recovery from that
9:11
very deep recession and so what we get
9:14
is the era of Baristas with Bachelor
9:16
degrees you know everybody is talking
9:18
about the fact that employers sort of
9:20
have their pick of the litter when it
9:22
comes to entry-level employees which
9:24
they do based on the scale of peak
9:25
Millennials right yeah there are a ton
9:27
of them and the job market is weak and
9:29
so there really is a very tough entry
9:31
into the labor market for these people
9:33
one that is probably at least at the
9:35
margin exacerbated by just how big the
9:37
cohort of people is and so what we see
9:40
when we look back on this era is that
9:42
some Millennials and particularly those
9:44
who hadn't finished their college
9:45
degrees found that they were earning
9:47
less than previous groups had at the
9:50
same age right when they entered the
9:51
labor market we also see that because
9:54
student debt had shot up so much that
9:56
student debt to starting salary as sort
9:58
of a ratio really shot up during this
9:59
period which meant that it could be
10:01
harder for these folks to build wealth
10:03
right they're earning less they owe more
10:06
thus their ability to do big Financial
10:09
things is just going to suffer which I
10:11
think of course brings us to housing
10:14
right so we've been steadily seeing this
10:17
uptick in the age at which people start
10:19
to get into the housing market to cite a
10:22
statistic that I think illustrates this
10:24
the median age of firsttime home buyers
10:27
has climbed from something like 31 and
10:29
2013 to about 35 in 2023 so it's just
10:33
really been moving up over this period
10:35
four years that's a big leap in what
10:38
should be an average that is very hard
10:41
to move yes and part of this is again
10:44
bad timing a lot of these Peak
10:45
Millennials were coming into our 30s
10:47
sort of in the wake of the pandemic you
10:50
know at a time when housing prices
10:52
climbed really really rapidly and then
10:54
interest rates starting in 2022 began to
10:57
really take off and so that combination
10:59
of much higher interest rates and very
11:01
high home prices has meant that
11:02
affordability has just been really
11:04
difficult at the exact moment that the
11:06
peak of the millennial generation began
11:08
to look to buy okay so in short the
11:12
story that you are telling here about
11:13
this cohort your
11:15
cohort is that at the exact moment where
11:19
they need or want something in this
11:22
economy a college degree a first job a
11:25
house and when it financially speaking
11:29
should make sense for them to want it
11:31
and get it the sheer scale of the cohort
11:36
combined with some very powerful
11:38
external economic forces like the Great
11:40
Recession or a housing crunch High
11:43
interest rates means that demand becomes
11:46
so great that the thing this cohort
11:49
wants becomes incredibly hard to get
11:52
that is the unique burden of being part
11:54
of this peak Millennial group you all
11:57
are essentially crowding each other out
12:01
yes so a lot of this is timing obviously
12:04
but it does seem that at least on the
12:05
margin it can be that we eat each
12:07
other's economic lunch and what that
12:09
means is we've seen these big delays
12:11
among this cohort and making big
12:13
decisions as compared to Generations
12:15
they came before and so that when people
12:18
joke that we Millennials complain a lot
12:20
who would joke that people do people do
12:23
Michael and the reality is that the
12:25
complaining reflects something
12:28
real so many people in this age group
12:30
feel that at every turn of our economic
12:32
lives our generation has been behind and
12:36
now we're playing
12:43
ketchup we'll be right
12:49
back so J I want to understand the
12:51
long-term implications of this
12:53
demographic reality that you have been
12:55
describing what is it going to mean for
12:57
Peak Millennials and for the rest of the
12:58
economy
12:59
that your cohort is in the middle of
13:02
this fierce battle for resources and
13:05
have been so delayed in so many economic
13:07
areas of life so I think there are a few
13:10
ways to think about this but I actually
13:13
over the course of my reporting met this
13:15
man who is in this age group he's 33 and
13:18
I think he's kind of this perfect
13:20
encapsulation of some of the trends that
13:22
we're talking about here and some of the
13:24
consequences that result from them okay
13:26
so his name is Thomas Stiller he grew up
13:28
in Eerie Pennsylvania in a pretty middle
13:31
class family his dad was a teacher and
13:32
his mom was a nurse and as he's moved
13:35
through adulthood he struggled to
13:36
achieve that middle class lifestyle
13:38
himself he's got a master's degree in
13:40
medical social work but he also has
13:42
student loans as a result of that and
13:43
that's left him sort of struggling
13:45
financially to pay that off and save
13:47
money so he currently Works two jobs and
13:50
at one point he even took on a third at
13:51
a Wendy's drive-thru MH and still you
13:54
know he and his wife are struggling to
13:56
buy up a house they're struggling to
13:58
move some where before they start a
14:00
family and so they've really had to push
14:02
back the timeline a little bit and it's
14:03
meant that their dreams of you know
14:04
buying a house and then eventually
14:06
having kids are basically on hold for
14:07
now which is a very Vivid consequence
14:10
and a very Vivid long-term consequence
14:13
of these delays how typical is that of
14:18
peak Millennials that this set of
14:20
economic delays you have been describing
14:23
lead to a decision not to have a family
14:28
yeah well we have very clearly seen is
14:30
that fertility Trends have been very low
14:33
for the generation you know we have not
14:36
had a lot of childbearing among
14:38
Millennial women and sort of the age at
14:40
first child birth has been going
14:42
steadily up and so I think there's a
14:44
question of whether that's going to
14:45
change but for now what we've seen is is
14:47
not a lot of childbearing among this
14:49
group and talk to us about why that is
14:52
going to matter in the broader
14:54
economy so it matters for a whole bunch
14:57
of reasons you know when they're are
14:59
fewer children there are fewer people in
15:00
the economy which obviously affects the
15:03
size of the economy just in a very
15:05
mathematical way you know kids involve a
15:07
lot of spending people in general
15:08
involve a lot of spending they add to
15:10
growth and then I think later on there
15:12
are really serious potential
15:14
consequences because this will impact
15:16
what the retirement system looks like
15:18
for all of us fewer kids today means
15:20
fewer adults in a few you know decades
15:23
paying into the social security system
15:25
which means that we are obviously going
15:28
to have a lot of peak Millennials who
15:30
are retiring at a time when there are
15:32
fewer people to sort of pay into the
15:34
system that will fund that retirement
15:36
right so the reality of peak Millennials
15:38
delaying having kids is a genuine
15:41
Financial strain on the government
15:44
especially it's cherished safety net for
15:48
retirees absolutely okay so how else
15:52
should we be thinking about the
15:53
long-term impacts of all of this so
15:57
there is research from back when the
15:59
Baby Boomers were the biggest generation
16:02
into how being such a large generation
16:04
can affect long-term economic health so
16:07
we know from the late Boomers so the
16:08
people who were born in the late 1950s
16:10
and early 1960s that really big sub
16:13
generation that people who entered the
16:15
labor market in that generation who
16:17
joined sort of a weak job market and
16:19
then had a lot of competition
16:21
experienced some pretty bad long-term
16:23
consequences from that we saw them have
16:24
a lot of financial strain we saw them
16:27
having elevated levels of homelessness
16:29
and those problems really followed them
16:30
for a number of years after they entered
16:32
the job market and I asked a lot of
16:34
economists about this I said you know
16:36
are these baby boomers or these late
16:38
Boomers the prototype for Millennials
16:41
and I think this is the one place in the
16:42
story where we actually run into a
16:44
silver lining um which is that Economist
16:46
and demographers told me that the
16:48
Millennials are probably better off than
16:50
those late baby boomers because while
16:52
the generations are actually kind of
16:53
similar in size Millennials are actually
16:55
a little bit bigger what you see is that
16:57
those Boomers represented a huge jump in
17:00
size relative to the generation that had
17:02
come just before whereas Millennials
17:04
represent a jump in size relative to the
17:06
generation just before but not as big of
17:08
a jump and so it's that differential
17:10
that matters it's how much the sweater
17:12
has to stretch relative to how big it is
17:14
you know in the Boomer's case it went
17:16
from being an extra small fitting onto a
17:17
giant and in the Millennials case it
17:19
went from being an extra large and had
17:21
to fit onto a giant and so I think that
17:23
that size differential has been really
17:25
really important and so what Economist
17:28
will tell you is that there are some
17:30
reasons to hope that while Millennials
17:32
are clearly doing things later while
17:34
there has obviously been Financial
17:35
strain caused by sort of timing also
17:38
potentially generational size
17:40
Millennials might end up okay in the end
17:43
you know we are seeing these folks
17:45
managed to build wealth you know it's
17:47
taken them a while but in in recent
17:48
years we've seen them really start to
17:50
amass wealth in stocks wealth in
17:51
retirement accounts we're seeing them
17:53
have very low unemployment rates you
17:55
know there are signs that these folks
17:57
are finally finding their footing in in
17:59
the labor market and in the economy as a
18:00
whole so I think you know again it Bears
18:03
reiterating that this generation has
18:05
been very delayed in a lot of economic
18:07
developments but the late is not
18:09
necessarily entirely derailed right but
18:12
in the meantime this cohort will still
18:15
be delayed in marching through the
18:17
economy and as it uncomfortably
18:19
stretches out the sweater the metaphor
18:21
we've been beating to death in this
18:23
episode and I wonder what that's going
18:25
to mean for the rest of us those of was
18:29
not in Peak Millennial or perhaps even
18:32
at all millennial generation you know in
18:35
some ways there are positives here in
18:37
the labor market for example the latter
18:39
part of gen z may actually benefit from
18:42
having such a comparatively small
18:43
graduating class so when they get to the
18:46
point that they're replacing these
18:47
Millennials this very big generation
18:50
they'll actually be coming into a
18:51
situation where the sweater is a little
18:53
bit roomier than it previously was and
18:55
so they could actually benefit in the
18:56
labor market from that the people coming
18:58
up behind Peak Millennials are going to
19:00
have more opportunity because Peak
19:01
Millennials were so big a couple of
19:03
economists suggested that to me yeah I
19:05
think there's also another really big
19:07
negative one for that demographic though
19:09
which is that they're going to be
19:10
competing with Millennials in the
19:12
housing market so just given the sheer
19:14
generational numbers we know that these
19:16
folks these Millennials in particular
19:18
the peak Millennials are going to be
19:20
competing for entrylevel homes for
19:22
pretty much years to come and so I think
19:25
what we see from analyses from
19:27
economists and from the government
19:29
is the demand for entry level single
19:31
family homes is likely to remain really
19:33
high for basically the rest of the
19:34
decade as a result so a lot of
19:36
competition in the housing market and
19:39
then you know as with all things I think
19:40
there's probably a political Dimension
19:42
to this you know I think that I I talked
19:45
to a lot of people anecdotally for this
19:47
story it wasn't wasn't just a data
19:49
reporting project and when you talk to
19:51
people in this generation you will often
19:52
hear that they feel a little bit
19:54
disillusioned by how this has played out
19:56
you know they don't feel great about the
19:57
fact they strling to hit some of those
19:59
sort of Financial and economic
20:01
Milestones that people in our parents
20:03
generation for example hit at much
20:05
earlier stages right or earlier years
20:08
and so you know to return to the man
20:10
that I had quoted earlier Thomas Stiller
20:12
from Pennsylvania you know he was
20:13
telling me that he just feels like
20:16
something has kind of gone wrong and he
20:17
actually told me that he blames
20:18
capitalism he feels like we're in the
20:21
system where wealth and the means of
20:22
obtaining it have become really
20:24
concentrated and few hands and he was
20:26
telling me that he's actually always
20:27
been a Democrat but he just doesn't even
20:30
know that he can votee for anyone in
20:31
this election and there's this real
20:33
sense of disillusionment and so I think
20:35
there's you know the both the Practical
20:37
consequences but then also sort of these
20:39
like less economic but more sociological
20:42
potential points of Fallout from the
20:44
size of this generation right what you
20:46
just said very much Jes with polling
20:48
we've seen over the past few months from
20:50
the times and elsewhere showing that
20:52
younger Americans are drifting away
20:56
especially from President Biden
20:59
because they don't think the system is
21:02
working and it seems like this fellow
21:05
you talk to very much reinforces that
21:07
through his own very frustrating
21:10
experiences in the economy yeah I think
21:13
that's the case and I think it it was
21:15
really interesting to me while reporting
21:16
this story to hear some of those
21:18
frustrations echoed over and over again
21:21
so Gina this of course all started with
21:23
you wanting to better understand your
21:26
own demographic you are Peak Millennial
21:30
so now that you've done all this
21:32
reporting talk to all these people how
21:34
are you thinking about what it means to
21:38
be a member of this group do you feel
21:42
like you better understand yourself now
21:45
and what is that
21:48
understanding you know I think growing
21:50
up in this generation you read so many
21:52
think pieces about the many things that
21:55
Millennials were accused of killing and
21:57
I think you watched a lot of TV segments
21:59
about how we weren't buying houses
22:01
because we were busy eating avocado
22:03
toast and I think a lot of the tone was
22:06
that there was maybe something wrong
22:07
with us you know that we had somehow
22:09
gone ay or made some bad choices and
22:12
that that was having an after effect in
22:14
our economic
22:16
lives and I think that sort of all of
22:19
that Fierce attention and and all of
22:21
that focus on this generation happened
22:24
because of our sheer size and also the
22:27
timing with which we hit at these really
22:29
important junctures in the economy where
22:30
we sort of exacerbated some challenges
22:32
that already
22:33
existed and so put very simply I think
22:36
we kind of are the problem but it's not
22:39
our
22:39
[Music]
22:47
fault well Gina thank you very much we
22:50
appreciate it thank you for having
22:57
me
23:07
we'll be right
23:17
back here's what else you need to
23:20
another day this week John Barnett a
23:23
former quality manager at Boeing who
23:25
accused the company of engaging in
23:27
unsafe manufacturing practices on its
23:30
passenger planes was found dead with
23:33
what appeared to be a self-inflicted
23:35
gunshot
23:36
wound we talked with Barnett who went by
23:39
the nickname swampy in 2019 Boeing was
23:43
the place I mean they were the place to
23:45
work you know speaking to my colleague
23:48
Natalie KF Barnett recounted how his
23:51
original Pride at being a Boeing worker
23:54
had turned into disillusionment and oh
23:57
my God I it was amazing when I put that
24:01
boing shirt on how my chest puffed out
24:05
you know I'd walk into the store around
24:07
here and they're like oh you are for
24:09
boing that is is awesome and thank y'all
24:12
so much and you're just mean so much to
24:14
this area you know wow and it was just
24:17
awesome and it's
24:19
[Music]
24:23
just we don't have that anymore here
24:26
Barnett said he felt obligated to become
24:28
a whistleblower after witnessing what he
24:30
described as rushed and shoddy work at
24:33
the Boeing factory in Charleston South
24:36
Carolina where he worked claims that
24:38
Boeing disputes I just think it's
24:42
critically important that the activities
24:45
going on within boing are made aware to
24:48
the people whose lives could be affected
24:50
you know is a quality manager at Boeing
24:54
you're the last line of defense before a
24:58
defect makes it out to the Flying public
25:01
that's a huge responsibility to many
25:04
Barnett's accusations which began in
25:06
2017 now seem pre safety problems have
25:10
plagued Boeing ever since including the
25:13
crash of two Boeing 737s in 2018 and
25:17
2019 and the blowout of a fuselage panel
25:20
on an Alaska Airlines flight 2 months
25:23
ago Barnett died in Charleston on
25:26
Saturday he was scheduled to finish a
25:29
deposition that day for a lawsuit in
25:31
which he accused Boeing of retaliating
25:34
against him for becoming a
25:39
whistleblower today's episode was
