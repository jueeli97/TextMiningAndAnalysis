Trump’s Plan to Take Away Biden’s Biggest Advantage



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Michael
0:02
borro this is the
0:05
[Music]
0:11
daily over the past week Donald Trump
0:14
has systematically dismantled the
0:16
Republican National Committee my
0:19
colleague Shane goldmacher reports that
0:22
in doing so Trump is trying to take away
0:25
President Biden's single biggest
0:27
advantage in this year's president
0:31
[Music]
0:37
centu it's Tuesday March
0:43
19th Shane can you just describe what
0:45
has been happening over at the
0:47
headquarters of the Republican National
0:50
Committee I mean it's been a gutting I
0:53
think in a period of about 10 days the
0:56
party has gone through really almost
0:59
unpre eded turmoil entering a general
1:03
election Fox News Alert the New York
1:06
Times is reporting tonight that RNC
1:08
chairwoman R McDaniel is set to step
1:10
down from a role it starts with the
1:13
former chairwoman of the party R
1:15
McDaniel McDaniel released this
1:17
statement quote it has been the honor
1:19
and privilege of my life to serve the
1:20
Republican National Committee stepping
1:22
down now I'm stepping aside today
1:24
because I have long promised to put the
1:27
nominee and their plans for the RNC
1:29
first because she's faced pressure and
1:31
unhappiness from Donald Trump to stay
1:33
his chair Trump then chose the head of
1:35
North Carolina's Republican party
1:37
Michael Watley to take McDaniel's place
1:39
it continues with Trump picking his hand
1:42
selected pick for who he wants to run
1:43
the party Michael Watley is the new
1:46
official RNC chairman here just 8 months
1:49
from the general election Watley
1:51
chairman of the North Carolina
1:52
Republican party is a strong Trump Ally
1:55
which includes his daughter-in-law Laura
1:57
Trump Trump's daughter-in-law Laura
1:59
Trump also named RNC co-chair who's now
2:02
been elected as the co-chair of the
2:03
Republican party to be honest with you
2:05
it's not a job that I ever wanted or a
2:07
job that I ever really thought I would
2:09
pursue but I also never thought that our
2:11
country would be in such Dire Straits
2:13
and and we truly are I think in the
2:16
first real full day that the Trump team
2:18
has keys the headquarters in Washington
2:21
DC they arrive with mass layoffs wide
2:25
layoffs and they really uh go farther I
2:28
think than many people at the arm and
2:30
see were expected were told more than 60
2:33
people were either fired or told that
2:36
they no longer had their job they had to
2:38
reapply to keep their job in a single
2:40
day that blindsided some longtime RNC
2:43
staff one of whom told reporters gutting
2:45
a committee just before the election
2:47
seems insane these layoffs just to put
2:49
it in perspective is something like
2:51
nearly a third of the total staff that
2:53
the party has is around 200 people are
2:55
on the payroll and about 60 got this
2:58
kind of a message political now
2:59
describing it as less a shakeup more a
3:01
blood bath and it's not just like the
3:03
number of people it's the heads of
3:05
critical departments the political
3:07
Department the Communications Department
3:08
the data Department this is a fullon
3:11
remaking of the RNC in Trump's image
3:14
there's going to be guys very little
3:16
daylight now between the Trump campaign
3:19
and the Republican National Committee
3:21
and so look there's always turnover when
3:24
a new candidate takes over the party it
3:26
is normal to send a couple of your
3:27
senior staffers over and it's a landing
3:29
party and you shake things up and maybe
3:31
you remove somebody or you layer the
3:33
people who are there with somebody you
3:34
prefer this is really an unusual level
3:37
of change to been implemented a top to
3:40
bottom house cleaning
3:43
yes so why Shane is Trump doing that
3:48
gutting the leadership and so much of
3:51
the staff of the most important
3:54
apparatus within the Republican party
3:57
right now well I think you and most of
3:58
your listeners know that we start this
4:01
general election in a race that Joe
4:03
Biden is behind he's losing in the polls
4:06
voters have concerns about his age they
4:08
have concerns about his handling of the
4:10
economy they have concerns about his
4:11
handling of immigration some of the most
4:13
important issues that voters say matter
4:15
to than this year but the one big
4:19
Advantage entering this general election
4:21
that Joe Biden has is the sort of
4:23
infrastructure mechanics of running for
4:26
president they have had a 10mon head
4:29
start on Donald Trump in hiring staff in
4:34
raising money in preparing for the
4:36
election that's now upon us and so for
4:39
Donald Trump he looked at what existed
4:41
at the RNC and he said this isn't good
4:45
enough interesting this isn't focused on
4:47
what I think is going to matter and I'm
4:49
going to get rid of these folks and I'm
4:51
going to put in my own team my own
4:53
imprint from the party chairman down to
4:56
the sort of foot soldiers in the swing
4:58
States we're a clean housee and start
5:01
over and it's a pretty big bet it's a
5:04
pretty big bet that he thinks that by
5:06
deconstructing the Republican National
5:08
Committee he can construct something
5:10
better and it's a race well before we
5:13
get to why Biden has an organizational
5:16
apparatus advantage over Trump and why
5:18
Trump felt the RNC needed to be burned
5:20
down and rebuilt Shane help us
5:23
understand what a Party Committee like
5:26
the Republican National Committee what
5:29
role it plays in a presidential race I
5:31
think everyone understands that there's
5:32
a campaign and there's a little less
5:34
Clarity around exactly what the party
5:36
committees do in a campaign I mean
5:39
they're absolutely essential to a
5:41
successful presidential campaign one of
5:44
the big reasons is just money which is
5:47
the party and the candidate can together
5:49
raise vastly more money than just the
5:52
candidate can why so the way campaign
5:55
contributions work is there are strict
5:57
limits for federal candidates stes so
6:00
Donald Trump can raise something like
6:02
$6,600 from an individual but Donald
6:05
Trump when working with the RNC and
6:08
state Republican parties across the
6:09
country can form this sort of Mega
6:11
committee and that committee can raise
6:13
something closer to
6:15
$800,000 from that same individual so
6:18
the scale you get when working with the
6:20
party is just incomparable to working on
6:23
your own so hundreds of millions of
6:26
dollars will flow through the Democratic
6:28
National Committee and through the
6:30
Republican National Committee so the
6:31
number one reason that the party matters
6:33
is money mhm there's also institutional
6:36
knowledge knowledge in local States and
6:39
there's a whole bunch of smaller things
6:40
including whether you send mail and how
6:42
you do various things that parties offer
6:44
efficiencies but the number one thing is
6:47
cash that Donald Trump and Joe Biden by
6:49
being linked in with the party which he
6:51
couldn't do until he becomes the
6:52
presumptive nominee gives you an
6:54
enormous cash pile that you can access
6:57
from big donors got it so with that
6:59
understanding walk us through the
7:03
advantages that the Biden Camp has with
7:06
its relationship to the Democratic
7:09
National Committee and the disadvantages
7:12
that it feels like Trump has with the
7:15
current version of the RNC that he's now
7:18
gutting well we talked about how much
7:20
bigger checks that Donald Trump can now
7:22
raise well Joe Biden's been raising
7:24
those checks for months and months and
7:27
what that means is that the Democratic
7:29
National committee and Joe Biden in
7:31
their joint efforts and they are very
7:33
much joint efforts they just announced
7:36
that they have $155 million in the bank
7:40
as of the end of February now the Trump
7:43
team hasn't announced a number for
7:44
February yet but at the end of January
7:47
the Republican National Committee had
7:49
less than $9 million and the Trump
7:52
campaign had around 30ish wow and I have
7:55
to think it's safe to assume that the
7:58
Trump campaign and the Republican Party
7:59
did not make up a more than $100 million
8:03
deficit within the last month yes that's
8:06
right in fact it's more likely that the
8:08
Democrats have an even bigger financial
8:10
advantage now than they had a month ago
8:13
and so this money issue is just really a
8:16
big daunting one for the Trump team at
8:19
the beginning of this election and
8:20
something that the Biden team not only
8:21
do they have that cash Advantage they've
8:23
been spending more money along the way M
8:25
so look right after the State of the
8:27
Union you can see the it and money
8:30
pretty clearly with the prot trump super
8:33
pack announcing its first ad buy of the
8:35
general election which is something like
8:36
above
8:37
$300,000 on black radio it's a symbolic
8:40
ad by they're going to Target
8:41
African-American voters who are
8:43
potentially moving toward Trump and then
8:45
the Biden campaign says they're
8:47
announcing their first ad buy and it's
8:49
$30 million over six weeks this is a 100
8:54
to1 ratio like money isn't everything in
8:59
some way it's especially less important
9:01
in a presidential race cuz voters pay so
9:03
much attention compared to like a house
9:05
race or a senate race even but if you
9:07
gave any candidate a chance to have a
9:10
100 to1 advertising ratio at any point
9:13
in an election cycle you'd take it you'd
9:15
absolutely take it okay so the first
9:16
really important thing to understand
9:17
here is that Democrats and the DNC are
9:19
just completely out fundraising Trump
9:22
and the RNC absolutely that is the First
9:24
Advantage okay what else the second one
9:27
I would say is sort of the actual
9:30
infrastructure of a candidacy and look
9:33
there's a moment this last week where
9:35
Joe Biden was starting to travel to
9:37
these swing States and he went to
9:40
Wisconsin one of the closest and most
9:42
important swing states in the country
9:43
arguably one of two of the most
9:45
important swing States in this election
9:46
absolutely and what was he doing he was
9:49
helping celebrate the opening of some
9:50
offices in Wisconsin Biden and the
9:53
Democrats are opening 44 offices wow in
9:57
the state and the contrast is that the
9:59
RNC and the Trump team are giving layoff
10:03
notices to the people who might be based
10:05
in Wisconsin and they have to reapply
10:07
for their jobs right does an office win
10:09
you votes maybe not a ton but in a race
10:12
that could be tens of thousands 10,000
10:14
votes in some of these states 44 offices
10:17
you start to do the math and like each
10:18
person in that office wins 50 votes in
10:20
the next six months or gets 50 people
10:22
out to vote like it actually starts to
10:24
make a difference in these really close
10:26
races and when you talk to the Biden
10:28
team and you talk to the Trump team they
10:30
agree that the Democrats have an
10:32
advantage here and by the way it's not
10:34
just Wisconsin that's just one example
10:36
this Cascades across most of the Swing
10:38
states where Biden has already built out
10:41
an entire team in Pennsylvania in
10:43
Georgia in Michigan and the Trump team
10:46
are are starting from scratch right okay
10:48
so money and infrastructure are the
10:50
clear Biden advantages that Trump is
10:52
looking at with some envy and when he
10:54
looks at the RNC with some dismay yeah
10:58
we've talked so far about the National
10:59
party right the Republican National
11:01
Committee and the Democratic National
11:02
Committee now every state has a state
11:05
party too which is related to the
11:07
National parties yes to a certain degree
11:09
absolutely money flows back and forth
11:11
between them but the state parties are
11:12
independent right they're supposed to
11:14
elect the governors of those States and
11:15
the senators of those States but these
11:17
swing state parties are really focused
11:20
on the presidential election and it just
11:22
so happens that the Republican party has
11:25
deep problems in some of the most
11:28
important state part parties in the
11:30
country such as let's start with
11:32
Michigan which has probably been the
11:34
messiest situation the former chairwoman
11:37
of the state party Christina kuramo had
11:41
misspent money so much so that the party
11:43
executed a coup against her and
11:45
overthrew her wow the incoming party
11:48
chairman at one point was getting locked
11:50
out of his emails there was a dispute
11:52
over whether he was in fact the rightful
11:54
chairman it's gone to court it's been a
11:56
whole big legal fight the House
11:59
Republicans had sort of sent money down
12:01
to this Michigan party a few months ago
12:02
saying we've got some really important
12:04
house races in Michigan and that
12:06
Michigan Republican party spent it on
12:07
other things and House Republicans are
12:09
like what are you doing they sent this
12:11
letter that was just in legal terms like
12:13
really a crazy letter saying you are
12:15
blowing our money it's like you don't
12:16
even want to elect Republicans what are
12:18
you doing so like Michigan that's one
12:21
state let's take Georgia another one of
12:23
the most important swing States the
12:26
former party chairman was among the
12:27
people who organized sort of fake
12:29
elector scheme to back Donald Trump in
12:31
2020 we need to lost the election well
12:34
he's among the people who have been
12:35
indicted for his role in that and before
12:38
he left as state party chairman he
12:40
indemnified himself and all the other
12:41
fake electors W so I think it's a 1.3 $1
12:45
1.4
12:46
million of the Georgia Republican
12:48
party's funding so far has gone to pay
12:50
the legal fees of the people involved in
12:52
that scheme including the former party
12:55
chairman that's less money on organizing
12:57
it's less money on all kinds of things
12:59
in Nevada another important swing state
13:01
the party chairman also faces an
13:04
indictment in Arizona another important
13:06
swing state there was another fight and
13:08
a resignation over who was in control of
13:10
the party again it happens that the
13:12
Republicans have these problems at these
13:14
State parties in several of the most
13:17
important states in the country and it
13:18
sounds like you're saying that this only
13:21
compounds Trump's problems at the
13:23
Republican National Committee because if
13:25
you have a kind of tattered and frayed
13:27
National political apparatus you would
13:29
like to have a very strong State party
13:32
apparatus to reinforce it you're saying
13:35
that clearly does not exist for Trump in
13:38
some of the most important States Trump
13:40
now has none of the above but it's worth
13:43
noting that in some of these states like
13:45
Georgia the problems here are in some
13:48
sense problems of Trump's own making
13:50
right these are people who tried to help
13:53
Trump win steal the 2020 election and
13:57
now they're facing legal Jeopardy
13:59
because of it so they have proven their
14:00
allegiance to Trump You could argue but
14:03
they are now a problem for the campaign
14:06
and its infrastructure nonetheless yeah
14:09
it's a strange situation but that's
14:11
absolutely right okay so put this all
14:13
together and it seems like you get to a
14:16
place where Trump may be justified in
14:21
doing what he just did which was kind of
14:22
inflicting this pretty traumatic set of
14:26
changes over at the RNC you didn't see
14:29
why the Trump team could look across the
14:31
Republican landscape and say yes we want
14:34
to start
14:35
over we have time to clean house and
14:38
start over and make this big bet that we
14:41
can build something better but it is a
14:43
bet it's a big
14:45
[Music]
14:53
bet we'll be right
14:58
back
15:00
[Music]
15:05
Shan before the break you made very
15:06
clear Republicans do have serious
15:08
organizational
15:10
disadvantages the question is will
15:13
Trump's wrecking ball strategy actually
15:16
fix that problem I mean we don't know
15:19
the answer to that question yet we do
15:21
know that the strategy comes with some
15:25
downsides right that there was work that
15:27
was happening that is stopped or paused
15:31
that there are people who are going to
15:32
be doing political work or other types
15:35
of work who are now spending their time
15:37
justifying their jobs or reapplying for
15:39
their jobs or onboarding new people
15:42
which can take time uh can take weeks
15:45
and you don't have that much time over
15:47
the course of an election especially
15:48
when where you are beginning less
15:51
organized than your opponent M I'm
15:53
curious what kind of work has been most
15:55
impacted by these layoffs there's one
15:57
really important program
15:59
that the chair of the Republican Party
16:02
who Trump just had removed Ron McDaniel
16:05
had put into place to try to get
16:07
Republicans to start voting early again
16:09
right despite the fact that Trump in
16:11
2020 told
16:13
Republicans that this wasn't a priority
16:15
because he was busy denouncing mail and
16:18
ballots as a corrupt function of the
16:20
democratic party and she has spent years
16:23
trying to fix that message to say to
16:26
Republicans guess what Republicans for
16:27
years had benefited from early voting
16:30
they would get their voters out early
16:31
and then they could go focus on the
16:33
folks who are less likely to vote and
16:35
get them out to vote now the new chair
16:37
that Trump has just brought into the
16:39
Republican party is pretty clearly not
16:42
as focused on this issue Michael Watley
16:45
the new chairman came from North
16:47
Carolina where he ran the party last
16:49
cycle and one of the reasons that Trump
16:51
was drawn to him is that he has been a
16:54
promoter of this idea that there's
16:57
massive voter fraud and that you have to
16:59
fight it and it certainly suggests that
17:00
they're moving their emphasis back to
17:02
this idea of voter fraud and so this is
17:04
one of the changes that is coming about
17:06
for the party maybe not for the better
17:08
for them this fall okay so the reality
17:10
of this house cleaning when it comes to
17:12
the person leading the Republican
17:13
National Committee is that it could end
17:15
up being a setback on the very important
17:19
logistical and organizational question
17:21
of getting Republicans to vote early and
17:25
vote by mail yes it could okay I want to
17:28
turn to the larger question of who Trump
17:32
is putting at the RNC as he is getting
17:34
rid of all these folks and bringing his
17:36
new team in and the one that stands out
17:39
the most and you mentioned it at the
17:40
very beginning of our conversation is
17:42
Trump's daughter-in-law we don't think
17:45
in American politics of generally
17:48
putting our family in positions of huge
17:51
prominence within party apparatus no I
17:55
think it's so important because it
17:56
speaks the symbolism of the complete in
17:59
Total Takeover of the Republican Party
18:02
by Donald Trump not only is he the
18:03
presumptive nominee now he's putting a
18:06
family member at the decision-making
18:09
table of the party as
18:11
co-chair and look this isn't a shock
18:14
right Donald Trump had Ivanka Trump and
18:16
Jared Kushner in key roles at the White
18:18
House fair enough you had Jared Kushner
18:20
serving as sort of the Quasi chairman of
18:23
his 2020 campaign but he didn't have an
18:25
official role in the party and so she's
18:28
important in that regard and I've
18:29
actually heard that people are already
18:31
responding in terms of small donations
18:33
to her name right the Republican base is
18:35
so excited for Trump that they want to
18:37
give to any Trump that's interesting
18:39
that adds to the appeal of giving to the
18:41
RNC for some Republicans the party said
18:43
that the first weekend after she was
18:46
there was the strongest weekend for
18:48
online fundraising that they had had
18:50
since
18:51
2020 right and she's gone on Fox News
18:54
and said that she's already gotten $2.7
18:56
million in pledges of donations
18:59
now that she's the co-chair of the party
19:01
but at the same time there would seem to
19:03
be a fine line between installing people
19:06
at the Republican National Committee who
19:08
are loyal to Trump and installing people
19:11
at the Republican National Committee who
19:14
are incapable of anything approaching
19:18
critical distance from Trump I mean one
19:21
of the first things that Laura Trump
19:23
said when she was given this new
19:26
appointment was that she was open to
19:29
using RNC funds to pay Donald Trump's
19:34
legal bills and suggests that she's
19:37
truly only thinking about Trump versus
19:40
any version of a RNC that has some
19:44
objective distance from Trump now she's
19:46
backed away from the legal fees she said
19:47
that the party won't now in fact pay for
19:50
his legal fees but you're exactly right
19:53
that she and the other team that have
19:55
gotten there have said the party now
19:57
exists to elect Donald Trump now you
20:00
could think of the Republican National
20:01
Committee of having a broader purpose
20:03
and helping down ballot races they've
20:05
made the argument you help Trump then a
20:07
rising tide lifts all boats the rest of
20:09
the boats are the rest of the
20:10
Republicans out there in the sea we're
20:12
going to lift Donald Trump and that's
20:13
what our focus is going to be and just
20:15
to be clear this is or isn't unusual
20:19
because you have made clear that the
20:21
Democratic and Republican committees do
20:23
exist to a certain degree to get their
20:25
party's nominee for president elected
20:27
but is this level of integration and
20:29
kind of loyalty
20:32
daughter-in-law co-chair of the party is
20:34
that usual no this is really unusual and
20:39
look you only have to look as far back
20:41
as Donald Trump's first race in
20:44
2016 when he was a sort of upand
20:47
cominging candidate who didn't have
20:48
political experience and when he became
20:50
the presumptive nominee that year he
20:52
arrived to the Republican National
20:54
Committee headquarters and found
20:56
professionals who knew what they were
20:58
doing
20:59
and he integrated into the existing
21:01
party apparatus and in fact empowered
21:04
them to run much of his campaign 8 years
21:07
later they flipped the entire direction
21:09
of it all the campaign is now completely
21:12
running and directing the party look
21:15
it's normal to send staff to start
21:18
taking over the functions of the party
21:19
this is how we want it to be done it
21:21
isn't common to replace the chair and in
21:24
fact I look back and has been 30 years
21:27
since a republic nominee swapped out the
21:31
party chair for someone of their
21:33
choosing in an election year so this an
21:36
unusual setup all around the question
21:39
that's still unresolved in my head Shane
21:41
is whether creating a Republican
21:43
National Committee with this level of
21:45
loyalty and I guess emotional and
21:48
ideological integration with Trump's
21:51
Mission and thinking and campaign is is
21:54
that the best strategy for republicans
21:57
and Trump to catch up with with Biden
21:59
and the Democratic National Committee
22:01
and I know it's early but just based on
22:03
your reporting does this feel like a
22:06
potentially winning formula for catching
22:09
up you know it's so hard to answer that
22:11
question but I would say that for the
22:13
Trump team they're confident Donald
22:16
Trump has entered the 2024 race with a
22:19
different level of confidence in his own
22:21
decisionmaking and his own political
22:24
instincts than he had when he ran in
22:26
2016 and then even when he ran in 2020
22:29
that's interesting and this feels like a
22:32
bet and his team's bet that they know
22:35
best Shane I want you to play with this
22:37
proposition we started this conversation
22:39
by you saying Biden's biggest strength
22:42
was organizational but thinking about
22:44
everything you're saying here it feels
22:46
like Trump has eight months to figure
22:49
out how to integrate the RNC and his
22:51
vision of it into his campaign and that
22:54
it's largely doable and if you're Trump
22:57
wouldn't you rather have that challenge
23:00
than Biden's current set of challenges
23:03
which feel more intractable widespread
23:06
disapproval of him from polls
23:09
disillusionment from young voters voters
23:11
of color and the entire conversation
23:14
about age that surrounds him in this
23:16
moment that seems like a bigger hurdle
23:20
than putting the right people in at the
23:22
RNC and raising a bunch of money over
23:24
the next few months that's definitely
23:26
the way the Trump people view it they
23:28
admit that they're behind on some of the
23:31
mechanics and infrastructure as a
23:33
solvable problem they think they can
23:35
close the gap in the coming months and
23:38
that even if they can't they think that
23:41
their message is going to be more
23:42
resonant with the American people this
23:44
year than Joe Biden's message of course
23:47
that's not how the Biden people see it
23:49
they think that in the coming months
23:50
that the polling disadvantage he has
23:52
right now that that's going to erode or
23:54
disappear or flip entirely that voters
23:57
are going to start to focus in on
23:58
Trump's weaknesses on the things they
23:59
didn't like about him when he was
24:01
president before and some of the more
24:03
radical things he's proposing if he
24:04
becomes president again that the
24:07
politics around the issue of abortion
24:09
have changed dramatically and that this
24:11
is the first election since January 6th
24:13
and that democracy itself is something
24:15
the voters are going to think
24:18
about what I would tell you is that as
24:21
boring as the idea of State party
24:23
apparatuses and financial advantages
24:25
sound that if this election is anywhere
24:28
near as close as the last two have been
24:31
which is thousands and tens of thousands
24:33
of votes in just a couple of states that
24:37
money and mechanical advantages is
24:39
exactly the kind of thing that can make
24:41
the difference between winning and
24:44
losing which is why it's so urgent for
24:47
the Trump team to make changes and close
24:50
the gap and for the Biden people to
24:53
press their advantage in the coming
24:57
months
24:58

25:20
back here's what else you need to day on
25:24
Monday Trump's lawyer said that he had
25:26
failed to secure a bond that would
25:28
guarantee payment of a nearly half
25:30
billion doll court judgment against him
25:32
in New York despite negotiations with 30
25:36
different bond companies Trump owes New
25:39
York State more than $450 million
25:42
stemming from a civil case in which the
25:44
judge found he had lied about the value
25:46
of his properties for years unless Trump
25:49
pays the money or secures a bond for it
25:52
within the next week New York state may
25:55
begin to seize his
25:57
assets and in closely watched oral
26:00
arguments a majority of Supreme Court
26:03
Justices seemed ready to reject a
26:05
republican Le attempt to prevent the
26:08
government from pressuring social media
26:10
companies to remove posts that it deems
26:13
dangerous to the public the case
26:16
revolves around a claim made by
26:18
Republicans in Missouri and Louisiana
26:20
that the Biden Administration has
26:22
violated the first amendment by trying
26:24
to censor social media companies but
26:27
most of the justices appeared convinced
26:29
that government officials should be able
26:31
to communicate with tech platforms about
26:34
problematic posts related to issues like
26:37
public health National Security and
