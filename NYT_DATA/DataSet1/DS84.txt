Your Car May Be Spying on You

from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
tavernes and this is the
0:07
[Music]
0:10
daily as modern cars become ever more
0:13
sophisticated pieces of Technology they
0:16
begun sharing information about their
0:18
drivers sometimes with unnerving
0:21
consequences today my colleague Kashmir
0:24
Hill explains what our cars now know and
0:28
what this means for our lives

Why Cars
0:44
18th so cashmir you're a data and
0:47
Technology reporter and you usually come
0:49
on the show to tell us some very
0:51
frightening new way that technology is
0:53
going to affect our lives this time
0:56
though you're coming on the show to talk
0:58
about car
1:01
why cars well like many Americans during
1:05
the pandemic I got a new car and I
1:08
hadn't had a car since 1999 when I was
1:11
in high school and cars have changed a
1:14
lot they've gotten much better they're
1:16
more sophisticated I mean they're
1:18
basically computers on Wheels but I know
1:21
that when you connect things to the
1:23
internet it has the ability to record
1:26
data about you watch you potentially spy
1:28
on you if you don't know what kind of
1:30
data is being collected and sent out so
1:33
you're sitting in this new car looking
1:34
around thinking okay this stuff is
1:37
probably spying on me exactly and I
1:40
wondered what kind of data our cars
1:44
collecting now and where are they
1:46
sending it who's getting it I just
1:48
wanted to know who's tapping into these
1:51
cars okay over here yeah and this
1:54
reporting led me to a woman named
1:56
Christine my name is Christine Del Ogden
1:59
and I'm from bger City Louisiana
2:01
Christina is a real estate agent in
2:03
Louisiana and for a while she also sold
2:06
medical supplies so her car or Mercedes
2:09
was really important to her work I had a
2:13
class c 300 and actually my car was
2:17
basically like my roving office and as a
2:21
rep in that capacity you have to live in
2:23
your car so it's pretty much like you're
2:26
home away from home Christina been
2:28
married for 10 years and her now late
2:31
husband was a federal agent and abusive
2:35
I kind of started losing my Independence
2:37
I guess you could say and one night he
2:40
got violent with her and she decided to
2:42
leave him she got in her car and she
2:46
drove 5 hours away to where her daughter
2:48
lived she ended up filing a police
2:51
report against her husband for domestic
2:53
violence and she did not want to be in
2:55
contact but he's texting her he's
2:58
calling her and then he started sending
3:00
her messages that indicate he knows
3:03
where she is in real
3:07
time and there were a lot of weird
3:09
incidents like this one particular
3:11
incident where she was on a work trip
3:14
and I'm sitting in a parking lot and she
3:16
was waiting for her colleague in her car
3:18
and all of a sudden he shows up and
3:20
backs up rolls his windows down and is
3:23
looking at me he suddenly shows up in
3:26
the parking lot wow and she had already
3:29
made sure that he couldn't track her
3:31
phone and then she realizes oh my God
3:34
and it just hit me in that moment that
3:36
it has to be the car it has to be the
3:38
car that the only way it could be
3:40
happening is that he is tracking her
3:43
[Music]
Mercedes Me
3:46
car and then I started thinking about
3:48
well the only thing that has tied me to
3:50
this car is going to be that Mercedes
3:52
app so and her Mercedes was connected to
3:57
an app Mercedes offers called Mercedes
4:00
me so I get on there and there's all
4:03
this information on there that says you
4:05
know you can open your car do it's one
4:08
of these connected car apps you can use
4:09
it to lock and unlock the vehicle maybe
4:12
turn it on remotely and you can also
4:14
find out the location of the car and so
4:17
that's what her husband was doing he was
4:19
tracking the location of the car and
4:21
thus seeing everywhere she went I had no
4:24
idea he was actually watching every move
4:26
I made that car was a red light you know
4:31
shining that oh she's here oh she's
4:34
there and he's constantly checking you
4:36
know that app looking to see where I was
4:38
we verified
4:39
[Music]
Calling Mercedes
4:46
that so what does she do once she has
4:49
this information so at this point she
4:52
already has a restraining order against
4:54
him so she lets the detective on her
4:56
case know hey he's tracking me and
5:00
that's when we start calling Mercedes
5:01
and I explained to them she calls
5:02
Mercedes because she wants to get his
5:06
access to the car you know turned off
5:08
revoked I didn't know he was going to
5:09
use the Embrace system to track
5:11
everywhere I went and that's what he's
5:12
been doing is tracking everywhere I go
5:15
let me ask you a question let me ask
5:18
you she is running into problems because
5:22
he's the owner of the car did they say
5:25
that the vehicle could be in your name
5:28
or was it an agreement that vehicle
5:30
stays in his name the title is in his
5:32
name and Christine told me it's a
5:34
decision that they made because he had
5:36
better credit but she is the one paying
5:38
for the car I've got it in my papers
5:42
that I get access to I have access to
5:44
the car I'm the only one that's ever
5:45
really paid a note on this
5:47
car and she actually had an order from
5:50
the judge that had awarded her ownership
5:53
of the car during divorce proceedings
5:55
she had this temporary restraining order
5:58
and so she's telling Mercedes look
6:00
I I know he's technically the owner of
6:02
the car but this is my car a judge has
6:04
said this is my car I have a restraining
6:06
order against him he's not supposed to
6:08
be getting this access to me please turn
6:10
this off but he has violated several
6:13
protection orders because he stalks me
6:15
on this
6:17
car and it's really hard to do anything
6:20
okay and she calls repeatedly because I
6:23
know I can't be the only woman that this
6:25
happened
6:26
to and they can't help her crazy the
6:30
person who owned the car had the right
6:32
to be connected to the vehicle and
6:34
Mercedes just didn't seem to have any
6:36
kind of protocol for what to do when
6:38
this happens that is really really
6:42
remarkable so what does she do so she
6:46
eventually ends up taking the Mercedes
6:47
to a mechanic and she pays $400 for him
6:51
to basically pull the device in the car
6:55
that provides internet connectivity so
6:57
she disconnects her car and it meant
7:00
that she lost kind of navigation
7:02
services in the car she lost the ability
7:04
to call roadside assistance but she
7:06
didn't care she said I just don't want
7:08
him to be able to track
Mercedes Response
7:11
me it's pretty terrifying this story
7:15
cash and I have to say it's pretty
7:17
surprising to me that there wasn't a way
7:19
Mercedes could stop this what did
7:21
Mercedes say about this Mercedes said
7:24
they could not comment on an individual
7:27
customer but this is is not just
7:30
Mercedes there have been other reports
7:32
of women this happened to with other car
7:34
brands with Tesla the detective in
7:37
Christine's case it actually had another
7:39
case just like this with Alexis and I
7:42
think what's really troubling here is
7:45
that cars are a Lifeline for these women
7:48
it's literally how they are getting away
7:51
from abusive
7:52
situations but because it's connected to
7:55
the internet it's another place where
7:57
they can be tracked
8:00
and harassed and this is the Paradox of
8:04
connected cars they are no longer
8:06
private
8:08
spaces and what do we make about the
8:10
fact that these cars you know they have
8:12
all this technology that now as we're
8:14
seeing can be exploited but the car
8:16
manufacturers don't seem to have
8:18
anticipated that yeah I mean car
8:20
manufacturers have been making cars for
8:23
a long time but they just started making
8:26
these connected cars really just in the
8:28
last decade and car companies when they
8:32
have thought about safety for example in
8:33
the past they're thinking about seat
8:36
belts they're not thinking about data
8:39
security right privacy and harassment
8:42
all of these things that happen when you
8:44
have humans combined with technology
8:47
these car companies are so new to this
8:50
and I don't think they've kind of worked
8:51
out the Kinks in the way that the
8:53
Googles and the Facebooks of the world
8:56
have to the extent that they have right
8:58
it's just not you know their thing yet
9:00
right they have come into this
9:01
technology space this digital space
9:04
looking around and not practiced at like
9:07
how to treat data carefully and really
9:09
what to do with it at all exactly and so
9:12
these are new problems for car makers
9:14
but they're not new problems when it
9:16
comes to
9:17
[Music]
9:20
technology and this was a case of a bad
9:24
actor invading the privacy of a driver
9:29
but as I continued my reporting I
9:32
discovered that car companies themselves
9:35
were invading the privacy of millions of
9:38
[Music]
9:50
drivers we'll be right
9:58
back
Car Companies Invading Privacy
10:00
so cashmir you said that these privacy
10:02
issues in cars actually go beyond
10:04
individuals exploiting technology that
10:07
in fact you discovered that car
10:08
companies themselves were invading
10:10
people's privacy tell me about that yeah
10:13
so for the story about how car apps were
10:16
being used by abusers I was spending a
10:18
lot of time on car forums places on the
10:21
internet where people talk about their
10:23
cars and their love of cars and issues
10:25
with cars on Reddit on kind of dedicated
10:28
discussion boards and I kept seeing the
10:31
same story over and over again and it
10:35
was people whose insurance rates had
10:38
gone up and they would ask the insurance
10:40
agent why did my insurance go up 20% you
10:43
know 50% or why can't I get insurance
10:46
and the agent would tell them you need
10:48
to pull your Lexus Nexus
Lexus Nexus
10:52
report so Lexus Nexus they're basically
10:55
a big data broker and Lexus Nexus has a
10:58
division called called Lexus Nexus Risk
11:01
Solutions and historically it's kept
11:04
track of you know moving violations
11:06
speeding tickets any accidents you've
11:08
been in whether you were at fault or not
11:10
at fault and so these people go to Lexus
11:13
Nexus they ask for their files and when
11:16
it comes to them the files are hundreds
11:19
of pages
The files
11:22
long and in them they are finding
11:26
information about every trip they have
11:29
taken in their cars over the previous 6
11:32
months how far they drove when the trip
11:35
started when the trip ended how many
11:38
times they heartbreak heart accelerated
11:41
or sped wow and these people were
11:45
shocked and so they came to the online
11:46
Forum saying why is this happening does
11:48
anyone know why this is happening and
11:50
how do I turn this
11:51
[Music]
How was it happening
11:55
off okay so what's the answer how was it
11:58
happening so so you know we talked
12:00
earlier that cars can collect this
12:02
really detailed data and that's what was
12:05
happening the cars were collecting this
12:07
data um this was happening to people who
12:09
drove cars made by General Motors
12:11
General Motors was getting this data and
12:13
then General Motors was giving it to
12:15
Lexus Nexus wow okay so the car company
12:19
itself was actually just handing it over
12:22
well I don't think they were just doing
12:23
it for free uh but yes they were sharing
12:26
and selling this data and it wasn't for
12:30
everybody it wasn't everybody who drove
12:32
a GM car um that this was happening to
12:35
it was happening to a subset of people
12:37
who had knowingly or unknowingly in some
12:41
cases been enrolled in something called
12:44
smart driver and what's smart driver so
12:47
smart driver is a feature offered by GM
12:50
it's called OnStar smart driver and it's
12:53
supposed to be a program to help you be
12:56
a better driver and you can collect
12:58
digital badges for being a good driver
13:00
like break genius and speed limit hero
13:04
and you get some feedback like take it
13:05
easy on the brakes you know don't speed
13:07
up so much make sure you're leaving room
13:09
in front of your car you're not going to
13:11
hit the person in front of you like
13:13
don't tailgate so it's a little bit like
13:14
one of those exercise apps like great
13:16
job you ran five miles nice breaking
13:18
there or on the contrary yeah it was
13:20
that gamification of real life right
13:22
like get a good score be a good driver
13:25
but what people who turn this on didn't
13:28
realize was that there was something
13:29
buried in the privacy policy that no one
13:32
reads that said that they could share
13:34
that data with third parties and the
13:36
third parties that they were sharing it
13:37
with were Lexus Nexus and another data
13:40
broker that works with the insurance
13:42
industry called verisk so some kind of
13:45
vague fine print lets them turn this
13:48
driving game into a data harvesting
13:50
machine essentially yeah so when I
13:52
talked to GM the spokesperson said that
13:55
people could turn this on in the vehicle
13:58
app or or at the dealership when they
14:00
bought the car so it seemed possible
14:02
that this was quietly being turned on at
14:06
the dealership by
14:07
salespeople and I found this company
14:10
manual that said that salespeople could
14:12
earn bonuses from GM by getting drivers
14:15
to enroll in OnStar connected services
14:18
including smart driver I mean there's
14:20
something kind of creepy about it right
14:22
like these people were driving around
14:24
they had no idea that every move they
14:26
made including when they break when they
14:28
turned how fast they approached a stop
14:30
sign all of that was kind of being
14:33
watched it feels like a fundamental
14:35
violation of privacy in your own car one
14:39
of the drivers I talked to said it felt
14:41
like a betrayal like he had no idea this
14:43
information was getting collected and
14:45
that it would be shared in this way that
14:47
cost him financially like his insurance
14:49
went up and he said I'm a safe driver
14:51
I've never been in an accident I don't
14:53
even kind of understand how they're
14:55
judging me on this so it it was really
14:57
confusing to the people this was
14:58
happening to and how much were their
15:01
rates actually going up like give me an
15:03
example so one Cadillac driver I talked
15:06
to in Palm Beach Florida said that he
15:10
actually got denied by seven auto
15:13
insurance companies and he wound up
15:16
paying double what he was paying before
15:18
for his auto insurance that is a huge
15:21
increase how typical was that do you
15:22
have a sense of that you know it's hard
15:24
to tell it was just a lot of posts on
15:26
these different forums and some people
15:28
said 20%
15:29
some people didn't know how much it
15:32
affected their insurance but yeah it
15:34
seemed to range from I saw 20% I saw 50%
15:37
and I saw people who said their
15:39
insurance doubled and what was the scope
15:41
here in terms of companies I mean was
15:43
this just GM so I was only seeing people
15:47
really explicitly complaining about GM
15:50
cars i' had this experience of my
15:52
insurance went up I went to Lexus Nexus
15:54
I found my details but then when I
15:56
started looking into this I saw that
15:58
actually a lot of different automakers
16:00
are starting to do a form of this and
16:03
some of the automakers said you know
16:04
this is about safety we're trying to
16:06
help people be better drivers often they
16:09
have like a driver score or driver
16:11
feedback or a road score in their app
16:14
and sometimes it's the data broker
16:16
that's actually giving you the score in
16:17
the app not your automaker okay so they
16:20
say it's for safety does that
16:22
explanation hold water so a version of
16:24
this has been going on for a long time
16:26
there's something called usage based
16:28
insurance
16:29
where you with your insurance company
16:31
say okay I'll put a dongle in my car or
16:34
I'll put your app on my smartphone and
16:36
I'll let you monitor my driving and
16:39
those programs have actually been quite
16:41
successful like I talked to one expert
16:42
and he says that when people are
16:44
knowingly doing this being observed that
16:48
the impact on safety is enormous that
16:50
you know these people become better
16:53
drivers but that doesn't work if you
16:56
don't know that you're enrolled in this
16:59
program if you don't know that how you
17:01
drive is going to impact your insurance
17:03
then you're not going to improve your
17:05
driving there's no there's no safety
17:07
benefit here at the same time there's
17:09
this question of what does this data
17:11
even mean what is what is hard breaking
17:13
what is hard acceleration how does it
17:15
reflect how risky a driver you are I was
17:18
actually thinking about this a couple
17:19
days ago because I was driving home late
17:21
at night and a herd of deer just
17:25
suddenly sprinted across the road and I
17:26
had to slam on the brakes and I saved my
17:29
car insurance company a bunch of money
17:31
CU I didn't hit the deer and damag my
17:33
car but I wonder in the data do I look
17:36
like a terrible driver who was
17:38
tailgating somebody and then had to slam
17:39
on the brakes I mean back to your point
17:42
earlier in the show right these car
17:43
companies are kind of tech companies in
17:45
training right and and I imagine that
17:47
they will soon learn some of the lessons
17:49
that other tech companies have had to
17:51
learn which is surveilling your
17:52
customers collecting troves of data that
17:55
doesn't go unnoticed for long periods of
17:58
time I mean it will have a response
18:02
people are not happy about this and I've
18:04
been watching those I'm still in those
18:06
online car forums and I see people
18:09
reacting to this story and they're
18:11
saying oh my God I just checked my app
18:13
and I'm signed up for this I can't
18:15
believe it they're saying I'm not going
18:17
to buy a GM car um I'm not going to buy
18:20
any of the cars that are mentioned in
18:21
this article but the thing is there's
18:23
there's lots of different automakers
18:25
that are doing this I talked to Senator
18:27
Ed Marky about this senator from
18:29
Massachusetts senator from Massachusetts
18:31
he's been talking to car makers asking
18:34
them what data are you collecting about
18:35
people who are you sharing it with and
18:37
they had sent him some very evasive
18:39
answers but he said when I described to
18:41
him what was happening with GM he said
18:45
that sounds like a violation of the law
18:48
that protects consumers against unfair
18:50
and deceptive business practices and a
18:53
couple of days after my story came out
18:55
there was a class action lawsuit filed
18:57
against General ERS and Lexus Nexus in
19:01
the southern district of Florida so this
19:03
is really a moving Target in terms of
19:06
you know in a way a new social problem I
19:08
mean you started digging into the
19:10
Privacy implications of these cars and
19:12
and you found pretty quickly two very
19:14
egregious examples of ways car drivers
19:18
privacy is being violated which kind of
19:20
makes me wonder you know what else is
19:23
going on with these cars that we don't
19:24
even know about yet right honestly this
19:26
is what I have been seeing in the last
19:28
decade or so that I've been reporting on
19:30
privacy and data collection at first I
19:32
was writing about Facebook and Google
Internet connected
19:36
but now everything is Internet connected
19:38
it's not just cars so many of the
19:40
products we get your your TV your vacuum
19:44
sometimes your bed your toothbrush like
19:46
they want to put a Wi-Fi connection on
