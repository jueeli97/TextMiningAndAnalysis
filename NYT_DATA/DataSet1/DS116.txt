On the Ballot in South Carolina: Bidenâ€™s Pitch to Black Voters



0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael baboro
0:04
this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:10
daily
0:12
today when the Democratic presidential
0:15
nomination process begins tomorrow in
0:17
South Carolina the question is not who
0:21
will win but whether President Biden can
0:24
fix his growing problem with black
0:28
voters my colleague Maya King
0:34
explains it's Friday February
0:37
[Music]
0:43
2nd so Maya after weeks of covering the
0:48
Republican Presidential nomination
0:50
process in Iowa and then New Hampshire
0:53
we are now officially ready to turn to
0:56
the Democratic nomination process and
0:59
that begins in South Carolina not where
1:02
it used to begin which was in Iowa along
1:05
with the Republicans starting there and
1:07
just to begin remind us why South
1:10
Carolina is going first this year so
1:14
this process really started four years
1:16
ago when black voters in South Carolina
1:19
turned out in large numbers to vote for
1:23
then candidate Biden effectively saving
1:26
his campaign he was really trailing in
1:31
Iowa and in New Hampshire right and it
1:33
was when he got to South Carolina that
1:36
all of these black voters seeing him as
1:39
really the most pragmatic option turned
1:41
out in these large numbers to vote for
1:44
him and he took that momentum from South
1:47
Carolina to Super Tuesday where he won
1:50
pretty
1:51
overwhelmingly and then of course was
1:53
then the Democratic party's nominee for
1:55
president right and Biden's very
1:57
explicit about this and proud of it he
2:00
will frequently say black voters in
2:02
South Carolina saved revived my primary
2:07
campaign and they are the reason I'm
2:09
president he is not quiet about the role
2:11
that South Carolina has played in his
2:14
life and certainly in his political
2:16
livelihood President Biden really points
2:18
to South Carolina and black voters here
2:21
as a really key part of his Coalition
2:24
and it's the reason why he openly says
2:26
he asked the Democratic party to put
2:29
South Carolina first in the order of
2:31
early primary States putting black
2:34
voters black Americans in the driver's
2:37
seat being the first Democrats in the
2:39
country to decide who they want to be
2:43
president and there's not a lot of
2:45
suspense around what's going to happen
2:47
tomorrow the primary here in South
2:49
Carolina is largely uncompetitive it's
2:52
very clear that Biden will be victorious
2:54
MH however we're not really watching for
2:58
the election result SS we're more
3:01
looking at what's happening outside of
3:02
them and some of the Dynamics that have
3:05
caused Democrats to really hone in on
3:07
South Carolina and it's because they've
3:10
identified in polling in focus groups
3:12
and conversations a real problem with
3:16
one of the key coalitions that they will
3:18
need in November and that's black
3:22
voters and that's why South Carolina for
3:25
the last several weeks has been
3:26
something of a a laboratory or a proven
3:29
ground of sorts for Democrats as they
3:32
try to form a message that would excite
3:35
and Galvanize black voters not just here
3:38
but across the country Democrats hope
3:41
here is that what they learn from black
3:43
voters in South Carolina is applicable
3:47
to Black voters in other parts of the
3:49
country cities like Detroit Milwaukee
3:52
even Atlanta with large black
3:55
communities in key swing
3:58
States
4:00
[Music]
4:02
well may remind us of just how
4:06
meaningful a problem Biden has with
4:10
black voters according to all the data
4:13
that you have been looking at it's a
4:15
pretty big problem in 2020 President
4:19
Biden won the election with about
4:22
87% of the black vote but polling that
4:26
the times has done found that at this
4:30
stage he only has about
4:32
71% of support from black voters that's
4:35
a pretty steep decline sure is and
4:39
what's even more concerning for
4:40
Democrats is that former president Trump
4:43
has actually increased his support among
4:46
black voters from 8% that he won in 2020
4:50
to about
4:51
22% that our poll found late last year
4:55
it's a really striking drift away from
4:57
Biden because a Republican presidential
5:00
candidate has not topped more than 12%
5:03
from black voters in almost 50 years W
5:07
and so if former president Trump were to
5:09
really have more than 20% support from
5:12
black voters that would be a historic
5:14
shift in Black voting
5:16
behavior I'm curious Maya in your
5:19
reporting what are you finding explains
5:22
such a major decline in support from
5:26
what you have described as a core and
5:30
historically faithful group of Biden
5:33
supporters these black voters I me what
5:35
reasons are being offered to explain it
5:38
I've spoken to Black voters across the
5:40
country hi this is Maya King I'm a
5:42
reporter with the New York hi is
5:44
historian yes hi Alita hello yes hello
5:49
hi Avon it's MAA King with the New York
5:50
Times is now a good time to chat one
5:53
theme that's really emerged in these
5:54
conversations Michael has been this
5:56
general feeling of malaise I'm just not
5:59
won like they haven't won me over yet
6:02
everybody talks and gets everybody to
6:04
vote for them and then when they get in
6:06
the office they don't do a lot of the
6:08
things that they say they're going to do
6:09
people want to and also this idea that
6:12
President Biden campaigned and made so
6:15
many promises to Black voters but did
6:17
not deliver on those promises H like
6:20
what student loan debt is one issue that
6:23
comes up quite a bit because I'm looking
6:26
at the fact that now I got a bill that I
6:28
got to pay that I barely make end meet
6:30
to so it's like what did you really do a
6:35
lot of black folks that I talk to are up
6:37
to their necks in student loan debt and
6:39
they remember the promise that Democrats
6:42
made to try to alleviate some of that
6:45
like you guys talk so much about getting
6:47
it done and then the forgiveness is not
6:50
but for so long you know what I mean
6:52
like they'll let you not have to pay for
6:54
a little bit but then you have to wind
6:56
up paying it anyway so I mean and they
6:58
also remember how that hasn't really
7:00
worked out and it feels like a promise
7:04
that really fell through one that they
7:05
were really looking forward to that
7:07
Democrats did not make good on right
7:10
Biden attempted to make good on it
7:11
through executive action he has been
7:13
undermined largely by Republicans
7:15
seeking to block him in the courts and
7:17
he hasn't had a lot of success with the
7:19
courts right and how old are you I'm 18
7:22
okay so you are and especially when I
7:24
talk to younger voters what they point
7:26
out to me is his age I know a lot people
7:29
talk about how like old he is and how
7:32
he's like he's too old to like get
7:34
around or soon they'll say that he'll
7:37
like pass away they see him as this
7:40
representative of a bygone era of
7:42
politics that he doesn't understand or
7:45
really relate to a lot of the issues
7:47
that are more relevant to their lives
7:49
and that they just don't see him as a
7:51
figure who is really compelling to them
7:54
who they would want to vote for and feel
7:57
enthusiastic about right what do you
7:59
want to see Biden do and like what
8:00
should he tell people your age to get
8:02
people to listen and and turn back out
8:05
to vote I feel like a effective message
8:08
would just be like knowing that he's
8:11
listening like maybe he doesn't know
8:13
right this is kind of the age and
8:15
Charisma question that has trailed Biden
8:19
now for years absolutely another thing
8:22
that I hear a lot is of course the
8:24
economy that things are more expensive
8:27
that even though people are working it's
8:29
hard for them to afford housing to
8:31
afford groceries and to afford being
8:33
able to support their families at the
8:35
same time we looking at the economy and
8:37
was best for the people you know gas
8:39
prices were lower you know more jobs
8:42
were available for people and they point
8:45
to this steep uptick in prices and this
8:49
General harder living as really having
8:53
been palpable under Biden's presidency
8:56
this country is a business and a man
8:58
with business ethics such as Trump you
9:00
know led the company great I mean and
9:02
this is where Trump's appeal starts to
9:04
really show itself I look at it as a
9:07
business aspect and a better choice for
9:10
this country by the way that it is would
9:12
be Donald Trump I spoke to a voter who
9:15
said that he felt the economy was better
9:17
under former president Trump that he
9:19
looked at the former president's
9:21
position as a businessman in his words
9:25
and said that he has a better grasp of
9:28
what's happened in the economy
9:30
interesting I'm just waiting to see
9:32
who's going to have the best views who's
9:34
going to put out the best policies for
9:36
the American people and whatever side
9:38
that is you know that's what side I will
9:40
lean to but today you're saying that's
9:42
Trump
9:44
correct and what else are you hearing
9:46
from these black voters well something
9:49
that's come up a little more recently in
9:52
conversations with particularly black
9:55
organizers and Community leaders and
9:58
Faith leaders
10:00
is a real disaffection for Biden in
10:04
terms of their perception of his support
10:06
for the war between Israel and Hamas
10:09
black Faith leaders are extremely
10:11
disappointed in the Biden Administration
10:15
on this issue I spoke with a number of
10:18
black pastors across the country there
10:20
are many who are when I have
10:23
conversations with them having real
10:26
issues with the White House who said
10:29
that the folks in their pews their
10:31
congregants are really upset and
10:34
disappointed in the Biden Administration
10:37
babies and incubators and mothers and
10:40
fathers children people had nothing to
10:42
do with
10:43
Hamas um being killed as they see on the
10:47
news on social media and in their feeds
10:51
these images of Destruction in Gaza and
10:55
the fact that 25,000 have been killed
10:58
without the kind of outcry in America uh
11:01
we know wouldn't happen if these were
11:03
white people we know that and so there
11:07
is that commonality that black Americans
11:10
feel but we and they have started to
11:14
understand or feel some sort of kinship
11:17
between Palestinians and their plight
11:20
and that of black Americans that both of
11:24
these groups in some way are both
11:26
oppressed people or have a history of
11:29
Oppression in their respective countries
11:31
being taken we're giving Israel a lot of
11:35
taxpayer money to my knowledge with no
11:39
conditions and Netanyahu is telling us
11:43
just give us the money and leave us
11:45
alone that's
11:48
untenable that's untenable they feel
11:51
like the Biden Administration has played
11:53
such a role in helping Finance this and
11:57
it's really impacted their support now
12:00
among a very key group of black voters
12:02
black Faith voters for the Biden
12:05
Administration and when you say black
12:07
Faith
12:08
voters just explain that these are
12:12
largely older black folks churchgoing
12:15
folks who spend a lot of time in Black
12:19
Faith spaces and this is really a group
12:22
of people that lies at the core of
12:25
Biden's black support H these are the
12:28
folks who
12:29
vote very regularly in almost every
12:31
election and also I should point out
12:34
that black churches are a really
12:36
important part of Democrats get out the
12:38
vote efforts right that's been a place
12:40
where they've always been able to talk
12:42
directly to Black voters so it's very
12:44
striking now to hear that the same folks
12:47
who are pretty used to hearing from
12:49
Democrats talking about politics may
12:52
have even had Biden come visit their
12:55
church are saying that they are paying
12:58
attention to to his foreign policy and
13:00
saying that they really really don't
13:02
agree with it so assuming the Biden
13:05
campaign has found similar reasons as
13:09
you have for the growing black
13:12
disillusionment with him in this
13:13
re-election campaign it feels like the
13:16
challenge for them is just the breath of
13:19
explanations voters are giving for why
13:22
they're souring on him it's not just one
13:25
thing it's a dozen things it's economic
13:29
explanations it's a personal
13:32
disconnection it's things like his
13:34
support for Israel in the war against
13:36
Gaza and that would seem to all add up
13:39
to a very
13:40
challenging problem to
13:43
fix yes and it's a problem that can't be
13:47
fixed with a single message it's really
13:50
one that they're going to have to tackle
13:52
across multiple fronts and so I think
13:55
that's why you see so much money and
13:58
time and effort being poured into a
14:00
state like South
14:02
Carolina this is the campaign's first
14:04
chance to really tackle this issue and
14:07
figure out what exactly they'll need to
14:09
do to fix this problem that they have
14:12
with black voter enthusiasm and
14:14
replicate that in places across the
14:19
[Music]
14:27
country
14:32
we'll be right
14:37
back so Maya as the Biden campaign tries
14:40
to solve its black voter problem in
14:44
South Carolina what has its efforts
14:47
there actually looked like on the ground
14:51
how is it trying to shore up and win
14:53
back some of these black voters well
14:56
Democrats have spared no expense in
14:58
their efforts here in South
15:02
Carolina we've seen about a sixf figure
15:05
investment in Staffing and that's senior
15:08
advisers to the campaign and also an
15:10
army of field staffers who have been in
15:13
the more Rural and heavily black areas
15:15
of the state hello hello South
15:19
Carolina it's good to be home with so
15:22
many friends President Biden himself has
15:25
been to South Carolina twice in the last
15:27
month good good
15:30
afternoon good afternoon South Carolina
15:33
good after vice president Harris has
15:35
been here three times and we've also
15:38
seen several pretty high-profile
15:40
Democrats come and visit the state and
15:42
encourage folks to turn out people like
15:45
House Majority Leader hakeim Jeff
15:48
California governor Gavin Nome and all
15:51
of them are going to these really
15:54
far-flung parts of the state meeting
15:56
with voters talking with them and it is
15:59
you who convinced your neighbors and
16:02
family members and friends and
16:04
co-workers reminding them of the role
16:07
that they played in the 2020 election in
16:10
so doing South Carolina set the path for
16:15
Joe Biden to become president of the
16:17
United States and me to be the first
16:20
black woman Vice President of the United
16:22
States it is you who did
16:27
that
16:30
and what is the
16:32
overarching message that Biden Harris
16:35
and all these representatives from the
16:36
campaign are really experimenting with
16:39
as they speak to these groups of black
16:42
voters I heard a slogan multiple times
16:46
when I was at Democrats first in the
16:48
nation dinner last Saturday it was this
16:51
message of promises made Promises Kept
16:56
and they're driving home this message
16:58
Democrats that they actually have made
17:01
good on many of the campaign promises
17:04
that they made in 2020 it's just that
17:06
they've done a pretty poor job of
17:08
articulating them in the past so the
17:10
campaign is speaking pretty directly to
17:12
what you have found Maya and you're
17:13
reporting that there's a perceived gap
17:17
between what Biden said he would do for
17:19
Black America and what he has actually
17:21
been able to do I'm really curious what
17:23
are the examples that the campaign
17:26
points to where they can say
17:29
here's a promise we made that we
17:30
actually kept well where you see an
17:34
argument from a black voter in polling
17:37
or even in our own reporting about
17:40
falling short of the Biden
17:42
Administration you can expect to see
17:44
here in South Carolina Biden himself
17:47
countering that message and saying this
17:50
is where we've actually helped you and
17:53
this is where this Administration has
17:54
delivered on the Promises it's made I
17:56
promise help ease accumulated student
17:58
debt for millions of folks carrying
18:00
during the crisis and the pandemic
18:02
Supreme Court blocked me but it didn't
18:05
stop me on the point of student loan
18:08
forgiveness this idea that Biden dropped
18:11
the ball on relieving student loans
18:14
another 25,000 people a month beginning
18:18
next month are going to start to get
18:20
their student loans forgiven because
18:21
they're getting notified with a letter
18:23
from me you're about to get that relief
18:26
they've come out on these large stages
18:28
and actually talked about instances
18:30
where people have had their student
18:32
loans relieved through different
18:35
policies that the Biden campaign has
18:36
passed MH record
18:39
unemployment including the lowest levels
18:43
of black unemployment ever recorded in
18:45
American history they've also pared out
18:48
the fact that black unemployment is the
18:50
lowest it's ever been I promise
18:54
you we' make record investment in HBCU
18:57
including South South Carolina's 8
19:02
HBCU HBCU student are just as talented
19:06
as any student in
19:08
America but their colleges and
19:10
universities don't have the funding and
19:12
endowments for The Cutting Ed
19:14
Laboratories and research centers
19:16
they've gone to a number of historically
19:18
black colleges and universities here in
19:21
South Carolina and actually laid out how
19:24
much money each university has received
19:27
from the Biden Administration well I've
19:30
invested so far $7 billion in HBCU and
19:36
accounting help support our brilliant
19:38
HBCU students and again a promise made
19:41
and a promise kept making the point that
19:45
this president has invested more in
19:48
historically black colleges than
19:50
actually any other president in history
19:52
interesting other policies that I've
19:54
heard quite a bit a little bit more in
19:57
the weeds but I think it does matter to
19:59
these rural voters 40,000 projects in
20:03
across American County rebuilding our
20:06
roads and our bridges affordable
20:08
high-speed internet everywhere in
20:11
America ripping out every poisonous lead
20:14
pipe in America so every child can turn
20:17
on a faucet drink clean water without
20:20
worrying about brain damage things like
20:22
rural broadband and internet access in
20:24
far-flung parts of the state
20:27
infrastructure clean water and pipes and
20:29
some of these places that historically
20:31
have not had access to those things and
20:34
all the progress we've made comes down
20:36
to a simple
20:38
proposition promises made and Promises
20:43
Kept right it's an interesting approach
20:46
I mean on their own some of these things
20:49
that the campaign is talking about seem
20:52
relatively small but the idea is to have
20:57
those accumulate into a message that
21:01
your life is better under President
21:03
Biden so stick with him but what that
21:07
seems to leave out are the less tangible
21:11
objections that black voters might have
21:14
to President Biden that you found in
21:16
your reporting his age and the war in
21:19
Gaza issues that are more complicated
21:22
and harder for the campaign to
21:25
counteract than something like internet
21:29
access or clean
21:31
water right and these are things that
21:34
the campaign is going to have to work on
21:36
over the next 10 months but I think what
21:39
they're really driving home here in
21:42
South Carolina is a counter to this
21:45
message that they have not tangibly
21:46
changed the lives of people and actually
21:50
affected change in these different
21:52
communities and I think that their hope
21:54
is that once more people understand the
21:56
way that these policies have positively
21:59
impacted their lives it could counter
22:01
some of the ill feeling that voters
22:03
might have towards Biden so how is the
22:06
campaign attempting to measure the
22:09
success of what they're up to in South
22:11
Carolina like you said they know they're
22:14
going to win so when the data rolls in
22:17
at the end of Saturday and they look at
22:20
it how are they going to know what is
22:23
effective in galvanizing black voters
22:26
and just as importantly how are they
22:27
going to understand and what's not
22:28
effective in galvanizing black
22:31
Fighters you know Democrats have been
22:34
pretty tight lipped here in South
22:35
Carolina in terms of identifying what
22:38
success would look like for them but in
22:40
conversations with people who will
22:42
really be watching turnout numbers
22:44
tomorrow I think if we see large turnout
22:48
especially in these heavily black areas
22:50
of the state Biden's allies here in
22:52
South Carolina can count that as a
22:55
winm so that's the measure turnout how
22:58
many people actually show up with the
22:59
polls which is a little bit complicated
23:02
because as we've said this is not a
23:04
competitive primary it's on a weekend
23:07
and the way you get people out to the
23:09
polls is usually by giving them a
23:11
competition in which they have very
23:13
strong
23:14
feelings that's right and that really is
23:16
Democrats challenge here even as they've
23:19
laid out this message and aimed to get
23:22
more voters excited about supporting
23:25
President Biden's
23:26
reelection it's really difficult to
23:29
actually get people to vote for that in
23:31
a largely uncontested race and of course
23:34
former president Trump who is likely to
23:37
be the Republican nominee will not be on
23:39
this ballot in the primary but if we do
23:42
find pretty large turnout after Saturday
23:45
I think it points to the success of this
23:47
entire operation but even though this is
23:50
not a competitive
23:52
primary Democrats still turned out to
23:56
show their support for for This
23:58
president's re-election it strikes me
24:00
that if this strategy doesn't end up
24:02
working if it doesn't work in South
24:03
Carolina and if it doesn't end up
24:05
working in any of the states where
24:07
Democrats need to turn out black voters
24:09
that this might not just be a problem
24:12
for President Biden and of course it
24:13
would be a problem for Biden it might
24:15
cost him the election but if as
24:17
Democrats fear black voters are open to
24:21
Trump and are willing to vote for a
24:23
republican in ways they haven't in
24:25
decades then this becomes a much larger
24:28
problem perhaps even crisis for the
24:31
entire Democratic party and its brand
24:34
that's right it would mean a fundamental
24:37
reordering of the democratic
24:42
Coalition and that would create much
24:45
longer term issues for any Democrat
24:48
running for president or even down
24:54
ballot right and so for all those
24:56
reasons what happens in South Carol
24:57
Carina matters because it's the start of
25:01
something very important that keeps
25:03
black voters with the Democratic party
25:06
or it's the beginning of a real rupture
25:10
potentially that
25:12
relationship it's a significant moment
25:14
and so in the same way that black voters
25:19
turning out in Mass for President Biden
25:21
in 2020 was what drove his momentum to
25:25
ultimately win the election right now 4
25:28
years later the possibility of black
25:31
voters shifting away from Democrats
25:34
after South Carolina could be the thing
25:37
that threatens his re-election here in
25:41

26:18
back here's what else you need to know
26:21
today on Thursday the European Union
26:24
authorized the creation of a $ 54
26:26
billion fund to support Ukraine in its
26:29
war against Russia a crucial Lifeline
26:33
because Congress has refused to adopt
26:35
new American funding for the country the
26:39
EU fund had previously been blocked by
26:41
the leader of Hungary Victor Orban an
26:44
ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin
26:47
but in the latest round of negotiations
26:50
Orban dropped his
26:52
opposition
26:54
and President Biden has ordered Broad
26:57
financial and travel sanctions against
27:00
at least four Israeli settlers accused
27:03
of violent attacks on Palestinians in
27:05
the West Bank his toughest actions
27:08
against Israel to date since it declared
27:11
war on Hamas the times reports that the
27:14
sanctions are aimed in part at assuaging
27:18
Arab American voters in the US who have
27:21
expressed Fury over Biden's forceful
27:24
support of Israel in the war
