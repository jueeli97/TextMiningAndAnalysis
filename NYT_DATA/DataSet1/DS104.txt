for her for sure yeah and he has also
10:12
another child he just maybe two and a half years oh wow so she's caring for a
10:18
two-year-old as well yes G going back to your own story of
10:26
evacuating so if I'm counting right when did you get to Han yunice you'd been on
10:32
the road for about two weeks at that point right yeah and the first week is
10:38
so hard for me the first week we have to build a tent for us because the
10:43
buildings inside the shelter they were all very crowded so we prefer to build a
10:49
tent so I'm living inside the tent it's not like a camping tent the first night
10:54
we didn't take any covers any blankets anything with us so we had to put some
11:01
nylons and Plastics and woods to cover us and I remember one day I want to go
11:08
to bathroom I couldn't and I have to wait for uh more than two hours in the line to go to bathroom so then I went to
11:16
one of the buildings and there was a guard there and he told me no this is only for the worker who is working here
11:22
I told him I need to go to bathroom he told me now you can I told him I'm not talking about taking your heart or
11:29
taking your eyes I'm asking to go to bathroom I opened the door and went and he was shouting on me I told him I don't
11:35
care I'm a human I'm a woman and this is my right yeah it's very humilated
11:42
actually you know this is the horrible thing I can ever experience in my life
11:48
you know yeah like the a I cannot control it the Shillings I cannot
11:54
control it but going to bathroom I'm just feeling like uh
12:02
I will argue I will fight I will do anything I cannot
12:07
accept I understand
12:14
yeah g how long did you spend in hunis three months three months in
12:22
hunis yeah from 20 of October till the 20 of
12:27
January and after that we woke up in early in the morning and I found news
12:34
they are coming close to the shelter so I went to the tent where I
12:39
was living for 3 months and I told my sister listen you have to come with me
12:46
back your luggage and we will go to ra went out through the gates there was a
12:51
clashes behind us there was like bulldozers Israeli bulldozers Israeli
12:57
tanks and and they open fire on people even like sniping shots and it was like
13:04
above our heads so I told her to run as much as she can and yes we went like
13:11
from the same way I came and we directly move to
13:20
Rafa it become like night and we went through this road and
13:25
it was near to the Border I saw the Egyptian side and I was saying you know
13:32
this is the line between Egypt and Gaza it was so painful for me to see that
13:38
only like 5 m like it's a w like 5 m and this part is safe no Earth strikes
13:46
nothing they are having their own country and there was lights actually
13:51
there were lots of lights and this is was very painful for me to feel like you are living all the
13:58
days inside the dark you are living inside Darkness
14:07
yeah does it make you angry at Egypt given that it could theoretically open
14:13
the border right allow people into safety into the
14:19
light no why should I be angry on them I mean they could let people in
14:27
right but okay hey if I'm in your home and I came to your
14:32
home this is your prorities if I came without permission
14:37
would you allow for me right I'm not defending them but this is their own country okay we are under War but at
14:45
least we have the right to have our own State our own country so you're saying basically Egypt
14:52
has the right not to let people in because people living in Gaza aren't part of
14:57
Egypt we are part of Palestine okay we are not
15:03
part of egyp we are not playing to Egypt we are not going to live in Egypt we have our own country we want to be there
15:09
here why should we live to another country if we want to spend a vacation there okay let's go to Egypt all of us
15:16
but this is our country we have to stay in our country as they live in their country we have the right to live in our
15:22
country learn here work here build our country if we live Gaza who will it stay
15:32
here and what did you think when you saw that news about a potential invasion of
15:40
Rafa uh I have no other place to go honestly I'm I don't have any place
15:47
this is the last place that I can evacuate to I don't have any other place to go like I don't have like all my
15:53
friends houses they are full of people or my relatives even so I'm running out
15:59
of places yeah this is the last option that we have does it
16:06
feel a little bit like the end of things like the end of what's happening the end
16:13
of the war maybe I hope so well if it can be the end I hope
16:19
so but not with the ground Invasion please
16:26
stop someone tell them to not to do this I'm just like I'm expressing my
16:36
feeling got the back in October when the war first started we spoke to a woman
16:41
who was fleeing from the north and she said it some point in our conversation what do they want why don't
16:48
they just tell us what they want do they want to just throw us into the sea like
16:55
just be honest and and don't keep us in all of this pain tell us us what you want to do with us does that resonate
17:02
with you at all yeah it's a game like we are playing a game go there hide there don't go
17:10
there it's not a safe place we are asking the same question again like tell
17:15
us to stay in this place and don't come for me you are fighting with a
17:22
group okay what is my fault it's not my fault just AO the
17:28
civilians just avoid Us by that group you mean Hamas yes and you're fighting is with
17:36
them and what if the Israelis contention that Hamas is in fact hiding among civilians that that is a
17:44
tactic I know that that you are going to say this questions I know I've been
17:49
asked like many times this questions but at least try to avoid
17:56
us you are killing us yeah we are following like the people
18:02
the normal people the Civ they are following their orders but whenever you are going to a saer place the fighting
18:11
is following you that's the game you're talking
18:17
about yeah it's a game like it's a game you said it's a saer BL then the next day you
18:23
are attacking the safe place you said it's a safey place I'm not saying it's
18:28
the saf place you said go there to avoid the civilians but you came to the safe
18:33
place how can I believe you what to
18:43
do but what will you do will you try to
18:48
run if you have to would you tell me where to run tell me just
18:56
tell me where to go [Music]
19:09
we'll be right [Music]
19:20
back the isra military says it's rescued two of the hostages abducted by Hamas
19:27
during a rain in Rafa overnight dozens of Palestinians were reported to have
19:33
been killed in the early hours of Monday Israel's offensive in Rafa looks set to
19:39
continue IDF appears poised to expand its ground war further south where
19:44
thousands of civilians have led for safety safe what does the word even mean
19:49
in Gaza [Music] today actually it's obvious that we are
19:56
not dead because what happened last night but there is no other place to go
20:02
there is no other place to leave we don't know what shall we
20:07
do the day after an Israeli military raid into Rafa we talked to Hussein AA
20:13
he'd been living in Rafa for about 3 weeks starting from my house the area at
20:18
Gaza City to another neighborhood another neighborhood another Governor to
20:24
another governor and finally here in Hussein had been placed four times
20:29
since the War Began and in Rafa he' rented a house that was under construction without windows or doors
20:36
for his wife and three children to live in actually this is my kids next to me
20:45
my eldest daughter Le 9 years old my son mahm 6 years old and then 16 months 16
20:54
months old yep oh Hussein tell me what are you doing for
21:01
food now what are you eating actually we are in suffering for
21:08
every basic need for water because each day you are going to fill the water you
21:14
are going to carry kind of gallons for path for
21:19
everything uh there is huge lack of gas cooking gas so people are depending on
21:28
wood Starting Fire for cooking what do they cook actually actually I I get
21:34
canned food beans uh canned meat Etc and
21:40
all the people are just eating the canned food actually and the best thing we are facing for from my perspective
21:48
during the war actually I lost around 30 kilos it's the only good thing happened
21:54
to me you lost 30 kilos that's that's a lot of weight to
22:00
lose yeah I needed to lose it actually and it's it's it's the only good thing
22:06
happened to me oh
22:17
husin hi my goodness it's very difficult to get
22:22
through yes thank God there is kind of connection right now even if it's very
22:29
hard to call anyone if basic need
22:36
is there's a challenge actually it sounds like there's honking
22:43
in the background who saying what is that where are you right now actually right now I'm down on the
22:52
street a lot of clouds here imagine there is more than million people are
22:57
here this small City at the border with Egypt what does it look like it's dark
23:05
and a lot of crowds of people just walking trying to find food find water
23:13
just walking around us with no Direction with no destination for them actually I
23:20
see the people like Z walking on the street they are walking
23:27
in a way they are looking like not being
23:34
alive you know just undescribable actually because
23:39
their faces doesn't show like they look like
23:46
just if they are lost thousands of people all of them are lost in
23:52
the yeah are you lost yeah for sure I'm lost because I
23:59
don't know what's going to happen I don't know what shall I do you know it
24:04
was a very scary night last night yeah a lot of bombardment and Shilling started
24:11
a lot of shooting we were sleep actually and all of us woke up due to the sound
24:18
the house was shaking due to the boming and my son and daughter were scaming and
24:29
asking me for hugging them and hiding them and I just hugged them and found
24:36
the most safe place which is near the St and we just set in there playing to be
24:42
alive to be safe and all of us were scared to be shot or be bomed for no
24:52
reason the morning I got to go outside to get kind of the grocery for the house
24:59
and my daughter said to me we don't need to eat just to stay with us it's very
25:06
dangerous to get outside don't move yeah and I convinced her that I'm
25:13
I'm big man I can manage myself and we got to eat and I'm gonna be back don't
25:20
worry about me just be a live here and listen to your
25:26
mommy yeah and did you find food yeah I went
25:34
to a shelter next to and I found tomato
25:40
I bought can meat I bought the spaget and went back to the home and did the
25:49
B because it was a very difficult a friend told me that there were more than
25:56
70 people are killed in ra last night so
26:02
I'm thinking that it could be off any
26:07
day we should live the best lives we can
26:14
live and enjoy every second and a minute as much as we
26:21
can so I got to prepare something special for
26:26
them so you got the spaghetti
26:31

26:37
before all of this started before October 7th tell me a little bit about
26:46
you actually I was very busy I just finished building my house
26:56
which was suppos to move into on the 7th of October oh wow B the fiture and
27:06
everything and it was to receive the furniture on 7th of October oh my
27:11

27:19
destroyed actually it took me around two years to finish it I got to design every
27:28
corner with the my wife what colors to use what materials to
27:34
use and actually it was very beautiful
27:39
actually we did a great kitchen and open kitchen to the living room and we had a
27:48
big balcony and we we were thinking that this big balcony would be place to sit
27:56
in drinking coffee and tea and leaving fresh
28:01
air and [Applause]
28:12
uh what not talking
28:19
about nothing
28:26
oh sorry for that are you
28:33
okay alhamdulillah yeah I'm
28:39
fine what are you doing now where are you going to go I'm just
28:45
walking right now like a
28:52
z thank God that it's dark no one can see the tears on my
29:04
actually for me at least I got money I can't buy food I got a roof above me
29:11
yeah I'm not yeah but imagine the other people are sleeping on the streets
29:19
sleeping on tents sleeping by the seashore here they got no toilet they
29:26
got no B SS and it's not alive for humans
29:33
actually a lot of diseases a lot of mantion MH and the people are really
29:41
suffering here they are really suffering it's inhuman what we are living in and
29:48
we did nothing not our fault we did nothing we are just normal people just
29:56
trying to live our Liv why are we here why this is
30:01
happening to us sometimes I I
30:07
think my kids should be at school should be
30:13
studying are they going to join schools again there will be
30:19
schools there to live normal life you know at the beginning I tried
30:27
to convin my children that we are doing kind of camping and my daughter just
30:33
kept to tell me that no it's not camping if it's camping at least we should have
30:40
living bags how is it going to be camping people do cing at the forest but
30:46
there is no Forest we should start fire and we need marshmallow to do on fire
30:52
and there is nothing to do we are just living on the street it's not
30:58
camping actually I don't get the proper answer for her and I just said to her
31:04
that you should enjoy your time with your family at least we are all together
31:10
and we are surviving yeah it's kind of special experience we are living
31:15
together and you should enjoy [Music]
31:24
it do you think they'll remember this hin are you worried they'll remember
31:30
this it's just called in their M and won't disappear
31:36
actually are you hopeful that your 16-month-old might not remember
31:44
this hope so maybe he he won't remember it but I guess that he is going to live
31:51
its effect on his life because why his family got no house
32:00
there is no proper life for him nor for
32:05
any child to live in there is nothing and
32:11
actually when I see the pictures and the videos of God we used to live it's
32:19
totally destroyed so where is he going to live it's not a proper place to live in
32:27
and it will affect him deeply affect him living in such D
32:33
situation
32:38
yeah it's their childhood it's it's my life it's our
32:44
lives which is joing from
32:52
us what does that feel like no no
32:57
power nothing no choices we don't know what to do this didn't declare any safe place to
33:06
go to you know so we are just sitting here waiting
33:15
for our
33:21
destiny could be good we don't know maybe we are ad we
33:27
we don't know it's our destiny it's our
33:33
[Music]
33:53
F sleeping bag can't
34:04
flash fish
34:14
[Music]
34:25
marshmallow
34:32
I just remember the sil questions we use to play in our childhood who will you
34:38
choose to save when never imagine that we can be in a real
34:46
situation where we got to choose unfortunately I can't save
34:55
anyone I want only can try to save one two three at
35:03
maximum now I'm thinking about evacuating my kids to save them from the
35:10
hell we are living in a day after we spoke to Hussein he sent a voice memo saying that he was
35:17
trying to decide whether to get his family out of Gaza through Egypt the
35:22
border is officially closed but gazin say that with enough money you can get people
35:27
out evacuating one person from
35:33
Gaza cost around [Music]
35:44
$5,000 like it's very hard to decide and I cannot make a
35:51
decision to try to evacuate my kids so
35:57
they can be safe they can go to schools but they are going to be far
36:04
away from me which I don't know if I can
36:10
[Music] handle or all of us just can stay here
36:18
together facing the same [Music]
36:25
disty really hard to take a
36:33
decision so difficult would you do
36:40
that I don't think so why why would you not
36:45
leave first of all because of my daughter and
36:50
then I'm so attached to this land actually I love Gaza
36:58
but even to save your own life my daughter's life is more
37:04
important in my life yeah I will not be comfortable
37:12
