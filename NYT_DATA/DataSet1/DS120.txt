The Failed Promise of Police Body Cameras



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina tavernes and this is the
0:07
[Music]
0:13
daily a decade ago police departments across the country began requiring
0:18
officers to wear body cameras it was the single biggest change to come out of the
0:23
police Reform movement a piece of technology that promised accountability in
0:28
policing today the Times magazine and the News organization propublica
0:35
investigate what happened with that reform and why it has not lived up to its
0:40
promise I spoke with prop publicas Eric
0:47
umansky it's Monday January [Music]
Eric Umansky
0:54
29th so Eric most of us have gotten pretty used to the idea that police officers wear body cameras on the job
1:01
right it's it's part of the uniform at this point essentially and it was one of the big things to come out of the police
1:07
Reform movement over the last decade and activist had a lot of Hope for these things you are an investigative reporter
1:14
and you have been looking into body cameras and the fate of body cameras as a reform when did you start becoming
1:22
curious about them so was in early 2023 January actually there was a
1:28
particularly horrific police killing in Memphis it was a young man named Tyrie
1:34
Nicholls and police had beaten him to death and there was footage of it and
1:42
the footage came out and I was reading about it and there was this one sentence in the story and the sentence in the
1:48
story said that the officers were beating him with their body warn cameras
1:55
on and they knew that their cameras were on and it just stopped me I thought how
2:01
can it be that officers would beat somebody to death knowing it was being
2:09
recorded right this camera was a device supposedly to stop misconduct and here was this misconduct the camera was
2:15
rolling and no one seemed to really care yeah that was remarkable to me and it
2:21
was also a question of how was this big reform this huge it was really the
2:27
biggest changing in policing I think it's fair to say in a generation how did it play out across the country did the
2:34
promise of transparency and accountability you know was it really delivered okay so before we get to what
2:40
happened with that reform remind us how body cameras first came into use in the US how long have they been around so
2:47
body cams first became popular about a decade ago in the United States and it
2:53
was a very specific moment and that was the police killing in Ferguson Missouri
2:59
of a teenager named Michael Brown that killing there was no recording of it
3:05
there was enormous disputes about what happened in the moments before he was shot and the killing set off the first
3:13
Nationwide black lives matters protests good morning chairman morning and in
3:19
response to that my name is Les mpen the mother of Michael Brown Michael Brown's
3:25
own mother called for police to be equipped with body worn cameras on
3:31
August 9th there was no recorded account of my son's last moments in
3:36
life I still do not have closure or the solid truth of what
3:41
really happened that day please let police want body cameras be a Voice of
3:47
Truth and transparency in Missouri communities thank
3:55
you so then bodyw warn cameras began spreading incredibly quickly around around the country the justice
4:01
department announced 20 million in Grants to get body cams on Cops Nationwide President Obama endorse them
4:08
and put Federal money toward them part of the reason this time will be different is because uh the president of
4:13
the United States uh is deeply invested in making sure that this time is
4:18
made and it was really an idea that appealed across the political aisle this
4:24
is going to strengthen the people of South Carolina this is going to strengthen law enforcement Nikki Haley
4:29
then the governor of South Carolina became the first governor in the country to require officers to wear body warn
4:37
cameras and you know the notion behind all of this was that you would have footage that would do actually kind of a
4:44
whole variety of things one is that there would be transparency so that community members could see for
4:50
themselves what officers were doing and were not doing then you also have the
4:57
accountability if officers were engaged in misconduct that they would suffer some consequences for it and then the
5:05
third thing was really the kind of great hope which is that if officers knew they were being recorded they wouldn't engage
5:12
in misconduct in the first place that you know they wouldn't beat people or or shoot people unnecessarily that was the
5:19
hope behind all of
New York City
5:25
it right and as you said despite all of this promise there's this Gap Gathering evidence that cameras are not actually
5:31
delivering any real reform even after they'd been adopted all over the country as they had so Eric where did you start
5:38
to answer the question of what's going wrong here so I decided to look at New York City and there are a couple reasons
5:44
that I did that one the NYPD is the world's largest police department and
5:51
what the NYPD does other police departments around the country follow so that's
5:57
incredibly important and then on top of that there was this really interesting dynamic in New York which is that a
6:03
federal judge actually ordered the NYPD to begin using cameras in response
6:11
to problematic policing and when did police in the city actually start
6:17
wearing them like when was the policy implemented and what happened when they did so in
6:23
2017 the then Mayor DeBlasio and the then police chief gave press conference
6:30
in which they said this is the first day of the era of body warn cameras and that
6:36
means we are going on a pathway of transparency and accountability we are
6:43
rebuilding trust between the community and police and it is a new day for
6:48
accountability and transparency mark my words this is going to make us safer and
6:54
so just a few months after that press conference and all those promises the
7:00
first killing by police officers in New York City is captured on a body warn
7:06
camera and all those promises are put to the test so police got a call to check in on
7:14
a young man named Miguel Richards 31 years old Jamaican College exchange
7:20
student lived in the Bronx and his landlord hadn't heard from him in a
7:26
while and so the police officers show up and after 15 minutes they shot him to
7:33
death God and a week later police decide
7:38
to disclose some of the [Music]
Bodycam Footage
7:48
footage and what is the footage they release show officers walk into this apartment
7:56
guys back up back up back the door find him in the far corner of his bedroom
8:02
with dark sunglasses on standing completely rigid do you see me speak to
8:08
me are you seeing me right now I see you not moving at all and Ricardo dude I see
8:14
that knife in your hand he's holding a small knife next to his side it's not worth it put the knife down and walk out
8:22
here with your hands in the end and they tell him to drop the knife and he
8:29
doesn't do so this is not going to end well for you if you don't put that down he doesn't respond at all he he's seems
8:35
to be basically catatonic put that knife down you hear me put that knife on the
8:40
floor drop it and over the course of 15 minutes the officers get
8:47
increasingly concerned in part they worried that he had a gun that they couldn't see his other hand you
8:53
understand you were a second away from getting shot if you don't tell what's in your other hand let me see where the other hand is and another officer comes
9:01
with a taser I'll advise Central just have a unit with a taser come over here please but before the officer with a
9:07
taser can even use it he's got a knife and a and a Gun there's a gun gun dude
9:12
drop it one of the other officers decides to fire his gun want to take
9:19
yeah just go yeah just go he's might never G just hit
9:28
him they fire 16 times 16 times yeah
9:33
they fire at him 16 times get back get back you're right and
9:40
they kill him wow and that's where the footage the
9:46
police released
9:55
[Music] ends
What Did People Think
10:03
and what did people think once that was made public once the footage was made public so the police commissioner in an
10:10
accompanying internal message said sometimes the use of deadly force is
10:17
inevitable and that the officers did the right thing and as part of the message
10:23
he said you know it reflects that all officers show tremendous restraint
10:31
but some people noticed the police had not actually released the full footage
10:37
what they had released was a compilation from a few videos and it wasn't the full
10:43
recording of what happened and so a public interest lawyer
10:49
soon after the shooting actually filed a public records request for the full
10:56
footage the police department rejected her request she kept pushing and went
11:03
back and forth with the NYPD for well over a year and then a judge finally
11:10
ordered the police department to hand over the full footage what did it
What Did It Show
11:19
show holy [Music] [ __ ] the full footage showed officers
11:27
walking over his limp body he's [ __ ] C you're not hit are you anybody
11:34
hit one of them said he's still alive he's still
11:43
alive none of the officers who were initially there gave him any medical Aid
11:49
got start working on him and Richard's lay bleeding on the ground for more than
11:55
3 minutes where is there's a gun somewhere we'll find it's just he's CU just and
12:02
one thing the video shows is officers looking for a gun but there was no real gun the
12:10
officers later found a toy gun in his room had something in his hand like a laser point point I don't know if it was
12:17
a gun or not and actually help had been seconds away other specially trained
12:24
officers were at the scene and were actually walking up the stairs when the
12:32
officers decided to shoot where there was no urgency to do
The New Picture
12:42
so so this new footage shows a much more complicated picture and one that calls
12:47
into question the behavior that the police commissioner previously said was okay yeah the the footage and the
12:54
internal investigation together show a really different uh picture in fact
12:59
actually the nypd's investigators concluded that Richards had not been a
13:05
danger to anyone that he was quote unquote contained and the investigators had
13:12
recommended punishing the officers for their conduct and then the police
13:18
commissioner had decided to just simply ignore
What This Means
13:24
them so Eric this seems to kind of fly in the face of what people working on police reform had hoped right that the
13:30
footage from these cameras would be a clear window into what happened and in this shooting the initial footage did
13:36
not tell us the full story what do you make of this so I think fundamentally
13:42
what this tells us is that having a little black box on officers chest recording everything they do isn't
13:50
enough really you need to address a more fundamental issue of who controls the
13:57
footage that's being recorded recorded on those [Music]
14:06
cameras we'll be right
14:15
[Music] back so Eric we just talked about the
Who Controls the Footage
14:22
first killing caught on camera in New York City and you told me that the footage the police released really
14:28
didn't show the whole story and the real lesson from that is it's about who
14:33
controls the footage so in the case of New York who does actually control the footage I mean looks like it's the
14:39
police right right it's very much the police and the reason for that is not
14:45
that somebody made a proactive choice to give the police control it's that really
14:50
the police in New York have been left by and large to police themselves and so
14:57
when bodyw warn cameras came along it really just sort of as a default made
15:02
sense for the police to have the power to decide what is recorded what is done
15:09
with those recordings what is released and when and what's the argument for the police department having complete
15:16
discretion over who sees the footage I mean how does the police department in New York talk about this how do they
15:21
justify that so what the police department typically says is that there
15:28
are privacy concerns and you know there are legitimate privacy concerns for example
15:34
if there's footage of somebody in their home and perhaps they're unclothed or
15:41
there's a minor there they also typically site there being an ongoing
15:48
investigation and you know one of the issues is well that ongoing
15:53
investigation can take well over a year ongoing investigation in other words we
16:00
really can't tell you anything because it might actually affect the outcome of this legal process that we have underway
16:07
yeah so you know I've spoken to a number of prosecutors and people in law enforcement about that specific issue
16:15
and there are legitimate reasons to hold off for some period of time you know
16:21
because of the logic if you have somebody who's involved in an incident you perhaps don't want them seeing
16:27
footage so that they can figure out what you know right but that's not a reason
16:33
to withhold something for a year what people told me is that should be
16:38
something that could be dealt with in a few days in a small period of time and
16:45
that particularly in something like police shootings it has to be balanced against the significant public interest
16:52
in disclosure in you know building trust between police and the community okay so
16:58
the police officers have to use these body cameras but the police department doesn't have to share what these cameras
17:03
record is there no check on the police department so there is a check it's a
17:09
civilian oversight board whose job it is to investigate allegations of misconduct
17:17
by the police the problem is that it is deeply powerless just to take an example
17:25
it has no ability to access footage from bodyw warn cameras themselves a former
17:31
head of this oversight board described it to me as a mother mayi process they
17:37
need to go to the NYPD and say please can we have this footage and you know
17:43
sometimes the NYPD gives it and sometimes they don't so this seems like a pretty big thing to leave out if
17:50
you're trying to do a police reform it is and frankly what I've found is that
17:55
the NYPD has use that power to Monkey Wrench
18:01
the process just to give you a couple of examples of that the NYPD would
18:07
frequently tell the oversight board that it didn't have footage of one incident or another only for the oversight board
18:15
to later discover that video existed wow and then the
18:20
NYPD also would withhold footage of shootings and other serious incidents
18:27
for often well over a year and that didn't just sort of slow down the
18:34
investigative process it actually cut it off because in New York there's a rule
18:41
that discipline cases must happen within 18 months of an incident and so when the
18:47
NYPD withholds footage it's not simply a transparency issue what it means is that
18:52
the civilian oversight board effectively can't investigate and do it its job it
18:59
has no ability to even recommend punishment against officers and what
19:05
that means is that even though there are cameras uh there can be no accountability which was the whole point
19:11
of cameras to begin with okay so cameras were meant really as a defense against
19:18
police misconduct but police in New York don't want that misconduct to have to be
19:24
scrutinized or have one of their own punished and because the police are the only ones with their hands on the button
19:31
so to speak it turns out to be kind of a useless tool right these cameras at least in New York when you were doing
19:38
your reporting did you find any place doing it differently any place where it
19:43
actually was working so yeah I spent some time looking for exactly that and I
19:51
ended up in a place that that I have to say surprised me and that's Chicago really I mean I don't generally think of
19:57
Chicago as like a parag of policing Chicago is certainly not a paragon of policing you're absolutely right about
20:03
that it has a long and frankly brutal record of policing over many decades but
20:10
Chicago went through some enormous changes about actually a decade ago and
20:17
that's after police shot and killed a 17-year-old named lacoin McDonald in
20:25
2014 so at the time there was a shooting every five days in Chicago of primarily
20:33
black male residents by police and the shooting of lacoin McDonald was
20:39
initially treated as another one of those it's not a big story then a
20:44
whistleblower tipped off a local Advocate and journalist that there was
20:50
dash cam footage of what happened and that what it showed was very different
20:57
than the initial accounts the local Advocate said that what it showed was
21:02
that lacoin McDonald had been shot 16 times it was essentially an execution
21:08
the city had fought for nearly a year against that footage becoming public and
21:14
when the footage came out as a result of a judge's
21:20
order the consequences were cataclysmic the mayor of Chicago has
21:26
fired the city's Top Cop the police chief was forced out his departure comes
21:31
a week after one of his police officers was charged with the murder of a black teenager there was a federal
21:38
investigation accusations of a coverup have followed the mayor since the video was
21:43
[Music] released and the mayor at the time
21:50
decided not to run again so the The Fallout both from The
21:56
Killing but also from the cover up led to intense pressure on the city for
22:02
major reform and as a result ultimately Chicago was forced to reimagine police
Reform in Chicago
22:14
oversight and what changes emerged after the Scandal what happened what did Chicago do so just to take some examples
22:23
they dissolved their ineffectual civilian oversight agency and they
22:30
created a a new one and as part of this process remember you know the footage
22:35
had been so critical in lacoin McDonald's case and so they put
22:41
disclosure of footage at the center of all of this the city committed to
22:47
disclosing footage from shootings on a regular basis they said they would do so within two months of a shooting but just
22:55
as critically what they said was it would wouldn't be the police who is ultimately in control of the footage and
23:04
of what and when that is released what they did was the new civilian oversight
23:10
agency had the ability to get footage itself it didn't have to you know send a
23:16
very nice letter to the Chicago Police Department asking for footage it was not mother mayi of New York right they
23:23
didn't have to do that they literally have logins to the system wow so that they can pull footage themselves and
23:31
then there's this second key component of it which is that it's that agency and
23:36
not the police department that has the authority to disclose the footage
23:43
publicly and that is what they have done wow so a very different scenario from
23:49
New York and going back to the earlier part of our conversation this would seem to be a real way to make cameras the
23:57
tool that activist just imagine that they would be right by spreading around the power to control the footage to
24:02
other things like these civilian boards taking the Monopoly away from the police department so Eric what is the effect of
24:09
this reform on the numbers of police shootings in the city has there been a change in the numbers since it was
24:16
implemented so in Chicago in the days since laquan McDonald and all of these
24:22
changes have been implemented and you know I should say that there were a enormous number of changes in Chicago
24:29
wasn't simply cameras but there have been real significant measurable
24:35
critical changes so police shootings have dropped by roughly half you know
24:42
before I had said that there was one every five days last year there were 22
24:48
in all of last year wow that's a big drop yeah it's a significant drop and it's not the only drop use of force has
24:56
also gone down by by officers by about a third and so you see real significant
25:04
changes in Chicago and you know lots of folks I spoke with there emphasized
25:09
things are not perfect there you still have officers frequently not turning their cameras on when they should and
25:17
you still have the police department trying to create an narrative for
25:23
example around shootings but it's much more difficult for them now that there's
25:30
a third party that's releasing all the footage so Eric we have two cities that
25:37
look pretty different in terms of their approach to reform right so across the
25:44
United States are there more New Yorks or more Chicago which is typical so New
25:51
York is typical you know we actually found that even in police shootings the
25:56
most extreme use of force that police can engage in police are more often than not not
26:04
releasing footage so you really have lots of places looking like New York you
26:10
know I've been reporting on this issue for basically a year and throughout it
26:16
I've been asking um can you tell me of an instance where the police are not in
26:21
charge of disclosing footage and throughout it all I could only find one
26:27
and that's Chicago so how applicable is Chicago to the rest of the country Eric
26:33
I mean you said it's singular now but could it be some sort of model in the
26:39
future yeah so I think it could be I mean there's no natural law that says
26:45
there must be weak civilian oversight of policing in the United
26:52
States what it requires frankly is political will on behalf of Mayor and
26:58
other local leaders to say that this way isn't working and that there is actually
27:03
another way to do things what happened in Chicago you know it took a horrific
27:08
Scandal to force change but there's no reason there has to be a horrific scandal in every city I mean it's we as
27:17
taxpayers who are paying for this technology and it can be useful it can be put to good use and it can make a
27:24
[Music] difference
27:29
Eric thank you thank
27:38
you we'll be right
27:52
back here's what else you should know today on Sunday three American soldiers
27:57
were killed and 255 were injured in a drone strike in Jordan President Biden
28:03
said in a statement that an iran-backed militia had carried out the strike which took place on an army base near the
28:09
Syrian border the deaths will put more pressure on Biden to respond more forcefully in the Middle East as the war
28:16
in Gaza threatens to spread and the United nations's highest
28:22
Court ruled that Israel must take action to prevent acts of genocide by it forces
28:27
in the Gaza Strip however the court stopped short of calling on Jerusalem to
28:33
stop its military campaign the ruling which was preliminary had elements that each side could embrace the court
28:40
ultimately allowed the genocide case to proceed which will likely keep Israel under International scrutiny for years
28:46
to come finally former president Donald Trump was ordered by a Manhattan jury to
28:54
pay $83 million to the writer egene Carol for defaming her in 2019 after she
29:01
accused him of a decades old rape it was Trump's second trial in Carol's case she
29:07
was awarded $5 million last spring after a jury found Trump had sexually abused
29:12
her in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid 1990s Carol's lawyers had argued that a
29:19
large award was necessary to stop Trump from continuing to attack
