Trump's Abortion Dilemma


0:00
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:02
tavernes and this is the
0:05
[Music]
0:11
daily by the time his first term was
0:14
over Donald Trump had cemented his place
0:17
as the most anti-abortion president in
0:19
US history now facing political blowback
0:24
he's trying to change that
0:26
reputation today my colleague AER on
0:31
whether Trump's election year pivot can
0:35

0:48
10th Lisa welcome back to the show
0:51
thanks for having me so Lisa this week
0:55
Donald Trump weighed in on one of the
0:56
most contentious American social issues
0:59
of our time and one that has of course
1:01
been right at the center of American
1:03
politics and that is abortion this is a
1:06
topic you know very deeply and very well
1:10
so we wanted to have you on the show to
1:12
talk about what Trump said and what it
1:15
means for the presidential campaign well
1:18
this was a really anticipated statement
1:20
Trump in his classic trumpian way had
1:22
been sort of teasing it that he was
1:24
going to come out with where he stood on
1:25
abortion and so he comes out with this
1:28
statement bright and early Monday
1:29
morning
1:30
and he had three main points that he
1:32
really ran through in his remarks which
1:34
were posted on his social media Network
1:36
Tru social under my leadership the
Trumps Statement
1:39
Republican party will always support the
1:41
creation of strong thriving and healthy
1:44
American families he starts out by
1:47
talking about the Republican Party being
1:48
the party of families and this was
1:50
really a way to talk about IVF which of
1:53
course are the fertility treatments and
1:55
that became a major topic of the
1:57
national conversation after Alabama had
2:00
a Court ruling that would have really
2:01
limited access to those treatments I
2:03
strongly support the availability of IVF
2:06
for couples who are trying to have a
2:08
precious baby what could be more
2:10
beautiful or better than that today I'm
2:13
pleas there's very few things that the
2:14
country is Unified around right now and
2:17
support for IVF is one of them so Trump
2:20
comes out and says that he too supports
2:22
those treatments he believes access to
2:24
them should be kept open and free so
2:27
that was his first point then many
2:29
people have asked me what my position is
2:32
on abortion and abortion rights he moves
2:35
into the abortion part of his remarks
2:38
especially since I was probably the
2:39
person responsible for the ending of
2:41
something that and the first thing he
2:43
does is take credit for ending Rie Wade
2:47
which is of course the decision that
2:49
created a constitutional right to
2:50
abortion I want to thank the six
2:52
justices Chief Justice John Roberts
2:55
Clarence Thomas Samuel Alo Brett kavanau
2:59
Amy Tony Barrett and Neil Gorsuch
3:02
incredible people and then he moves to
3:05
what he sees as his future thoughts
3:07
where the country should go in this new
3:09
post row ERA this 50-year battle over
3:12
roie Wade took it out of the federal
3:15
hands and brought it into the hearts
3:17
minds and vote of the people in each
3:19
state was really something and what he
3:22
basically says is that it should be left
3:24
to the States now it's up to the states
3:26
to do the right thing like Ronald Reagan
3:28
I am strongly in favor of exceptions for
3:31
rape incest and life of the mother you
3:34
must follow your heart of this issue but
3:36
he expresses support that bans should
3:38
include exemptions for rape incest in
3:41
the life of the mother if a woman falls
3:43
into any of those three categories she
3:45
should be allowed to get an abortion at
3:47
the end of the day it's all about will
3:50
of the people that's where we are right
3:52
now and that's what we want the will of
3:54
the people but the most striking thing
The 15 Week Federal Ban
3:56
about this four-minute video was perhaps
3:58
the issue that he didn't mention at all
4:00
the issue he left out which is this
4:02
question of a 15-week federal ban
4:05
practically since the fall of row since
4:07
the do's case overturn that right the
4:10
anti-abortion movement has been pushing
4:12
to get Republicans to line up behind
4:14
this idea of a 15we federal ban
4:17
effectively a restriction that would
4:19
cover the entire country so in the 30 or
4:22
so states that allow abortion past that
4:25
point in pregnancy they would no longer
4:27
be allowed to do that all abortion
4:29
across the country would be criminalized
4:31
after 15 weeks so huge change for blue
4:34
States all over the place a huge change
4:36
for blue States some swing States even
4:39
some more conservative states that
4:40
haven't passed these more restrictive
4:43
total
4:44
bans Trump has been wishy-washy on the
4:47
issue for two years or so he's sort of
4:49
dangled that maybe he would get behind
4:51
this push and support a 15we federal ban
4:54
but he never quite committed to it and
4:56
what we see in this video is that he's
4:59
still not committing to it he doesn't
5:01
say if such legislation came to his desk
5:04
he doesn't say whether he would sign it
5:06
but what the anti-abortion movement
5:07
hears in this is that he will not be
5:10
advocating for this policy so he's in
5:13
essence pulling away from what the
5:16
mainstream of the anti-abortion movement
5:18
wants right this Federal ban but how
5:21
should we understand what he's doing
5:24
here like what's he up to well what he's
5:27
trying to do is win the election that's
5:29
what trying to do here I mean abortion
5:31
is a hugely important issue this race
5:34
Democrats hope it will be the issue that
5:36
could Define and decide this election
5:39
since the right to an abortion was
5:40
overturned it transformed American
5:43
politics in some ways it created this
5:45
Coalition of pro-abortion Rights voters
5:48
who have turned out for Democrats again
5:50
and again they've turned out in the
5:51
midterms they've turned out in small
5:53
sort of State Legislative elections
5:55
they've turned out in gubernatorial
5:57
races in 2023 and Trump knows that and
6:00
so what we're seeing him do is to try to
6:03
find a path through this issue that he
6:05
believes has been damaging to
6:07
Republicans and what he's attempting to
6:10
do with this statement is sort of defang
6:13
some of the democratic power some of
6:15
this energizing force that abortion
6:17
rights has become for Democrats in
6:19
American politics but that's a pretty
6:21
sharp pivot right I mean this is the
6:24
president who takes credit for
6:25
overturning row after all and now he's
6:27
trying to tack back to the middle
6:30
it is a pivot but it's not all that
6:32
surprising of one this is a politician
6:34
who unlike probably anyone else in
6:37
American public life has taken just
6:38
about every position on abortion someone
6:41
could have throughout his
Partial Birth Abortion
6:43
[Music]
6:45
career would president Trump ban partial
6:48
birth abortion well look I'm I'm very
6:51
pro-choice I hate the concept of
6:54
abortion when he first started flirting
6:56
with the presidential run back in the
6:58
late '90s he went on TV and said he was
7:01
very pro-choice but you would not ban it
7:04
no or ban partial birth of no I would I
7:06
would I am I am pro-choice in every
7:08
respect and as far as it goes but I just
7:11
hate
7:14
it just very
7:17
briefly I'm
7:21
prolife a decade or so later he became
7:24
pro-life before an audience of
7:26
conservatives uh I've evolved on many
7:28
issues over the years years and you know
7:30
who else has is Ronald Reagan evolved on
7:32
many issues and I am Pro lifee and if
7:35
you look at and then in 2016 when he ran
7:38
he was never the candidate of the
7:41
anti-abortion crowd they didn't trust
7:42
him they knew how he had moved on their
7:44
issue many of them voted for other
7:47
candidates but he won over the rank and
7:50
file Conservative Christian voters and
7:52
they extracted during that campaign a
7:55
series of promises from him I am
7:58
pro-life and I will be appointing
8:00
pro-life judges I would think most
8:02
significantly was that he would appoint
8:04
what he called pro-life judges do you
8:06
want to see the court overturn well if
8:09
we put another two or perhaps three
8:11
justices on that's really what's going
8:13
to be H that's will happen and that'll
8:16
happen automatically in my opinion
8:18
because I am putting pro-life justices
8:20
on the
8:24
court and he got elected and he changed
Trumps Legacy
8:28
the composition of the Court to a more
8:30
socially conservative bent for a
8:32
generation he worked to defund Planned
8:34
Parenthood and by the time he ran again
8:37
in 2020 the anti-abortion movement was
8:40
calling him the most pro-life president
8:42
in history and he didn't win but he
8:45
turned out millions of Christian
8:47
conservative voters behind him right and
8:49
so Trump leaves office in 2021 and then
8:52
a year later all of those appointments
8:54
he made to the court give the
8:56
anti-abortion movement really its
8:58
biggest win in generation
9:00
the overturning of roie Wade his promise
9:02
to appoint those pro-life judges as he
9:04
put it bears fruit in a massive way in a
9:07
way that outpaced even what the
9:09
anti-abortion movement had hoped for
9:11
when they first extracted those promises
9:13
for Trump back in
9:14
2016 but what they didn't see coming on
9:18
either side of the abortion debate was
9:20
how quickly the politics would
9:22
transform that's when we saw this
9:24
historically energizing issue for
9:26
Republicans become really a much more
9:28
motivating issue for Democrats and
Politics
9:32
Independence I think the Republicans
9:34
speak very inarticulately about this
9:37
subject and when Trump saw those
9:39
politics change he began criticizing the
9:42
anti-abortion movement and their leaders
9:44
I watch some of them without the
9:47
exceptions etc etc I said you other than
9:50
certain parts of the country you can't
9:53
you're not going to win on this issue
9:54
but you will win as pushing for
9:56
restrictions that were really just he
9:58
felt a little bit too harsh he blamed
10:01
them for Republican defeats in the 2022
10:04
midterms and so he expressed some views
10:07
that this was an issue abortion that
10:10
even though he was happy to take credit
10:12
for putting those justices in who
10:14
overturned row that the politics of this
10:16
issue how it All Shook out in the post
10:19
row world was hurting Republicans and
10:21
was a political loser so in other words
10:24
throughout his career he's followed the
10:26
political wins on abortion exactly for
10:29
the anti-abortion movement this is a
10:31
spiritual Quest the effort to end
10:33
abortion is an effort to write what they
10:35
see as a moral wrong in American life
10:38
for Trump like so many things this is
10:40
politics this is transactional he'll
10:43
give the anti-abortion movement this and
10:44
they'll give him his votes it's not
10:46
about morality it's about politics it's
10:48
not about morality it's about politics
10:50
it's about winning votes it's about
10:52
cting interest groups and building his
10:54
Coalition and so that long history of
10:57
back and forth of transactional politics
10:59
of flip-flopping that all really leads
11:01
us to this
11:03
[Music]
11:04
moment at the end of the video he says
11:07
always go by your heart but we must win
11:10
we have to win we have to win and that's
11:14
basically Trump's views on abortion in a
11:16
nutshell he's kind of saying the quiet
11:18
part out loud right like this isn't
11:20
about abortion it's about winning votes
11:23
and if this issue isn't going to win me
11:24
votes I'm ditching it that's exactly
11:27
right and that of course leads to a more
11:29
essential question which is will his
11:31
political gamble to chart this middle
11:33
path well will it
11:36
[Music]
11:40
work we'll be right
11:45
back so Lisa Trump is making a BET right
Will it work
11:49
that not going all in on the abortion
11:51
issue is a smart move politically help
11:55
me understand how exactly he thinks this
11:58
will help him win well we don't know
12:00
exactly what he's thinking but what he's
12:02
clearly trying to do is create a
12:04
political position that allows moderates
12:06
who may want to support him but also
12:09
support abortion rights to cast their
12:11
votes for him I spend a lot of time
12:14
talking to voters about their views on
12:15
abortion and their views are complicated
12:18
often more complicated than you can get
12:20
at in survey questions this is an issue
12:22
that's really intimate it's really
12:24
personal and so you have a lot of
12:27
Republicans mostly more moderate
12:29
Republicans who support some form of
12:32
abortion rights it's more than 40% by
12:34
some surveys and so what Trump is trying
12:37
to do here is make it okay for people
12:40
with these complicated views about
12:41
abortion to vote for him even if they do
12:44
support abortion rights he's saying look
12:47
I'm not with the party that wants to do
12:49
all this extreme stuff I actually have a
12:51
more moderate view if you are kind of a
12:54
moderate on the abortion issue I'm your
12:56
guy that's exactly right and this is
12:58
important because while these voters who
13:00
are Republican but support some form of
13:02
abortion rights across the country
13:04
they're more concentrated in these
13:06
really crucial swingy Battleground
13:09
Suburban districts places like Suburban
13:11
Phoenix or Suburban Milwaukee and
13:13
support in those kinds of places won
13:16
Biden the election in 2020 that was a
13:18
big reason why he was able to win the
13:20
White House so what Trump is trying to
13:22
do is ensure that he can while maybe not
13:25
totally win those places at least cut
13:28
into Biden's strength in those areas and
13:31
also allow those voters to think about
13:33
issues that he believes are more
13:35
favorable for Republicans immigration or
13:37
inflation or crime let them vote on
13:40
those issues by neutralizing in his mind
13:43
this question about abortion rights
13:45
right got it but where does that leave
13:48
his base though I mean doesn't this
13:50
position alienate them well so what
13:52
Trump is calculating here is that his
13:54
base is with him anyhow conservative
13:56
Christians are behind his bid just as
13:59
they have been since 2016 these are
14:01
people who have stuck with him through
14:02
all of it not just the loss in 2020 but
14:06
January 6 the indictments his current
14:09
legal Peril a lot of these conservative
14:12
Christians are still with him and
14:14
they're going to vote for him regardless
14:16
of what he says about abortion now also
14:18
because they're still giving him credit
14:20
for accomplishing this really big thing
14:22
that was in fact the thing the
14:24
overturning of row and you could really
14:26
see that in the statements that
14:28
anti-abortion leaders and groups put out
14:30
responding to this video people like
14:32
margerie danfelter who leads a really
14:35
big anti-abortion group you know some of
14:37
them took issue with what Trump said
14:39
some of them didn't like that he didn't
14:41
support any kind of federal action
14:43
particularly a federal ban but none of
14:46
them said that they wouldn't be voting
14:48
for him in November and in fact many of
14:50
the leaders in the group said that they
14:51
would continue to work tirelessly to
14:53
defeat Biden okay so this is Trump's
14:56
political Gambit he's hoping that most
14:59
of his base actually stays with him and
15:02
he's trying to win over some of the
15:03
voters in the middle what do his
15:05
colleagues within the Republican Party
15:07
make of all of this well for people like
15:10
Senator Lindsey Graham like former vice
15:12
president Mike Pence people who really
15:15
had opposition to abortion as a defining
15:18
cause a central cause of their political
15:20
career they came out and said they
15:22
didn't like this at all for them the
15:24
fall of constitutional abortion rights
15:26
was only the beginning they want to
15:28
eliminate abortion across the country so
15:30
they need some kind of federal statute
15:33
and so they came out and they offered
15:35
some harsh criticism of trump saying
15:37
that he had abandoned this foundational
15:40
cause of the Republican party and Trump
15:43
he hit right back he went on his social
15:46
media Network true social and he
15:48
attacked Marjorie Dan felzer and Senator
15:51
Graham saying that they should study
15:54
State's rights in the 10th Amendment and
15:56
after they did they should get on with
15:57
helping Republicans elections rather
16:00
than he said making impossible for them
16:03
to do so I mean he's doing a very trumpy
16:06
thing right he has that kind of bull in
16:08
a china shop upending these LGH held
16:11
Republican positions you know for so
16:14
long Republicans opposed abortion no
16:16
matter what like that was the default
16:18
position but Trump is saying hey the
16:21
politics have changed here guys we have
16:23
to change with them and for this handful
16:27
of Republicans who opposed what he said
16:29
there were plenty of Republicans
16:31
particularly candidates in swing states
16:34
that quickly aligned themselves with
16:35
Trump's new position on this Cary Lake
16:38
the Republican Senate nominee in Arizona
16:42
and the Republican in Ohio and the Ohio
16:44
Senate race uh candidates in Michigan
16:48
thought that Trump had offered them a
16:49
new template a way to talk about this
16:52
issue that may defang some of the
16:54
political attacks against them that are
16:56
being launched by democrats interesting
16:58
so this is Maybe showing a way kind of
17:00
out of the woods for swing state
17:02
Republicans on a pretty difficult issue
17:05
for Republicans well certainly giving
17:07
them a glimmer of hope that they can
17:09
find their way out well we don't know of
17:11
course is if it's going to work and
17:12
there's a lot of reasons why it may not
17:14
you know Trump is really trying to have
17:16
it both ways he wants credit for being
17:18
the president who appointed the justices
17:20
who overturned row but he also wants to
17:23
wash his hands of the political
17:25
ramifications of this issue and
17:27
Democrats are just not going to let him
17:29
do that his statement on Monday was met
17:32
with a flood of democratic response
17:35
Biden put out a statement that campaign
17:37
hammered him and perhaps the most
17:39
impactful and and really Salient thing
17:41
the bid campaign did is they released a
17:44
new ad with a woman telling the story of
17:47
how after she lost her pregnancy she was
17:49
unable to get an abortion in Texas and
17:52
developed a severe infection that almost
17:54
killed her twice and now may make it
17:56
impossible for her to ever have another
17:58
child
17:59
and it's a really personal heart
18:02
stirring ad that really gets at why this
18:05
issue is just so difficult for
18:07
Republicans the stories are so intimate
18:10
they're so real and there's just a
18:12
steady drum be of them coming out of
18:14
these conservative States so as much as
18:17
Republicans want to talk about this in
18:19
this sort of distance way of states
18:21
rights versus Federal rights this is a
18:24
situation that is really real for a lot
18:26
of women in America and forcing them to
18:29
make really difficult medical and
18:32
emotional choices so it continues to be
18:35
a very live very difficult issue for
18:38
Trump I mean you know saying it's should
18:40
be back to the States as you point out
18:42
doesn't mean that the issue goes away
18:44
the states are still passing these very
18:47
restrictive banss which are of course
18:48
made possible by the overturning of row
18:52
and these banss are at a national level
18:54
pretty unpopular correct and even if
18:56
republicans in Congress aren't taking
18:58
steps on this Republicans in state
19:00
houses are moving forward we saw this in
19:02
Florida where the court upheld a 15we
19:05
ban that will next month be a six- we
19:07
ban on the procedure that issue will
19:09
then go to voters in November in the
19:11
form of a ballot measure and even as we
19:13
sit here right now recording this
19:15
episode in the studio we are waiting on
19:17
a decision from the Arizona Supreme
19:19
Court which is going to decide whether
19:21
the state's current ban on nearly all
19:23
abortions after 15 weeks stays in place
19:26
or become something even more
19:27
restrictive so this is just a very live
19:30
issue and it's something that continues
19:32
to dominate headlines and continues to
19:35
be top of mind for a lot of American
19:37
voters and particularly American
Conclusion
19:41
women and look I think what Donald Trump
19:44
really wanted to do with this video was
19:46
take abortion off the table sort of
19:48
neutralize it for the election but
19:51
whatever Trump wants this issue is not
19:53
going anywhere it's something that's
19:55
going to continue to dominate through
19:56
this presidential race and potentially
19:59

for rape or incest
