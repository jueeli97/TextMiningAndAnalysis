Why the Race to Replace George Santos Is So Close



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
tavernes and this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:12
daily today voters in New York will
0:15
choose the successor to George Santos
0:18
the disgraced Republican who was
0:20
expelled from Congress in
0:22
December Democrats would seem to have
0:24
the advantage instead it's a dead
0:28
Heat
0:30
my colleague Nick fandos explains why
0:34
and tells me how the results of the race
0:36
will hold important clues for both
0:39
parties come
0:40

[Applause]

[Music]
0:45
November it's Tuesday February
0:49
[Music]
0:54
13th so Nick you've been following the
0:56
race for the seat forly occupied by
1:00
George Santos and you know setting aside
1:03
Santos's brief and kind of riveting
1:05
Congressional tenure I'd like to start
1:08
with the most basic question which is
1:10
why does this race over this one house
1:13
seat on Long Island matter it's a great
1:17
question now I'd start by saying let's
1:18
not just so quickly race over George
1:20
Santos this was a guy whose year-long
1:23
embarrassment put this District on the
1:24
map I think left a lot of Voters there
1:26
really exacerbated I mean it is probably
1:29
the reason why you and I are talking
1:30
right now that's very true but we're
1:32
also talking because this is a really
1:34
special district we're talking about a
1:36
slice of Queens and Long Island that is
1:39
racially diverse ethnically diverse got
1:41
people of all kinds of socioeconomic
1:43
statuses and as such it's the type of
1:46
place that we see all over the country
1:48
where elections are probably going to be
1:50
decided later this year for president
1:52
and for control of the House of
1:54
Representatives this area has swung back
1:57
and forth a lot so President Biden won
1:59
this District by eight points in 2020
2:01
and then 2 years later in 2022 George
2:03
Santos was one of a handful of
2:05
Republicans who flip seats right here in
2:07
New York that helped the Republican
2:10
Party take the majority in the house I
2:12
remember that that was a big election
2:14
that Republicans just had a wipe out in
2:16
New York yeah so when Santos was
2:18
expelled in December this race becomes a
2:21
really big deal for both parties and
2:23
there's a couple reasons for that if the
2:25
Democrats can win and flip this seat
2:28
they could narrow Republicans majority
2:30
right now in the present at a time when
2:32
they're trying to impeach the homeland
2:33
security secretary or fund the
2:35
government and make their life a lot
2:37
more difficult but it also is a race
2:39
that's going to set the tone for the
2:40
rest of 2024 and give the parties kind
2:43
of an early preview of where the
2:45
elections are headed for all of those
2:48
reasons Democrats feel like this is a
2:49
really good pickup opportunity for us
2:52
and also they're coming out of the
2:53
Santos train crash so you know it's
2:55
logical they would think that right
2:57
exactly but instead as we head into
2:59
election day today we're looking at a
3:01
statistical Dead Heat and Nick what's
3:04
your understanding of why the race is so
3:06
close I think that there's really two
3:09
issues that have come to dominate this
3:11
race above anything else one of them is
3:13
a big International issue that has a
3:15
kind of particular local residence and
3:17
that's the war unfolding right now in
3:19
Gaza so this is one of the most Jewish
3:21
districts in the country and a lot of
3:23
Voters are looking very closely at both
3:25
candidates and how they're approaching
3:27
this the other one is an issue that it's
3:29
in headlines and conversations in
3:32
Washington and all over the country
3:33
right now and that is the situation at
3:35
the southern border where we've seen a
3:37
historic influx of migrants trying to
3:39
cross and the Biden Administration is
3:41
struggling to figure out what to do
3:43
about it okay so let's talk about the
3:46
candidates and how they're dealing with
3:48
those issues so introduce me to the
3:51
Republican right so the Republican in
3:53
this race is a woman named Mazy pilip
3:55
the future of our nation is a stake in
3:58
these Trace for the third congressional
4:01
district on February 13 she's a local
4:05
part-time legislator in Nassau County
4:08
with relatively little political
4:10
experience and this is shown on the
4:11
campaign Trail she's really not doing a
4:13
lot of public events she doesn't speak
4:15
in an unscripted way a lot of her
4:17
positions frankly have been hard for us
4:19
to hash out but in this particular
4:21
moment she has a really remarkable
4:24
personal story that I think she's been
4:26
able to kind of deafly use in the
4:27
campaign I grew up in Israel Israel for
4:31
me a special place when I so she was
4:33
actually born in Ethiopia and as a young
4:36
child was airlifted to Israel where she
4:40
grew up I got my education I served in
4:43
the Israeli Army very proud and served
4:46
as a member of the Israeli Defense
4:47
Forces wow so she served in the military
4:49
she did yeah and has family members who
4:52
still live over there my family my
4:54
entire family live in Israel my nephews
4:57
as we speak fighting the terrorist she
5:02
married a Ukrainian American doctor huh
5:05
moved to uh New York and and settled on
5:07
Long Island yeah and she said very
5:09
explicitly that October 7th changed her
5:12
in a very significant way for me this is
5:16
so personal so painful I can't it
5:19
propelled her to want to run in this
5:21
race this is Attack on the word so we
5:24
have to remember we have to be strong
5:26
and I'm Israel high thank you to front
5:29
both what she sees as anti-israel
5:31
sentiment and anti-Semitism creeping up
5:34
all around the world and in American
5:36
politics particularly she says on the
5:38
left of the democratic party and how
5:40
does she present what she would do on
5:42
Israel I mean who is she in terms of the
5:44
policy stuff with Israel yeah so she is
5:46
a very staunch defender of Israel you
5:49
wouldn't be surprised she doesn't want
5:50
to put any condition on American Aid to
5:53
Israel she thinks a ceasefire is a
5:54
deeply unjust solution she in fact has
5:57
gone so far since October 7th that she
5:59
now now says a two-state solution a
6:01
Palestinian and Israeli state is no
6:03
longer even possible oh wow um it should
6:05
just all be Israel so that's very
6:07
different than you know President
6:09
Biden's position for example that's
6:10
right and it's one of the few things
6:12
that separates her from her Democratic
6:14
opponent on this issue so tell me about
6:16
her Democratic opponent who is he all
6:18
right everybody well my name is Tom
6:19
swazi and I'm running for the United
6:20
States
6:22
Congress so the Democrat in this race is
6:24
Tom swazi he's a really well-known
6:27
Democrat locally he's been around for 30
6:29
years he was the Nassau County Executive
6:31
and he was in fact a three-term member
6:33
of Congress representing this very seat
6:35
in my case you've got somebody that you
6:37
know somebody who's been around somebody
6:39
who's got a proven record of getting
6:40
things done before he decided to run for
6:43
governor didn't go so well and Santos
6:45
got elected and on this issue he's
6:47
presented himself as as staunchly
6:49
pro-israel as pilip is he doesn't want
6:51
to condition Aid he's against a
6:53
ceasefire okay I got to Israel about 7
6:55
hours ago to show solidarity with our
6:57
friends here in Israel and with our
6:58
Jewish friends throughout the the world
7:00
and even in this incredibly short
7:02
campaign he took time out to fly over to
7:04
Israel to prove his bonafides it reminds
7:07
us that evil exists in the
7:09
world and we have to stand strong and
7:13
defeat this terrorist
7:15
operation okay so clear why they're both
7:18
doing that because it's a very Jewish
7:20
District but why is this an issue in
7:23
this District at all then they're both
7:24
pretty similar I think there's two parts
7:27
to understanding this one is the unique
7:30
appeal of Philip's story so remember how
7:33
I said she was in the IDF she's also an
7:35
orthodox Jew she has seven kids who she
7:38
says she worries about facing
7:39
anti-Semitism in the United States she
7:41
has family in Israel our brothers and
7:44
sisters got attacked by a terrorist
7:47
organization she has made concerns about
7:50
this issue visceral in her campaign a
7:52
centerpiece of her campaign in a way
7:54
that frankly I haven't really seen
7:56
another candidate do out on the trail I
7:59
promise you the Jewish people the state
8:02
of Israel the American people will make
8:06
you pay the price you
8:10
deserve and so she's basically giving
8:12
Jewish voters who are uncomfortable or
8:15
nervous in this moment feel like
8:18
historically unsettled an opportunity to
8:21
vote for someone like them and somebody
8:22
who is really going to go to Congress
8:24
and be a voice like nobody doubts that
8:26
this is going to be a centerpiece of her
8:28
identity
8:29
and Congress and at the same time swazi
8:32
is dealing with this other problem which
8:34
is not so much about him but about his
8:36
party okay there's a concern right now I
8:39
think among a lot of American Jews and a
8:41
lot of Voters that I've talked to in
8:42
this race and rabbis that the Democratic
8:45
party's Left Flank has become
8:48
increasingly skeptical or even hostile
8:51
to Israel and so they may be fine with
8:53
Tom swasi but they're just really
8:55
worried about voting for Democrats at
8:57
all right now they either want to make a
8:59
protest or punish the party because they
9:02
don't like the direction that it's going
9:04
and what's his message to them yeah so
9:06
swas is directly addressing this and
9:08
saying actually I agree with you but
9:10
that's the reason you've got to elect me
9:13
another Republican that supports Israel
9:15
is not adding much to the equation you
9:17
don't need another super strong
9:18
pro-israel Republican we've got plenty
9:20
of those you need somebody that is going
9:22
to stand up and get in the trenches and
9:23
fight with his own party that's how we
9:25
put up a Bull workk against this is
9:27
within the Democratic party what we need
9:29
are strong outspoken pro-israel
9:31
Democrats that will stand up for Israel
9:34
and will stand up to the extreme left
9:35
and I'm the guy to do that I am uniquely
9:38
set up to fight exactly the force that
9:40
you were most afraid of which is
9:41
progressives on the left side of the
9:43
democratic party exactly and in my
9:45
reporting I've seen all kinds of signs
9:47
that voters are really kind of torn over
9:49
this so in one part of the district and
9:51
this is where pilip is actually from you
9:52
have a really large population of
9:54
Orthodox Jews and Iranian Jews who have
9:56
become very politically conservative in
9:58
recent years years and her campaign is
10:01
banking on the fact that they are going
10:02
to be super motivated and come out with
10:05
huge numbers and that matters in a low
10:06
turnout election there's also a group of
10:09
Voters that are just DieHard Democrats
10:11
they're Jews they might be concerned
10:13
about Israel but you know they can't
10:14
support her because of her ties to the
10:16
Republican party and Trump or whatever
10:18
the reason but there seems to be a kind
10:21
of contingent in the middle of moderate
10:24
to Liberal American Jews who maybe would
10:26
have sided with Democrats who have been
10:27
an important part of their Coalition for
10:29
a long time that are now looking a lot
10:32
more closely at this Choice I've talked
10:34
to rabbis who are describing
10:35
congregations that are pretty split down
10:37
the middle Jewish voters who say they
10:39
don't know which way to go they like
10:40
swazi personally but you know they've
10:42
never seen a candidate quite so
10:44
outwardly Jewish as pilip is and so
10:47
frankly I don't think we're going to
10:48
know the answer until later today as to
10:50
how all this broke down but in a race
10:52
that's really really close this group
10:54
actually has the potential to swing it
10:56
one way or the other it's pretty
10:57
interesting I mean the people in the
10:58
middle had it not been for October 7th
11:01
perhaps they would have just voted for
11:02
the Democrat because that's kind of
11:04
maybe how they tended to vote but now
11:07
October 7th has kind of made this
11:09
chemical reaction and it's a little bit
11:10
of a wild card we don't know what's
11:12
going to happen right and this is one of
11:14
these issues that I think is being
11:15
watched by political strategists all
11:17
over the country who are wondering okay
11:19
what could this mean potentially in
11:21
other districts have the foundations of
11:23
American politics been shaken so hard
11:26
that Republicans can drive a wedge
11:29
between Jewish voters and Democrats and
11:31
that could potentially have a real
11:33
impact across the
11:39
country and as if that wasn't enough
11:42
remember this district is going to offer
11:43
us a second test case on something that
11:46
is arguably even a bigger issue right
11:48
now and that's
11:51
[Music]
11:57
immigration
12:00
we'll be right
12:01
[Music]
12:10
back so Nick tell me about how
12:12
immigration is shaping this race so let
12:16
me start by just zooming out for a
12:17
second since the pandemic there has been
12:20
a incredible buildup of people from
12:23
Venezuela Latin America other countries
12:25
trying to cross the southern border and
12:27
it's become a big issue Washington right
12:29
now last week we saw President Biden and
12:31
Congress really tangling over a
12:33
potential border deal and it's become
12:34
one of the biggest issues for the 2024
12:37
campaign as well former president Trump
12:39
has made clear that this is the issue
12:41
that he wants to run on one of the ones
12:43
that he really thinks he can beat
12:45
President Biden up on and so on a
12:47
national level this issue is kind of
12:49
everywhere at the moment but there's an
12:51
unusual resonance I think here in New
12:53
York and in this District in particular
12:55
as well now I've been on the show before
12:57
talking about the migrant crisis here in
13:00
New York and all those people streaming
13:02
over the southern border 170,000 of them
13:05
and Counting have come here to New York
13:07
City and it's been a huge quandry for
13:10
the city and for the state and the
13:12
Democrats who run New York it's been
13:14
expensive the mayor has talked about
13:16
having to slash the budget and all of
13:18
that is kind of playing out in this
13:21
District there's actually a migrant
13:22
shelter that the city has erected that
13:24
sits squarely in the congressional
13:26
district and a lot of Voters in it are
13:29
commuting into the city all the time and
13:30
maybe are seeing people lined up outside
13:32
of hotels and if nothing else they're
13:34
reading all kinds of daily headlines uh
13:37
just last week the police commissioner
13:38
of New York was talking about a migrant
13:40
crime wave in New York City all of which
13:43
is kind of suggesting right chaos and
13:46
Chaos under Democrats watch both in
13:48
Washington and in New York okay so where
13:51
do we see this play out on the campaign
13:54
so this issue starts to show up in polls
13:56
very early in this race as a top
13:58
priority of Voters but I think the
14:00
moment that it really crystallized on
14:01
the campaign trail that this thing that
14:04
immigration is going to be the center of
14:05
this campaign was a couple of weeks ago
14:08
when Mazy pilip the Republican candidate
14:10
decided to have her first major press
14:12
conference of the campaign outside that
14:14
migrant shelter in Queens my name is
14:17
Mazi pup I'm illegal immigrant and a
14:20
candidate for congress she shows up she
14:22
introduces herself as a legal immigrant
14:25
before she even said she's the
14:26
Republican candidate for congress the
14:29
District residents worry about our Brer
14:32
crisis and talked about basically how
14:34
bad things have gotten on Democrats
14:36
watch she says he created this problem
14:38
he's been for Sanctuary cities in the
14:40
past like the crisis that we have here
14:42
right now it's their fault and I'm the
14:45
one that'll make it better so she's
14:46
saying I came here the right way legally
14:49
these people didn't and all of this is
14:51
happening under Democrats exactly so
14:53
this looks like a typical kind of
14:54
Republican issue right it's the things
14:56
that Republicans are doing all over the
14:57
country right now but the really kind of
15:00
wild thing that happens is swasi finds
15:02
out that this is going to happen and he
15:04
gets in his car and drives to the
15:06
migrant shelter himself oh wow and sets
15:08
up a press conference right next to her
15:10
so that when she wraps up he steps up to
15:12
the microphones and says as we saw in
15:15
the press conference that my opponent
15:16
was get a few minutes ago she didn't
15:17
give any solutions she recounted why
15:20
it's a problem we all know it's a
15:21
problem some of us have been talking
15:23
about it for decades hi I'm the Democrat
15:26
in this race and I agree this is a total
15:28
problem for this district Key to solving
15:30
problems complicated problems is
15:32
compromise you got to get both sides to
15:34
cut a deal that's the only way you can
15:36
solve these problems but here's how I
15:39
would deal with it I want to find a
15:40
bipartisan solution and my opponent
15:42
isn't going to do that so he basically
15:45
wants to show everybody he's no less
15:47
tough on the issue than she is he's like
15:48
okay I see your press conference I'll
15:50
raise you mine but like what's he really
15:53
doing here yeah it's a striking moment
15:55
because I think that we are used to in
15:57
the kind of political world thinking of
15:58
immigration as an issue that Republicans
16:00
attack on and Democrats either stay
16:02
quiet or try to ignore it and here you
16:04
have the Democratic candidate really
16:07
diving head first into an issue that
16:10
poll show voters are blaming his party
16:12
for in some ways this is really kind of
16:14
typical for somebody like Tom swazi
16:16
who's a Centrist who likes to Buck his
16:18
party but I think it also reflects that
16:20
he learned an important lesson from
16:22
20122 when Republicans perform much
16:25
better here in New York than they did in
16:26
the rest of the country and they did in
16:28
part by really speaking to and kind of
16:31
channeling fears about Rising crime in
16:34
New York and Democrats by their own
16:36
admission didn't take it seriously
16:37
enough and they seated it to Republicans
16:40
swasi saw that and his takeaway was this
16:43
can't be a republican issue or
16:44
Democratic issue this is an issue that
16:46
voters care about and that they're
16:47
talking about and if I don't dive into
16:49
it and show them that I'm taking it
16:51
seriously and trying to solve it well
16:53
then yeah I am going to be politically
16:55
washed out with President Biden and
16:56
other Democrats who are getting the
16:58
blame
16:59
so he's really trying to both kind of
17:01
separate himself from his party here in
17:03
an important way and dive into an issue
17:06
that we've seen Democrats pretty
17:07
uncomfortable grappling with which in a
17:10
way is a pretty bad sign for National
17:12
level Democrats right including Biden
17:15
heading into November like that a
17:16
democrat in a swing District of a blue
17:19
state is running away from his own
17:21
party's position on immigration but
17:24
that's also a pretty tricky needle for
17:26
him to thread yeah no doubt especially
17:29
in a special election where by the way
17:31
candidates usually win and lose based on
17:33
their ability to turn out their most
17:34
loyal voters normally you're not
17:36
Reaching Across the aleis but I think
17:38
that swasi is finding himself having to
17:39
do this is emblematic of just how bad
17:42
this issue is for Democrats and how bad
17:45
their brand has become in a place like
17:47
the suburbs of New York City remember
17:49
Biden won this District pretty easily
17:51
four years ago but now in the latest
17:54
polling in this race and I'm talking to
17:56
voters out in the field it's quite clear
17:58
that Biden's numbers have dropped
18:00
precipitously in fact he's trailing
18:02
Donald Trump and head-to-heads here in
18:04
the suburbs and a large part of that has
18:07
to do with immigration voters seem to be
18:09
very exercised by the sense of this
18:11
issue being out of control and Democrats
18:13
the ones that they put in power not
18:15
doing enough about it and so if pilp is
18:18
trying to make this race into basically
18:20
a referendum on President Biden and the
18:23
Democratic party viav immigration what
18:26
swasi is trying to do is make it a
18:28
battle between Tom swazi the Democrat
18:31
and Mazy pip the Republican over who's
18:33
got the better idea to help solve this
18:35
problem he's saying yeah I agree with
18:37
you that we have a problem but let's
18:39
argue about the way to fix it and get
18:40
voters to really focus in on that and in
18:43
that area he may have gotten some help
18:45
last week you're referring to the deal
18:48
that the Republicans actually wanted and
18:50
then bailed on at the last minute this
18:51
deal in the Senate immigration that's
18:53
right so swasi is able to go out and say
18:56
look here's a bipartisan solution that
18:58
the Democrats agreed to give Republicans
19:00
almost everything that they wanted
19:01
there's some money for the wall there's
19:03
money to speed up and change the Asylum
19:05
process we can increase deportations
19:08
this is the kind of thing that's going
19:09
to help us solve the problem in the
19:11
country this is the kind of thing that
19:11
I'd support So when his Republican
19:13
opponent comes out and trashes it and
19:15
says this is a legalization of the
19:18
invasion that we're seeing in the Border
19:20
swazi moves really quickly to say okay
19:23
remember my Republican was telling you
19:24
this was a really big problem now she
19:26
seems to be putting politics
19:29
over solving that policy problem because
19:31
president Trump and her party would
19:33
rather not give President Biden the
19:35
victory basically saying look this is a
19:38
pretty cynical political move they're
19:39
using it for their own political gain
19:41
instead of actually trying to fix the
19:43
problem exactly and how does pilip
19:45
respond to that pilip responds by
19:48
basically doubling down and saying why
19:50
should we trust you on the solution when
19:53
you arguably helped create this problem
19:55
in the first place and this is where
19:57
swasi runs into some trouble with that
19:59
long record of his it turns out when
20:01
you've been in politics for 30 years you
20:04
accumulate a record that's pretty easy
20:05
to go in and pluck things out of to
20:07
support an argument like this so
20:08
National Republicans and the pup
20:11
campaign have been airing millions of
20:14
dollars of ads that showed he voted with
20:16
Biden 100% of the time when he was still
20:19
in Congress so it really connects him to
20:21
the president on all kinds of issues and
20:24
then there's this one ad in particular
20:25
that has been running over and over and
20:27
over again illegal immigrants arriving
20:29
by the bus load why because Tom swazi
20:33
repeatedly weakened America's borders
20:35
that includes a clip of swazi during his
20:37
ill-fated run for governor a couple of
20:39
years ago when I was county executive of
20:41
nasau County I kicked ice out of Nassau
20:43
County bragging on a debate stage about
20:45
how he kicked ice that is Immigration
20:48
and Customs Enforcement out of Nassau
20:51
County when he was County Executive
20:52
essentially a pro-immigration stance
20:55
right that's how it looks in Congress
20:57
he'll make it worse Congressional
20:59
leadership fund is responsible for the
21:01
content of this
21:02
advertising now swasi has explained he
21:04
had good reason the ice officers pulled
21:06
guns on nasau County police officers but
21:09
when you really get under the data uh
21:11
and talk to strategists that are working
21:13
on this race that ad has taken a real
21:15
bite out of sw's image and seems to be
21:18
helping pup undermine voters trust in
21:21
his ability to solve the problem so
21:23
we've also seen in polls that voters who
21:26
care the most about the Border and
21:28
that's a plurality of Voters as we said
21:30
trust pup more than they trust swasi
21:33
okay so given all of this you know of
21:36
course we're not going to know the
21:37
answer until tonight when we get the
21:38
election results but Nick just casting a
21:41
little bit ahead here say the Republican
21:44
wins say Philip wins what should
21:47
Republicans take away from that what's
21:49
the lesson there Republicans took a big
21:52
hit last week for pulling out of that
21:54
bipartisan immigration deal that they
21:57
themselves demand it and help negotiate
22:00
but they did it for a reason arguably
22:02
they did it because it is a very good
22:04
political issue for them and they want
22:06
to run their 2024 campaigns on it and if
22:09
they are end up being successful in this
22:11
race which is really kind of the very
22:13
first test of that strategy I think it
22:15
may tell them that that was worth it at
22:17
least politically and that this is the
22:20
path that they ought to continue going
22:21
down both as they run against President
22:23
Biden but also in Senate and House races
22:26
all over the country where things are
22:28
close and voters may be similarly
22:30
disposed to blame the Democrats for it
22:33
and on the other hand if Mazy pilip
22:36
loses and swasi wins well I don't think
22:39
that we'll see Republicans completely
22:41
abandon immigration as an issue by any
22:44
means I think they're going to have to
22:45
take a hard look at the kind of Suite of
22:48
issues that they're running on and
22:49
whether that alone is enough to get
22:51
candidates across the Finish Line in
22:53
these tough districts and Nick what
22:55
about the Democrat I mean what if swasi
22:58
wins what would that tell Democrats so
23:00
swazi if he can win would essentially be
23:03
writing a playbook for Democrats across
23:05
the country and I think it would go
23:07
something like this keep pounding your
23:10
Republican opponent on abortion and
23:12
Trump and issues like that right but you
23:15
can't ignore the issues that Republicans
23:17
really like either you got to dive in in
23:19
the mud and start wrestling with them
23:22
and if you can separate yourself from
23:23
President Biden a little bit along the
23:25
way or you can otherwise show you're
23:28
willing to push against party Orthodoxy
23:31
then voters might just reward you for
23:33
that they might look at you and say okay
23:35
this is the kind of politician who might
23:37
be able to help solve problems for us
23:39
let's give him a
23:41
shot and on the other hand if having
23:43
done all of that a candidate like Tom
23:46
swazi who entered this race well-known
23:48
and well-liked he had a democratic
23:50
registration advantage and a lot more
23:52
money than his Republican opponent can't
23:54
pull this out I think that's going to be
23:57
a very potent warning sign for President
23:59
Biden and his party that this fall is
24:02
going to be one heck of a
24:03

Sabrina in a troubling sign for turnout
24:19
in Tuesday's special election heavy snow
24:22
was forecast in the New York metro area
24:23
over the day on Tuesday with some areas
24:26
expected to receive up to 2 in an hour a
24:29
significant storm could create even
24:32
greater uncertainty in a contest whose
24:34
outcome is likely to be decided by a
24:36
small
24:43
margin we'll be right
24:53
back here's what else you should know
24:56
today on Monday Israel's military said
24:59
it had conducted a wave of attacks on
25:02
the southern gazen city of Rafa to
25:04
provide cover for soldiers undertaking a
25:07
hostage Rescue Mission there Israeli
25:10
Special Forces raided a building There
25:12
Before Dawn freeing two hostages held by
25:15
Hamas the gazan health Ministry said at
25:18
least 67 Palestinians had been killed
25:21
the Ministries figures do not
25:23
distinguish between combatants and
25:25
civilians the operation was with El in
25:28
Israel and was a major boost for prime
25:31
minister Benjamin Netanyahu but for
25:34
Palestinians it carried a sense of
25:36
forboding that a broader Israeli
25:38
operation to capture the city was
25:40
beginning Netanyahu has ordered the
25:43
military to draw plans to evacuate
25:45
civilians from Rafa but Aid groups say
25:48
there is no place left for them to
25:51
go and a judge in Atlanta said that he
25:55
would move ahead with a hearing later
25:57
this week delving into a romantic
26:00
relationship between the two prosecutors
26:02
who were leading an election
26:03
interference case against Donald Trump
26:06
and his allies the revelations about the
26:09
relationship have created turmoil around
26:11
the case one of several against Trump
26:13
involving the 2020 election and his
26:16
alleged efforts to subvert it the
26:19
defense is trying to get the two
26:20
prosecutors fonnie Willis The Fulton
26:23
County district attorney and Nathan Wade
26:26
whom she hired to run the case
26:28
disqualified arguing that the
26:30
relationship gives the appearance of
26:32
impropriety and would lead to an unfair
26:38
