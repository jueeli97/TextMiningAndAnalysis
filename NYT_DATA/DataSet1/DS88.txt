Oregon Decriminalized Drugs. Voters Now Regret It.



0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael boaro
0:04
this is the
0:04
[Music]
0:10
Daily 3 years ago Oregon became the
0:14
first state in the country to
0:16
decriminalize the possession of hard
0:18
drugs now they're about to reverse
0:22
course today my colleague Mike Baker on
0:26
what went
0:28
wrong
0:36
it's Tuesday March
0:39
[Music]
0:42
12th Mike I want to begin with how and
0:45
why the state of Oregon ever decided to
0:48
decriminalize hard drugs the decision
0:51
that really sets this entire story into
0:54
motion yeah I mean if we go back 5 years
0:57
ago just before the pandemic we can all
0:59
remember the opioid crisis that was
1:02
spreading across the country and Oregon
1:05
on its own was really struggling drug
1:08
overdoses had been rising at quite an
1:12
alarming rate and the state ranked among
1:15
the worst in access to drug treatment at
1:17
the time and as we know arrest and jail
1:20
have been a central strategy to
1:22
combating drugs for decades and for
1:25
people in Oregon they're looking around
1:26
saying this has not been working that
1:28
model is broken
1:30
it's time for a new path and one of the
1:33
options that began to emerge was is it
1:36
time to decriminalize these drugs and
1:38
focus on treatment and there was already
1:40
a road map that suggested
1:42
decriminalization could work just
1:44
explain that well if you remember
1:46
Washington State in Colorado in 2012
1:49
legalized the recreational use of
1:51
marijuana Oregon legalized it shortly
1:54
after in 2014 mhm and the states that
1:56
followed that path you know I they found
1:58
a lot of success they could get more tax
2:00
revenue they could reprioritize their
2:03
law enforcement resources they could
2:05
deal with racial disparities that had
2:07
been in the system for decades there
2:10
were a range of benefits all without the
2:12
sort of Doomsday scenarios that a lot of
2:14
people had predicted would happen right
2:16
the sky did not at all fall as some had
2:18
feared when pot was decriminalized in
2:21
any of these states right and now it's
2:23
spread across the country about half of
2:25
states have legalized marijuana and now
2:28
obviously pot is not an opioid opioids
2:30
are much harder drugs but at a
2:34
fundamental level the motivation here is
2:36
still the same that jail is not the
2:38
answer and so people started to really
2:41
coales around this idea it's a
2:43
progressive State and Advocates saw a
2:45
pathway to develop a plan and put it on
2:48
the ballot for voters to consider MH so
2:50
that's how in 2020 we found ourselves
2:53
with this ballot initiative measure 110
2:56
okay so tell us about measure 110 what's
2:59
in it exactly the thrust of the measure
3:02
is really to focus on stop treating drug
3:05
addiction as a crime and start treating
3:07
it as a health issue and there are two
3:11
parts of the plan one side you would
3:12
decriminalize possession of small
3:15
amounts of drugs you know not a amount
3:18
that a maybe a dealer might carry and
3:21
that would be decriminalizing things
3:22
like heroin and cocaine and
3:25
Fentanyl and on the other hand of the
3:27
initiative you'd have these long overdue
3:31
Investments hundreds of millions of
3:33
dollars in building out drug treatment
3:35
services that the state had really been
3:38
lacking H so as proposed what happens
3:43
when authorities in Oregon come across
3:46
an addict who possesses a small amount
3:49
of cocaine or fentanyl for example what
3:52
what's the envisioned process if an
3:55
officer comes across someone on the
3:56
sidewalk using a drug the goal was for
3:59
that officer to not arrest but to issue
4:03
a citation with a $100 fine instead of
4:05
sending that person to jail they could
4:09
avoid that fine by calling a phone
4:11
number getting a health assessment and
4:13
potentially being directed into a
4:15
treatment program that would serve them
4:17
so the thinking is nobody is going to
4:18
want to pay that $100 fine so somebody
4:22
will instead call that number and enter
4:25
this pipeline for treatment right a
4:28
small penalty a big funnel to get people
4:30
into treatment and at the same time
4:33
there's a ton of funding available to
4:35
make this happen because the plan takes
4:37
cannabis tax revenue that the state has
4:38
been collecting and directs it into
4:41
building out this treatment H so in a
4:44
sense one form of decriminalization of
4:45
pot finances the cost of
4:48
decriminalizing the other which is hard
4:51
drugs you got it and there's a lot of
4:54
money behind the effort and there's also
4:56
a lot of powerful
4:58
people the drug policy Alliance which
5:01
was a Reform Group backed by billionaire
5:04
George Soros contributed millions of
5:07
dollars to lead the effort the
5:09
initiative also won funding from
5:11
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his
5:13
wife Priscilla Chan and it was winning
5:16
big endorsements left and right everyone
5:19
from the ACLU to the state democratic
5:22
party to the Oregon Nurses
5:25
Association and in Portland you the
5:27
local district attorney Mike Schmidt the
5:30
prosecutor who would handle drug crimes
5:31
in the city he comes out and says you
5:34
know I think what we've been doing
5:35
clearly has failed he's also in favor of
5:38
measure 110 Wow Let's try something
5:40
different there was really sort of a
5:43
ground swell of support that was
5:44
building as the year went on and in
5:48
November 2020 and a first in the nation
5:51
in Oregon Oregon voters passed a
5:54
groundbreaking Drug law reform ballot
5:56
measure 110 passes with 50 % of the vote
6:00
I think this is a good thing because way
6:02
too many people get locked up in America
6:05
for way too long I mean I I view Oregon
6:08
as a very important and I'll say
6:10
necessary lab experiment so let's all
6:17
watch I mean it's worth saying this
6:20
moment is kind of a revolution in
6:23
America's relationship to hard drugs
6:27
absolutely one Advocate said that night
6:30
that the results were like taking a
6:32
sledgehammer to the Cornerstone of the
6:34
drug war they really envisioned that
6:37
point that this was going to be the
6:38
start of a wave of legislation across
6:40
the country the first of many states to
6:43
do this right they envisioned movement
6:46
in Washington state and Vermont and
6:49
Maine and DC and then building up
6:52
momentum towards an eventual ballot
6:55
initiative in California H this was the
6:58
start of of a new wave of
7:01
decriminalization okay so what happens
7:04
after measure 110 is adopted by the
7:07
voters in Oregon and this new system is
7:10
in place so it rolls out in early 2021
7:14
it's finally happening police instead of
7:17
arresting people they start handing out
7:19
these $100 citations mhm but the roll
7:22
out's a bit Rocky from the
7:24
start pretty soon it becomes clear that
7:27
very few people are calling this state
7:30
hotline to be guided into treatment and
7:34
over the following months and then years
7:36
what people see on the streets of
7:39
Portland in particular but also in other
7:41
parts of Oregon is a sense of
7:43
lawlessness this corner of Southwest
7:45
forth in Washington is in many ways a
7:48
hub of downtown in one where the crisis
7:50
on our streets is on Full display
7:53
there's open drug use people shooting up
7:56
or cooking drugs on the streets since
7:58
the overdose how many times have you
8:00
smoked thus far about 15 to 25 times
8:03
today and it's probably not even noon
8:05
yet you know in portions of downtown
8:08
Portland it wasn't uncommon to see
8:10
people really in the throws of Crisis
8:13
screaming in the middle of the street
8:15
back when I was homeless it was brutal
8:17
but nothing like it is today businesses
8:20
were suffering many of them started
8:22
hiring private security you can't get a
8:24
police response if you try you wait on
8:26
hold for hours only to be told just F
8:29
something out online and hope and that
8:31
hope is dead so people in Portland were
8:33
complaining like this is getting worse
8:35
overdoses in downtown Portland led to
8:38
another loss of life on the sidewalk
8:41
people started to see overdoses around
8:43
them on the streets more people downtown
8:45
Portland are carrying Narcan on
8:48
themselves just in case they encounter
8:50
someone who's overdosed on the sidewalk
8:52
it's just been just
8:57
Relentless and through all that the
8:59
overdose numbers are surging upward
9:02
opioid overdose deaths Rose 50%
9:06
2021 then another 30%
9:09
2022 it's gotten so bad that in the
9:12
county where Portland is there were more
9:14
deaths during the pandemic from
9:16
overdoses than from covid W and even for
9:20
people who had supported this
9:22
decriminalization movement they're
9:25
starting to rethink their
9:28
position before long there's a rising
9:32
call in Oregon to get rid of measure 110
9:42
altoe we'll be right
9:47
back so Mike as people start calling for
9:50
measure 110 to be ruled back I'm
9:53
wondering were they right to point the
9:56
finger at this law was measure 110
10:00
really to blame for what was happening
10:02
in Oregon you know it's really hard to
10:05
say the passage of
10:07
110 is happening at the same time that
10:11
these other forces are sort of colliding
10:13
in Oregon you know we have the pandemic
10:16
which is contributing to societal
10:17
struggles exacerbating problems on the
10:21
streets we have fentanyl which has been
10:24
spreading around the country it's
10:26
particularly addictive it's super cheap
10:29
it's deadly and around the time that
10:32
measure 110 passed it was really
10:34
starting to Surge in Oregon and we have
10:36
this other reality that measure 110 was
10:40
really supposed to be two parts and
10:42
while the decriminalization component
10:44
had been put into place the other half
10:47
of the bill the investments in drug
10:48
treatment were still struggling to get
10:51
off the ground just explain that I mean
10:53
how much was it struggling to get off
10:55
the ground you know the state agency
10:58
that was in charge of organizing the
11:01
effort of directing the tax revenue it's
11:04
also the same agency that was at the
11:06
same time in charge of the state's covid
11:09
response and distributing vaccines at
11:12
the time there were delays in organizing
11:15
how that Revenue was going to be
11:17
distributed and then later on even when
11:19
that money did go out the door the drug
11:21
treatment organizations that received it
11:24
they found themselves struggling to find
11:25
workers to actually do the job H right
11:28
another way perhaps that the pandemic
11:30
collides with all this right and so you
11:32
have these you know the
11:33
decriminalization component may have
11:35
happened just a few months after the
11:38
bill was passed but years after the bill
11:40
was passed there's still a fledgling
11:43
effort to get these treatment programs
11:45
the funding and the resources and the
11:47
growth they need to actually have a
11:49
powerful impact H so there are a number
11:52
of reasons you're saying why the problem
11:55
of drug use and Drug overdoses get worse
11:58
in the after math of measure 110 and one
12:02
of them seems to be that the measure
12:04
itself isn't really fully implemented
12:07
and that this essential half of it
12:09
treatment doesn't really ever get up and
12:11
running the way it was supposed to so
12:14
what people end up seeing on the streets
12:16
there in a place like Portland is kind
12:18
of one side of it the permissive side of
12:20
the law in the form of these desperate
12:23
drug infused Street Scenes but not much
12:26
of the treatment side that was designed
12:28
to to treat it and prevent it yeah and
12:32
the researchers are looking at this and
12:34
saying they can't find a link between
12:38
the passage of mesure 110 and these
12:40
Rising overdose
12:42
numbers but to a lot of Voters it
12:45
doesn't really matter and one thing
12:47
that's really striking is how many
12:49
progressives in the state really start
12:52
taking the position that it's time to
12:54
make major changes to this measure like
12:56
who well we have a new governor
12:58
Progressive Tina cotek voters did not
13:01
vote to say it's okay to use drugs out
13:03
in public she had been supportive of the
13:06
decriminalization component of measure
13:08
110 but she starts promoting the idea of
13:12
really being tougher on drugs that the
13:14
sort of public drug use that people are
13:16
seeing on the streets is not acceptable
13:18
behavior we don't allow for alcohol we
13:20
don't allow for marijuana why would we
13:22
allow it for other types of drugs so
13:24
unintended consequence of 110 needs to
13:26
get fixed you know another notable
13:28
figure you're shifting on this issue is
13:30
that local district attorney Mike
13:32
Schmidt in Portland I do think that we
13:34
need to take a hard look at open use on
13:36
our streets I think it's time to
13:38
recognize that that doesn't make people
13:40
feel safe now starts coming out to tell
13:43
lawmakers that we really do need to have
13:45
some sort of criminal penalty here to
13:47
ban this public drug use we're seeing in
13:49
the city so I think looking at open use
13:52
on our street is another area where we
13:53
should maybe look at changing the law a
13:55
little bit and as that shift is
13:58
happening we have new polling that
14:00
reflects frustration it's clear to
14:03
everyone that voter opinion has shifted
14:05
on this 56% of oregonians say enough is
14:09
enough get rid of it already and
14:12
Democratic lawmakers leadership you know
14:14
they're starting to see the writing on
14:15
the wall so by last fall just a few
14:18
months ago there's a bipartisan group of
14:20
lawmakers saying that they're ready to
14:23
pass legislation that would effectively
14:25
roll back measure
14:27
110
14:31
and specifically what would this
14:34
legislation do and and how would it do
14:36
it the bill proposed to rec criminalize
14:40
possession of hard drugs that could
14:42
result in jail sentences of up to 180
14:46
days but the measure is also designed to
14:49
offer a whole range of opportunities for
14:51
someone caught with drugs to avoid
14:53
criminal penalties to avoid a criminal
14:56
record the idea was that local law
14:59
enforcement could potentially choose to
15:01
take someone directly to treatment
15:04
instead of to jail for those who do end
15:07
up within the court system the hope is
15:09
to create a whole range of off-ramps
15:13
from Criminal prosecution someone could
15:16
request probation complete treatment and
15:18
then have the charges dismissed even
15:21
those who sort of go through the
15:22
treatment and stumble or they don't show
15:24
up or they fail they are offered
15:26
additional chances along the way to get
15:28
treatment
15:29
instead of jail time so it's not a total
15:33
roll back and re criminalization but
15:35
it's a roll back and it is a form of Rec
15:38
criminalization that's right and this
15:41
sets off really some of the most
15:43
emotional and personal debate you will
15:46
ever see in a state
15:48
legislature thank you everybody for
15:50
being here today this meeting is going
15:52
to go till 9:00 tonight or until we run
15:54
out of public testimony whichever comes
15:56
first you have supporters of the role
15:58
back saying that decriminalization was a
16:01
failure I've watched firsthand the
16:03
crisis unfold outside my doors not only
16:06
are most vulnerable populations dying in
16:08
numbers we've never seen but you've
16:10
asked the community at large to
16:11
normalize walking by dead bodies on the
16:13
sidewalk normalized being chased by
16:16
people high on meth wielding machetes
16:18
they're describing horrific scenes
16:20
they've witnessed on the street as a
16:22
concerned father I drive down Lancaster
16:25
every morning to take my kid to school
16:26
and I see people in bus stops smoking f
16:28
and I see kids waiting to the side
16:31
because they can't use the bus stops
16:32
because they're telling stories of
16:35
family members struggling with addiction
16:37
one of my sons uh Taylor marck he died
16:40
at the age of 24 due to a fentanyl
16:43
overdose they describe people who could
16:45
not help themselves when Taylor was
16:47
using he was in what we would call his
16:50
drug brain he wouldn't have made a
16:52
decision to look at a card and call a
16:54
treatment center they are really argue
16:56
that there needs to be some sort of
16:58
consequence in order to compel people
17:00
towards treatment I am about to
17:04
celebrate 5 years clean in August I have
17:07
been through the system myself here in
17:08
Maran County I had about 15 years in a
17:10
non Maran County Jail one woman actually
17:13
described her own personal story of
17:15
addiction and had it not been for the
17:17
accountability piece when I did get
17:19
clean almost 5 years ago and the fear of
17:22
going back to prison and never seeing my
17:23
son again I wouldn't be sitting here
17:25
today she says the fear of going back to
17:27
prison and not seeing her son was the
17:29
reason that she was motivated to get
17:32
clean H so these are members of the
17:34
community including former drug users
17:36
saying we think decriminalization has
17:39
been a mistake because we need the
17:42
deterrent of criminal charges yeah and
17:46
at the same time opponents are also
17:48
filling these hearing rooms many tonight
17:51
have said that the status quo is not
17:52
working and I agree the status quo is
17:55
not working because there aren't enough
17:56
treatment beds available people said all
17:59
those treatment programs that were
18:01
promised they're still not in place so
18:03
while you can use whatever language you
18:05
want in order to dress up what you're
18:06
doing the fact is what you're choosing
18:08
to do is to place addicts in jail and so
18:11
even if you have a bill that says there
18:13
are off ramps to get people out of jail
18:16
and into treatment those don't yet exist
18:19
and so people will be languishing in
18:21
jail because people are still going to
18:23
die they're just going to die in jail
18:25
cells instead of on a street corner and
18:27
people share again very personal stories
18:30
as the eldest daughter of a woman who
18:32
struggled with addiction almost my
18:33
entire life in overdose 3 years ago I
18:36
know firsthand the need for healing jail
18:39
never worked for my mom people describe
18:42
stories of family members who had been
18:44
addicted and gone through criminal
18:46
convictions and prosecutions and found
18:49
that had not provided them help to get
18:51
them out of their struggles but had
18:52
rather prolonged them as a mother I have
18:55
witnessed my son's struggle with opioid
18:58
use disorder since
19:00
2008 I can say assuredly that the
19:02
biggest barrier to stability my son has
19:05
faced has been his involvement in the
19:08
criminal justice system and it left them
19:11
with trauma and stigma conviction and
19:15
made it harder for them to find
19:16
stability in housing or jobs if drugs
19:18
are re criminalized all it would take is
19:21
one momentary slip for his many years of
19:23
hard work and progress to be lost and
19:27
opponents of the roll back there warning
19:28
that the state is effectively on the
19:30
path here to setting up War on Drugs 2.0
19:34
50 years of the War on Drugs has not
19:37
fixed our addiction crisis 50 years of
19:40
disproportionately harming black and
19:43
brown
19:44
oregonians how will the solutions you
19:46
are proposing be different I heard a lot
19:49
of people in 2020 say that they believe
19:51
black lives matter but you don't if you
19:54
pass something like this you they're
19:56
warning that the racial disparity are
19:58
going to come back and it's going to
19:59
upend lives thank you members anything
20:04
to add before we
20:09
conclude so what ends up being the final
20:13
vote in the legislature the bill passed
20:16
pretty swiftly by wide margins in both
20:19
the house and the Senate and now
20:21
Governor kotek has signaled that she's
20:24
ready to sign it so measure 110 is
20:27
effectively dead now that's right and
20:31
where Mike does that leave the broader
20:35
movement that you described earlier as
20:37
so excited about the passage of 110 in
20:42
Oregon that Advocate who said this was
20:44
taking a sledgehammer to the old regime
20:48
the old War on Drugs I mean what does
20:50
this do to the hopes of decriminalizing
20:54
hard drugs more
20:57
broadly I mean this whole experiment in
20:59
Oregon has really been quite a
21:02
devastating setback to the
21:04
decriminalization movement you know a
21:06
lot of other states were watching Oregon
21:09
to see whether it was a pathway to
21:12
success whether they could replicate the
21:14
model whether they should be the next
21:16
ones to be decriminalizing in their
21:18
state and
21:20
now all of those seem to be off the
21:22
table you know there are not lawmakers
21:25
moving toward decriminalization and same
21:28
with voters you know that ballot
21:30
initiative that Advocates had hoped to
21:32
pass in California did decriminalize
21:34
drugs this year
21:37
now instead it's the opposite Advocates
21:41
are now facing the prospect of battling
21:44
an initiative that would actually
21:46
increase drug penalties you know in
21:49
cities all up and down the West Coast
21:50
there's sort of an effort to crack down
21:53
once again in San Francisco we saw the
21:56
mayor pressing to arrest drug us saying
21:58
that tough love is sometimes needed
22:01
voters there last week approved a
22:04
measure to require drug screening for
22:06
welfare recipients W that's the kind of
22:08
policy we often see Republicans
22:11
proposing not people in a progressive
22:13
City like San Francisco right so there's
22:16
been a major shift here that has served
22:19
as quite the setback for people looking
22:22
to end criminal penalties for those
22:24
possessing drugs but Mike because this
22:27
was such a flawed roll out of measure
22:30
110 in Oregon it feels like it's hard to
22:34
know whether this was a flawed idea I
22:38
mean there's something a little bit
22:39
tragic about it in that sense because
22:42
measure 110 never really functions the
22:44
way it was supposed to have so we don't
22:48
really have a model for a successful
22:50
implementation of decriminalization and
22:53
treatment of hard drugs upon which the
22:55
public can judge whether the basic iic
22:58
of this is sound right and instead we're
23:02
getting a backlash to a poorly executed
23:05
version of this that has seemed to quash
23:08
the entire project yeah when I was down
23:11
at the state capital uh in recent days
23:14
was talking to some lawmakers who said
23:17
that given the lack of the state's
23:19
treatment options back in 2020 Oregon
23:22
was the worst place to try a
23:24
decriminalization experiment h
23:29
some of those lawmakers hope that maybe
23:32
one day once the treatment programs are
23:34
placed and they're working maybe they
23:37
could once again explore removing those
23:41
criminal penalties the argument here
23:43
basically is that in an Ideal World
23:45
somebody would execute a plan like
23:48
measure 110 as it was fully envisioned
23:51
in a place that could supported and then
23:53
we could say whether once and for all
23:56
this actually works or it doesn't
23:58
yeah but it feels like it's going to be
24:00
a long time before we get there
24:02
[Music]
24:16
again well Mike thank you very much we
24:18
appreciate it thank
24:20
[Music]
24:26
you
24:39
[Music]
24:45
we'll be right
24:52
back here's what else you need to know
24:55
today in defiance of their party leader
24:58
Donald Trump House Republicans are
25:00
pushing forward with bipartisan
25:02
legislation that would force the Chinese
25:05
owners of Tik Tok to sell off the
25:08
popular platform or face having it
25:10
banned in the United States both
25:13
Congressional Republicans and Democrats
25:16
argue that Tik Tock is a national
25:18
security threat because of its ties to
25:20
the Chinese government but Trump who was
25:23
highly critical of Tik Tok as president
25:26
now opposes the legislation following a
25:29
meeting a few weeks ago with a major Tik
25:32
Tok
25:33
investor and an effort by the British
25:36
royal family to diffuse rumors about the
25:39
health of Catherine Princess of Wales
25:42
backfired on Monday when she was forced
25:44
to acknowledge that she had digitally
25:46
altered a photograph of herself and her
25:48
children that was released over the
25:50
weekend Catherine who had surgery in
25:53
January has not made any public
25:55
appearances in months setting off Global
25:58
speculation about her well-being the
26:01
release of the photograph appeared timed
26:03
to address those concerns until news
26:06
agencies discovered it had been altered
26:09
in a statement Catherine apologized for
26:12
manipulating the
