A Guilty Verdict For a Mass Shooterâ€™s Mother



0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael aaro this is the
0:06
[Music] daily a few days ago for the first time
0:13
an American Jury convicted a parent for a mass shooting carried out by their
0:19
child my colleague Lisa Miller has been reporting on the case from the beginning
0:25
and explains what the historic verdict really means
0:36
it's Thursday February [Music]
0:42
8th Lisa you came to the story as a writer for New York Magazine two years
Story
0:48
ago you just joined the New York Times I did a couple of days ago basically and you came to the story right after this
0:56
horrible shooting and long before any kind of trial was underway what was
1:02
it that Drew you to this particular case there are so many mass shootings in the United States well first and foremost I
1:09
have covered school shootings and so I'm familiar with all of the pain and Agony
1:14
around these events I covered Sandy Hook I covered Parkland so I've been immersed
1:19
in these cultures for a long time the circumstances of this particular shooting were highly unusual these
1:27
parents James and Jennifer crumble bought their son Ethan who was 15 years old a gun on Black Friday the day after
1:36
Thanksgiving as an early Christmas present the morning of the shooting they
1:41
were called to the school because the child had been drawing these very alarming
1:48
pictures they left the kid at school the kid then shot up the school killing four
1:56
of his classmates and injuring seven other people he was was captured and charged with 24 counts including
2:04
terrorism and charged as an adult the parents were charged several days after
2:11
the shooting with involuntary manslaughter the first time basically in the era of mass shooting school
2:18
shootings that parents were held responsible criminally responsible for what their kid had done in school
2:23
shootings the parents are always sued by the families it's normal but to make
2:29
their actions and inactions a crime was extraordinary and for me this raised all
2:36
of these questions about you know how responsible is a parent for a child's
2:43
criminal acts and what is a parent expected to know or not know about what
2:50
their teenager is doing thinking planning what raises alarms what doesn't raise alarm I mean all of these
2:56
questions are very compelling and murky and they kind of get to the heart of what it means to be parent yep and so as
3:04
I'm thinking about all these big questions I'm also talking to Legal experts in Michigan about the
3:10
prosecutor's case and whether this was a possible case to bring against these
3:16
parents James and Jennifer Crumbley because what they were saying to me what the legal experts were saying was that
3:21
there's this Bedrock principle in US law which is I'm responsible for what I do
3:27
and you're responsible for what you do so how do you put the crumbly parents in
3:32
between Ethan who pulled the trigger and killed four of his classmates and make
3:39
them criminally responsible for those children's deaths especially when he'd
3:44
been charged as an adult so you're saying from the very start you're getting the sense from this reporting
3:51
that this is going to be an uphill prosecution it's an Innovative
3:56
prosecution it's a bold prosecution it's potentially a gamechanging prosecu in this era of mass shootings but just
4:02
practically speaking it's going to be hard to get a guilty verdict yes and
4:07
then I went to the town where this happened Oxford Michigan and when I got
4:13
there my overwhelming impression was twofold that the town reviles these
4:22
parents H they are seen as Outsiders irresponsible and it's a tiny
4:30
22,000 people with four kids dead everybody knows a family who suffered a
4:36
terrible loss and that is palpable it is palpable in the courtroom in the hearing I went to and it is palpable in every
4:42
interview with a parent I had that is the first thing the second thing is that everybody in town owns a gun everybody
4:49
was raised with guns and they talk a lot
4:55
about responsible gun ownership and so the fact that this kid had access to
5:03
this gun is negligence on the part of the parents and I use the word negligence in the Casual non-legal way
5:10
and so as I start watching the trial of Jennifer Crumbley which started a couple of weeks
5:16
ago I know these two things and they are in opposition to each other one is that
5:21
the community is absolutely furious at these parents and especially at the
5:27
mother and the other is the legal experts have told me that this is going to be a really hard case to win right so
5:35
take us into the actual trial of Jennifer Crumbley your honor calling people vers Jennifer Crumbley case
5:41
number 22279 990 FH what's always been so compelling to me about Jennifer
5:48
Crumbley as a character is that you can see her in two entirely different lights
5:53
and the prosecution and the defense are going to describe her complet completely
5:59
differently Jennifer Crumbley didn't pull the trigger that day but she is responsible for those
6:05
deaths so the prosecution is painting a picture of a reckless negligent parent
6:14
who is concerned about everything but the care of her very disturbed son and
6:22
that she had every reason to know that her son was very distressed and so so
6:29
what the prosecution has to do is prove what in the law is called foreseeability
6:35
the school shooter was in a downward spiral that had begun months before
6:41
Jennifer Crumbley was aware of that that Jennifer Crumbley both could have known
6:49
what her son was able to do and could have foreen the harm he was going to
6:56
commit to others one theme will present itself during the Sur it's just how senseless November 30th was and that's
7:03
because of all of the easy ordinary things for someone to
7:09
do that nobody did the other legal term that's important here is a term called
7:16
Ordinary care and what ordinary care means in this case is that an ordinary
7:22
person in the same circumstances would have taken steps to
7:28
intervene okay and how do they attempt to show
7:33
that in testimony right one of the first things they do is they show that she
7:40
knew that her husband had bought their son a gun they show that the gun was
7:46
sold with a cable lock and both her husband and Ethan were given a pamphlet
7:53
about gun safety along with the gun and then an ATF agent took the stand and
8:00
testified that when police officers got to the house after the shooting they
8:05
found that the gun safe was set to 0000 what's significant about 0000 uh that is
8:13
generally the factory default for a lot of uh saves okay that the cable lock
8:19
that had been sold with the gun it looks almost new had never been used M
8:26
Jennifer herself took Ethan to the shooting range who's the surveillance of
8:31
it shows uh Jennifer Crumbley and the shooter entering the gun range on the Saturday after they bought him the gun
8:38
round of it and then they proceed to take turns firing the six hour pistol that Ethan was very experienced with the
8:47
gun this was a semi-automatic 9mm Sig sour and he fired
8:54
many rounds in what's called a shooter stance in other words Jennifer crumbly
9:00
would have understood that her son because she was there was becoming quite proficient yes in shooting a gun yes and
9:07
that there seemed to be a culture of l a fair gun safety in the house and then
9:14
the next person the prosecution brings on the stand is a sheriff's deputy who
9:19
has been through all the fam's texts messages cell phone calls over the past
9:28
year before the and finds basically a documentary of family life you know
9:36
conversations about what's for dinner who's doing what who's picking up who but in the middle of all of those family
9:45
conversations on that same day did you find any text messages from Jennifer's son to her of a concerning nature this
9:50
is March 17th 2021 yes sir there are some texts that show that Ethan is very
10:00
distressed he says okay the house is now haunted and then what some weird [ __ ]
10:05
just happens and now I'm scared he's seeing things there's a demon in the house it's throwing Bowls the word bowls
10:13
is in all caps he's freaked out and then at the end of his description of this
10:19
alleged hallucination he writes can you at least text back can you at least text me back and
10:27
what happens the next response from the defendant to her son is when that two
10:33
days later four the prosecution shows that she does not respond and in fact
10:39
what she's doing at the time is riding horses and taking pictures of herself
10:45
riding horses and the prosecution wants to show that her care for her horses
10:53
exceeds her care for her son in addition
10:59
Ethan had one very very close friend his best friend and the communication
11:04
between Ethan and his friend was constant at all hours of the day and night and in those
11:10
Communications he told his friend that he was falling apart the shooter said I actually asked my dad to take me to the
11:16
doctor yesterday but he just gave me some pills and told me to quote suck it up he wasn't sleeping he was laughing
11:22
and crying in the shower he then says like I am mentally and physically
11:27
dying he thought about calling 911 on himself and at one point he said he told
11:35
his parents that he wanted to go see a doctor then he says my mom laughed when
11:40
I told her there is no evidence that his mom or
The Cigra
11:47
dad saw the texts between Ethan and his friend but the
11:53
prosecution is trying to show that Ethan's mental state was so unraveled so
11:58
distressed that he was completely forthcoming about how
12:04
terrible he felt and that he was asking for help how does the prosecution ultimately
12:10
handle this fateful day of the shooting which you mentioned at the beginning of our
12:17
conversation right well for the prosecution that meeting at the school is the cigra so on the morning of
12:24
November 30th 2021 Jennifer Crumbley is at work and sometime after 9:00 she gets a call from
12:32
the guidance counselor at school and the guidance counselor has texted her a
12:37
drawing that Ethan made on his geometry worksheet that morning on the worksheet
12:44
Ethan has drawn a figure lying in a puddle of blood with bullet holes he's
12:51
written help me I'm paraphrasing the voices won't stop my life is useless
12:59
blood everywhere there's a drawing of a gun that looks very much like the Sig sour
13:06
he and his father bought four days before and Jennifer sees the drawing and
13:14
immediately texts her husband and says you know emergency call me the guidance
13:20
counselor tells Jennifer that she needs to go to the school right away they're
13:26
alarmed they're alarmed and and they go to the guidance counselor's office where
13:31
Ethan is sitting there waiting for them inside the office the guidance counselor testifies that Jennifer is cold she's
13:39
abrupt she doesn't give her son a hug she isn't seemingly concerned in that
13:45
meeting the guidance counselor tells the parents that he believes that Ethan is
13:52
having suicidal ideation and that he needs counseling within 48 Hours sooner
13:58
if possible and one of the points that the prosecutor makes is that neither James
14:05
nor Jennifer raises the fact that they had just
14:12
bought Ethan a gun and that the gun looks very much like the gun that he
14:18
drew on the geometry worksheet right in his testimony the guidance counselor is
14:24
struck by the fact that Jennifer doesn't try to elicit any explanations really
14:31
from Ethan that they don't have any like warm family conversation that they don't act curious
14:38
about his mood or the worksheet that there doesn't seem to be any real
14:46
interrogation of what is going on and then there's a discussion about what to do for the rest of the day and Jennifer
14:54
says well we need to get back to work huh James is driving door dash at the
15:00
time and the prosecution has also shown that Jennifer's workplace is flexible and she could easily take her kid home
15:09
Ethan says he wants to stay at school and so the decision is made to keep
15:15
Ethan at school for the parents to go back to work and within 12 minutes James and
15:25
Jennifer leave the office so when you describe this as the prosecutions
15:31
cigra what I suspect you mean is that this feels like the ultimate moment of
15:38
negligence on the part of Jennifer Crumbley in the prosecution's telling she is uniquely situated in this moment
15:47
to take care of her son to ask him about the gun to intercede in a way that might
15:53
have prevented this from happening and she did not and we all know what happens
15:58
next yeah sometime around lunchtime Ethan goes into the bathroom with the gun in
16:06
his backpack and comes out shooting and at around that time
16:15
James sees police cars screaming toward the school and texts Jennifer and
16:23
Jennifer texts Ethan and what she says is Ethan don't do
16:30
[Music] it and prosecution has always made the
16:37
case that this text from Jennifer to Ethan shows that she knew on some level
16:44
what he was capable of doing and really never intervened at all to prevent him
16:51
from doing
16:57
so [Music] we'll be right
17:05
back so next of course comes the defense in this case tell us about their
The Defense
17:11
argument Smith would you like to make an opening I would thank you Jennifer's lawyer Shannon Smith is a very
17:20
theatrical showy performer who makes references to herself and the messiness
17:27
of her own life all the time on my way to court today I blasted Taylor Swift to
17:35
warm up my voice and Cal my nerves and there was a line in one of her songs
17:41
that summarized what this case is about Band-Aids don't stop bullet holes and
17:48
that's what this case is about it's about the prosecution attempting to put a Band-Aid on problems that can't be
17:56
fixed with a Band-Aid and in her opening statement Smith makes several points the
18:02
prosecution has charged Jennifer Crumbley with involuntary manslaughter in an effort to make the
18:09
community feel better one is that the community wants somebody to blame and
18:17
that that is understandable but that none of those problems will be solved by charging
18:24
Jennifer Crumbley with involuntary manslaughter holding Jennifer
18:31
responsible won't heal the wounds in the town so that's the first thing she says
18:38
the other thing she says which is sort of what the legal experts were saying to me is that the crime is e and he is the
18:45
one as you will see from the evidence he has plad guilty to the crime he has been
18:52
convicted of the crime he has been sentenced and that it's not Jennifer's
18:57
crime and at the end of the day these slivers of evidence will have no
19:03
context and no explanation and the third thing she says is that what the prosecution has done is
19:11
sort of cherry-picked the most egregious texts and phone calls and
19:18
images from a regular family's life but like any of you who look back at text
19:24
messages sent a year ago they may look bad without context
19:29
and explanation Smith is aware that the town that the community reviles the
19:36
crumblies and Jennifer in particular and she pleads with the jury to try to see
19:42
things from her point of view as difficult as that may be and so how does
19:49
the defense approach telling this other version of Jennifer Crumbley hi can you
19:56
start by stating your name it's Jennifer Crumbley so Jennifer is the only witness
20:01
that Shannon Smith calls to the stand and Shannon Smith tries to rebut Point
20:07
by point the prosecution's argument and one of the most important things she has to do is deal with how Ethan got the gun
20:14
are guns your thing not really no okay who is responsible for storing the gun
20:20
my husband is okay and basically Jennifer on the stand says she's not the gun person in the house James is the gun
20:27
guy yeah it was more his thing so I let him handle that I didn't feel comfortable
20:33
putting the lock thing on it he knows how to use the guns he goes with Ethan
20:39
usually to the shooting range that this trip to the shooting range that she took with Ethan was just a one-off and that
20:46
she's not really interested in or involved with guns or gun safety in her
20:52
house she's delegated that to her husband okay what does Jennifer have to
20:57
say about about the prosecution's kind of central claim beyond the gun that she was a
21:05
negligent mother that she was distracted that she was unresponsive especially to
21:11
her son's seemingly you know open please for help Jennifer on the stand refutes
21:18
that completely she calls herself a helicopter parent our biggest struggle with him were missing assignments that
21:25
was the one thing we battled all the time she said she was in constant touch with the school over Ethan's grades she
21:31
was concerned about his grades she drove him around she drove him to bowling he he had bowling practices throughout the
21:37
week bowling matches and he worked part-time in a diner that she was
21:42
extremely involved in his life and Shannon introduced into evidence Jennifer's Facebook pages which showed
21:51
kind of a happy family Halloween we grew our own pumpkins um so we always carved
21:57
and carved our own p pumpkins and had a whole bunch put around the house and it's normal normal family stuff did you
22:03
have um what about the specific idea that Jennifer Crumbley ignored the signs of Ethan's unraveling
22:12
there's that text about demons throwing things in the house please respond can
22:18
you at least text back okay do you recall this date on March 17th
22:26
2021 it didn't stick out to me until this whole no I don't I I don't recall it
22:34
exactly right she insisted that there was nothing there that concerned her why
22:41
didn't they stick out to you because it wasn't it wasn't anything that was
22:46
anything serious it was um Ethan just messing around you got to explain to the jury how did Ethan mess around um so
22:55
he's been convinced our house has been haunted since 2015 so was built in 1920
23:00
she talked about how Ethan had been given a Ouija board for Christmas
23:06
earlier that year and from there there was this sort of longstanding joke SL
23:11
prank about there being ghosts in the house like our house ghost we called it
23:17
my son named it Boris Johnson my husband named it Victoria it was just kind of it
23:22
was just a little phase and they all talked about the ghost as if it were real and a kind of joking prankster way
23:29
that it was a kind of play that was how they talked so this kind of stuff
23:34
between you your son and your husband was like typical joking around kind of
23:40
stuff it was and in her testimony Jennifer crumblyy also said that she
23:46
never thought that her son needed to see a mental health professional that nothing in his
23:54
behavior made her think that he needed one even if the jury accepts that argument
24:00
there's still the question of course of why Jennifer gumbley did what she did or
24:06
what she didn't do when she was called to the school on the day of the shooting so how does she talk about that and how
24:13
does the defense lawyer present it so in her testimony Jennifer says that she
24:20
feels somewhat relieved after that meeting um I thought he wasn't get in trouble for what he drew on his
24:26
assignment as a expecting like a disciplinary meeting she rushed to the school worried
24:34
that her kid was in trouble and she's relieved that Ethan
24:39
isn't in trouble Shannon her lawyer notes that everybody in the room is a
24:46
mandatory reporter which means that if they thought that Ethan was a danger to himself or to others that they could
24:53
call the police or call a state social worker and take take him into custody
24:58
and nobody does that it it was pretty it was pretty nonchalant it was pretty brief um he said that my son told him
25:05
that he was feeling sad over the death of a dog that we had um so we talked we
25:11
talked a little bit about that and so there's this sense at least from Jennifer's point of view that the
25:16
urgency the immediate urgency has been diffused and that everybody can go on
25:22
with their day did you feel like you were taking the position of I am leaving
25:28
him at school whether he can be here or not no absolutely not my son gets very stressed out when he does virtual school
25:34
so we agree that it might stress him out more to do his school remotely the rest
25:39
of the day um that the decision to leave Ethan at school was a decision for his
25:46
safety for his health and that they would deal with what they needed to deal with an on H does Jennifer's lawyer
25:55
bring up the question of the gun the fact as the prosecution has claimed that
26:02
Jennifer Crumley does not Bridge the informational Gap that the school
26:07
officials would have had in that moment that perhaps that drawing Ethan makes on his geometry worksheet is a reference to
26:14
a gun that Jennifer knows the family possesses Jennifer says that she was not
26:22
thinking about there being any danger from the gun mhm you know and Shannon
26:29
her lawyer continually says that the murders are facts in hindsight do you
26:36
believe that you knew or had reason to know your son was a danger to anyone
26:42
else no um as a parent you spend your whole life trying to protect your C your
26:49
child from other dangers you never would think you have to protect your child from harming somebody else that was the
26:55
hardest thing I had to the stomach is that my child harmed and
27:02
killed other people so in a sense what the defense is
The Verdict
27:07
doing here is saying there is no foreseeability when it comes to Jennifer Crumbley yes jury in retrospect this all
27:16
looks perhaps kind of cut and dry these texts these conversations the purchase of the gun all of it and they're saying
27:24
for her in reality in real time it wasn't cut and dry at all and she did
27:29
not think her son was capable of this or that there was anything to stop no and in Shannon's closing remarks she says
27:37
this she says Jennifer one of the first things she says when she goes to the police station after the shooting is you
27:43
know he's a good kid he's never gotten in trouble so as we now know the jury
27:49
rejects this version of Jennifer Crumbley the one who is not negligent
27:54
the one who is a helicopter parent and who couldn't foresee what was happening
27:59
and they find her guilty what was your reaction when you heard that news well
28:06
as I said I really struggled with you know the tension between this fragile
28:12
case that the prosecutors were building that everybody said was a fragile case and the
28:20
overpowering desire of the community to see Jennifer Crumbley in
28:28
prison and the law is there both to
28:35
provide guardrails on Behavior but also to reflect a community's will in some
28:42
way well what does that mean for the future of this type of prosecution this
28:49
was a first it may not be a last but it also I think is a question of whether it
28:55
will become common after a school shooting after a mass shooting involving a young person for a prosecutor to go
29:03
after the parents I mean are the circumstances here so unique that this
29:09
does feel like a new template or an anomaly if I had to pick one of those I
29:18
would lean toward anomaly for several
29:23
reasons one is that the circumstances of this case are so unusual and also that lots and
29:32
lots and lots of kids die from gunshot wounds every year I think the number I
29:40
have is more than 4,000 in 2021 more kids die from gunshot wounds than
29:45
anything else in the country anything else in the country including car crashes so is this how we're going to
29:53
start addressing the problem of guns and gun violence in America by holding
29:58
individual parents accountable I mean maybe it will work as a deterrent but it
30:04
does seem to be trying to circumnavigate the more
30:10
direct approach which is to control access to guns to control guns to
30:16
control who's buying the guns well what's the risk in circumnavigating what
30:21
is clearly an intransigent gun control debate in this
30:27
country that's not going anywhere right the risk is that you start making
30:32
parents responsible criminally responsible not just ethically or morally responsible
30:39
for things that it's very difficult to make parents responsible for
30:45
especially if the kids are teenagers and able to deceive lie manipulate have
30:52
Secret Lives we all know what teenagers are like right and some of the legal experts I spoke to brought up comparable
30:59
situations such as you lend your kid a car the kid gets drunk and kill somebody
31:07
are you criminally responsible for that it just seems like a slippery slope and
31:14
the legal experts are concerned about this is what you're saying that a verdict like this it might be
31:20
emotionally satisfying but as satisfying as a verdict like this might be for some
31:27
legally kind of spiritually it's potentially quite
31:33
problematic yes I think Parenting teenagers is really difficult everybody
31:39
will agree and there's a big distance between being an awful mom and being a
31:49
criminally responsible one and one of the questions I have is you know if you
31:56
start using the crumbly case as a precedent for other parents you know how
32:03
many parents who are good parents will get caught in this
The Mother
32:11
net I spoke to sue cold for the story in New York Magazine she was the mother of
32:16
Dylan cold who was one of the Coline Shooters and she was sort of the
32:23
opposite of Jennifer Crumbley she was up in the middle of the night when her son
32:29
came home from prom and they she was a invested member of the community and she didn't allow guns in the house and she
32:37
told me not only did it still happen but she had no idea none the shooting came
32:46
as a total shock and surprise to her and those boys had been planning it for
32:52
months and 6 months after Coline she was taken to the police station where she was shown tapes that her son and the
32:58
other Shooter had made and she said she didn't recognize
33:05
him and there's all of this evidence that parents are actually some of the
Conclusion
33:12
least insightful observers of their children 50% of kids who make suicide attempts
33:21
it's found that their parents don't know have no idea there was an FBI white paper on S of the profile of the mass
33:29
shooter and it said that parents are some of the least reliable
33:36
reporters of the propensity to do violence like that and I guess one of
33:42
the things that the crumbly case makes me wonder is if this is the model for the future
33:49
is it asking parents to be more cleare eyed about their children than is actually possible
34:00
[Music]
34:05
