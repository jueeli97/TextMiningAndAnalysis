The Accidental Tax Cutter in Chief


0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael babo
0:04
this is the
0:05
[Music]
0:10
daily
0:12
today in his campaign for reelection
0:15
President Biden says that raising taxes
0:18
is at the heart of his
0:20
agenda but as it turns out so far he's
0:24
done the opposite as president my
0:27
colleague Jim tankersley
0:32
explains it's Wednesday April
0:36
[Music]
0:38
3rd Jim welcome back we haven't seen you
0:42
since State of the Union always a
0:44
pleasure so so great to be here and uh
0:46
yeah I finally recovered from staying up
0:48
all night with you guys yeah you don't
0:50
even know all night you stopped and we
0:52
kept going it's true I did I got a I got
0:54
a robust three hours that night you're
0:57
right so Jim in your capacity
1:00
as really the chief economic thinker
1:03
covering this President you recently
1:06
came across something very surprising
1:09
yeah it started with a pretty basic
1:11
question for me I I like to do this
1:13
crazy thing Michael where I like to take
1:16
candidates promises and see if they've
1:17
come true insane it's a little bit wild
1:20
but it's it's what I do for fun and in
1:23
this case I wanted to look at a very
1:25
Central promise of President Biden's
1:27
campaign in 2020 which he has reped
1:30
while in office I promise you I
1:33
guarantee you we can build back and
1:35
build back better with the economy the
1:37
rewards work not wealth the promise was
1:40
he was going to raise taxes but I tell
1:43
you what I'm going to do and I make no
1:45
apologies for it I'm going to ask the
1:47
wealthiest Americans and the biggest
1:49
corporations of the Fortune 500
1:52
companies
1:53
91 making a collective billions of
1:56
dollars didn't pay a single solitary
1:59
penny in tax not taxes on the middle
2:02
class not taxes on low-income workers
2:05
but he was going to raise taxes on
2:07
corporations and the rich but I'm going
2:09
to make sure they pay their fair share
2:12
he was going to make them pay their fair
2:14
share and he leaned into it guess what
2:18
you're going to start paying your fair
2:19
share I'm going to ask him to finally
2:21
begin to pay the fair share not a
2:23
punishment pay your fair share he said
2:26
it over and over fair share translation
2:29
it's back to the failed policies of the
2:31
1970s Republicans loved this they
2:34
repeated it too they told voters that
2:37
the president was going to raise taxes
2:39
Joe Biden bragging about raising taxes
2:41
on corporations that means less money
2:43
for those very employers to hire people
2:45
back they talked about you know all the
2:47
ways in which corporate tax increases
2:49
could rebound on workers Joe Biden will
2:51
shut down your economy raise taxes want
2:55
a $4 trillion tax increase he's the only
2:59
politician I've ever seen who said we
3:02
will raise your taxes you're supposed to
3:05
it was a very big part of the economic
3:07
debate for the campaign right and I
3:09
wanted to know is that true has that
3:11
actually played out in the policy agenda
3:15
the president has had mhm so I asked
3:18
some economists at the tax policy Center
3:21
in Washington to run an analysis and
3:23
just say let's look at all of the ways
3:26
Biden has changed the tax code in all of
3:28
those laws he signed and ask has he
3:32
raised taxes as president and it turns
3:35
out the answer is he has not raised
3:37
taxes on net he has cut more taxes than
3:41
he's raised how much more has he cut
3:44
taxes than raised them so by the math
3:47
that economists use when they look at
3:49
budgets the traditional way of scoring
3:52
tax changes he has cut taxes by $600
3:58
billion on net hm a lot of money a lot
4:01
of tax cuts it's a lot of tax cuts the
4:03
president has been a net tax cutter so
4:06
Jim why and how did Biden end up cutting
4:10
taxes especially if his stated intent
4:13
was to raise taxes well there's two
4:16
sides of this equation and sort of two
4:20
complimentary explanations for what's
4:21
happened here the first side is the tax
4:24
increases that Biden ran on he's only
4:27
done a couple of them he has has
4:30
trillions of dollars of ideas for how to
4:33
raise taxes on rich people and
4:35
corporations the treasury Department
4:37
publishes an entire book full of them
4:39
every year called the green book but in
4:41
the actual legislation he signed there's
4:43
only been a couple really there was a
4:45
tax on stock BuyBacks that companies do
4:48
and then a new minimum tax for certain
4:51
multinational corporations that have
4:53
very low tax rates those add up to real
4:56
money but they are not in the grand
4:58
scheme of BU tax increases a really
5:02
large amount of the agenda he's proposed
5:05
MH so explanation number one he just
5:07
hasn't been that successful in passing
5:09
tax increases and there's a lot of
5:11
reasons for that the biggest one is just
5:14
the simplest one is that he's just had a
5:16
really hard time
5:17
persuading members of Congress including
5:20
Democrats to back some of his favorite
5:22
tax increases you know he wants to raise
5:25
the corporate income tax rate which
5:28
president Trump cut in his 2017 tax bill
5:31
Biden wants to raise it to 28% from 21%
5:35
Congress has not had any appetite to go
5:37
along with that he wanted to get rid of
5:39
What's called the carried interest
5:40
loophole like a longtime white whale of
5:44
democratic policymaking but he could not
5:46
get even 50 Democrats to go along with
5:48
that Senator kirston Cinema of Arizona
5:50
was opposed to it and so it didn't get
5:52
included right and he did some pieces of
5:55
legislation on a bipartisan basis and in
5:57
those cases Republicans were just not
5:59
not going to pay for anything by raising
6:02
taxes and so he had to take those off
6:04
the table there so it's all added up to
6:07
just not very much activity in Congress
6:09
to raise taxes on what Biden wants to do
6:12
got it so that's the side of a ledger
6:13
where Biden simply fails to increase
6:16
taxes because he can't get Congress to
6:18
increase taxes right but there's another
6:20
side which is also that Biden has signed
6:23
into law a decent number of tax cuts
6:27
H and that starts from the very
6:29
beginning just a couple months into his
6:31
presidency if you'll recall we're still
6:33
in the depths of the covid-19 pandemic
6:36
the economy is wobbling after it had
6:39
started to rebound Biden proposes what
6:41
is essentially a stimulus bill right and
6:44
he includes some tax cuts in there a tax
6:47
cut for families a child tax credit and
6:50
it also includes you remember those
6:52
direct checks that people got as part of
6:54
that Bill yes $1,400 I remember them yes
6:58
those were technically tax cuts hm so
7:00
the stimulus Bill starts with that the
7:02
next year he passes this bill that is
7:05
trying to accelerate manufacturing of
7:07
things like semiconductors in the United
7:09
States that's the chips act and that
7:11
includes some corporate tax cuts for
7:13
companies that invest in the kind of
7:16
manufacturing that Biden wants this is
7:18
industrial policy via carrots for
7:22
corporations and Biden is handing them
7:24
out as part of this bill so tax cuts
7:27
there and then finally the inflation
7:29
reduction act which is includes the
7:32
largest climate effort in American
7:35
history is a bunch of corporate tax cuts
7:38
at its core tax cuts for manufacturing
7:41
of solar panels tax cuts for people to
7:44
buy electric vehicles tax cuts for all
7:47
sorts of things tied to the transition
7:50
from fossil fuels to lower emission
7:53
sources of energy and those tax cuts add
7:56
up they add up for corporations they add
7:58
up for individual
8:00
and in the end that full Suite of tax
8:03
cuts that he's passed across all of this
8:05
legislation
8:07
outweighs the modest tax increases that
8:10
were also included in the inflation
8:11
reduction act to reduce its
8:13
[Music]
8:17
cost got it so a very big reason why
8:20
Biden ends up cutting taxes beyond the
8:22
fact that he's not able to raise them
8:23
through Congress is that that's what it
8:25
took according to those in his
8:28
administration to get American industry
8:31
and American consumers to change their
8:34
behavior in line with policy goals such
8:36
as getting more domestic computer ship
8:38
manufacturing and getting more people to
8:40
buy electric vehicles they decided the
8:43
way to do that was to give people tax
8:45
breaks which means he cut their taxes
8:47
right people and companies the the
8:49
president certainly has talked
8:50
throughout the campaign about wanting to
8:52
give middle class families a break but
8:54
he has also in the process of crafting
8:57
policy really come to rely on tax cuts
9:01
for people and for corporations as a way
9:04
of achieving these policy goals and in
9:06
many cases again this is what he had to
9:08
do to pass these bills through even
9:11
Democrats in Congress you know Senator
9:14
Joe Mansion of West Virginia didn't want
9:17
to just send money to companies that
9:19
were making solar panels he wanted there
9:22
to be tax incentives for it and so that
9:25
is part of the reason why these were
9:27
created as tax incentives and so all
9:29
this adds up to more of a tax cutting
9:32
record than you might have imagined when
9:33
Biden was on the campaign Trail I'm
9:35
curious who really ended up benefiting
9:39
from these tax cuts you said they went
9:41
to people and to corporations but on the
9:43
whole did they end up reaching lower
9:46
inome Americans middle- inome Americans
9:49
or the rich well we don't have a full
9:52
distributional analysis which is what
9:54
you're asking for of of the entirety of
9:56
Biden's tax changes but but we can say
9:58
this particularly the ones that were in
10:01
that early stimulus Bill the recovery
10:04
plan MH those were very much targeted
10:07
toward lower income and middle inome
10:09
Americans there were income limits on
10:12
who could get things like the child tax
10:14
credit obviously the direct payments
10:15
went to people who were middle class or
10:17
less so the analysis of that would
10:20
suggest that these were tax cuts for
10:21
lower income people for middle class
10:23
people and on the flip side what I think
10:26
we are likely to see with the electric
10:29
vehicle credit through the inflation
10:30
reduction Act is that while there are
10:32
some income limits on who can qualify
10:34
for that credit that the people who end
10:37
up claiming that credit tend to be the
10:39
higher earners among the people who
10:41
qualify right who buys a Tesla after all
10:44
somebody with a fair amount of money
10:45
right exactly and of course the
10:47
corporate tax cuts go to companies flow
10:49
through to their shareholders there's a
10:51
huge debate in the academic literature
10:53
among politicians about how much of that
10:55
benefit actually ends up going to their
10:57
workers versus stays with sh holders but
11:00
we can broadly say that Joe Biden has
11:03
has done a lot for certain corporations
11:06
who are trying to advance his
11:09
manufacturing goals in particular to
11:11
reduce their tax bills and that is
11:13
certainly not in line with the rhetoric
11:16
you hear him talking about most of the
11:17
time about making corporations pay their
11:19
fair share and the White House
11:20
acknowledges this I I asked them about
11:22
it and they basically said you know we
11:24
think there's a difference between just
11:26
cutting the corporate tax rate in a way
11:28
that helps anybody no matter what
11:29
they're doing and what we're trying to
11:31
do which is basically reward
11:33
corporations for accelerating the energy
11:35
transition understood but where does
11:38
this ultimately leave Biden's campaign
11:41
promise to make the tax code fairer and
11:45
to make sure that the well-off in
11:46
particular and corporations are paying
11:50
their what he called fair share I think
11:53
by Biden's own measurements by his own
11:56
Ambitions he would have to agree that he
11:58
is nowhere close to what he believes
12:00
would be a fair share for corporations
12:03
because Biden is still running on this
12:07
as he enters his reelection campaign as
12:09
it really heats up a rematch with Donald
12:11
Trump the president is really leaning
12:14
into this message of we need to do more
12:17
we need to raise more taxes on Corporate
12:19
America it is time for these companies
12:21
and for high earners to pay their fair
12:23
share right I didn't get it done in the
12:25
first term but if you elect me I'll get
12:27
it done in the second give me another
12:29
shot and this time I promise we'll be
12:34
[Music]
12:43
different we'll be right
12:46
[Music]
12:58
back
13:04
so Jim let's talk about Biden's tax
13:06
raising plans for a theoretical second
13:08
term and why anyone should have any
13:11
faith that he could get it done if
13:13
there's a second term given the
13:14
experience so far of his first term yeah
13:17
well man there's a lot of plans to talk
13:19
about I don't think we can get through
13:20
all of them but we can certainly hit the
13:22
highlights here so we can start with the
13:25
couple of things that Biden has been
13:27
able to do to raise tax on corporations
13:30
he sort of like wants to take those and
13:32
then plus them up how so he's put this
13:35
new minimum tax on corporations it's a
13:37
15% minimum tax on certain
13:39
multinationals he now wants to raise
13:41
that to
13:42
21% he wants to take that corporate
13:45
stock buyback tax which is 1% right now
13:47
and he'd like to quadruple it to 4% and
13:50
then he goes after you know some things
13:52
large and small he wants to do new taxes
13:54
that hit the use of corporate and
13:56
private jets he wants to do new taxes on
13:59
companies that pay large amounts of
14:01
compensation to their Executives MH and
14:04
then we get to some really big taxes on
14:06
high earning individuals so the
14:09
president has said over and over again
14:11
he won't raise taxes on anyone making
14:13
less than $400,000 a year but he's got a
14:16
bunch of taxes for the people above that
14:18
so he wants to raise the top marginal
14:21
income tax rate he wants to take it from
14:23
37% which is the level set by President
14:27
Trump's 2017 tax law and bring get back
14:29
to 39.6% which is what it was before he
14:33
also wants to impose what he calls a
14:35
Billionaire's tax okay it's a 25% tax on
14:41
the total value of all of the assets of
14:44
anyone worth more than $100 million okay
14:47
wait I have several questions about this
14:49
please first being a fact check if it's
14:51
a Billionaire's tax it's interesting
14:52
that it's going after people who have
14:55
just 100 million yeah I think most
14:57
billionaires would be offended at the
14:59
inclusion of 100 million SS in that yes
15:01
totally agree that is factually
15:03
inaccurate the name right but beyond
15:05
that this sounds very much like a wealth
15:07
tax which we don't really have in our
15:09
system yeah it's a sort of wealth tax
15:11
the Biden people don't call it a wealth
15:13
tax but it is a tax on something other
15:16
than income that you report every year
15:20
to the IRS as having been earned it goes
15:23
beyond just oh I got interest from my
15:25
stock Holdings or I made money from my
15:29
job it's oh the value of my art
15:31
collection increased last year and now
15:33
Biden's going to tax me on that increase
15:35
even if I didn't sell the art that's a
15:37
real change and that reflects the
15:39
president's view that people with enough
15:42
money to buy enormous art collections
15:45
that appreciate enormously in value
15:46
should be paying more in taxes right and
15:48
of course a tax like this is extremely
15:51
perhaps maddeningly hard to actually
15:53
pull off it's hard to get someone to
15:55
describe their art collection's value so
15:56
that you can apply a 25% tax to it so
15:59
this might end up being more of a
16:01
political statement than a practical tax
16:04
yeah there's also questions about
16:05
whether it's constitutional so there's
16:07
all sorts of drama around this proposal
16:10
but it is certainly if nothing else a
16:12
statement of the president's intent to
16:14
make people worth a lot of money pay a
16:17
lot more in taxes okay so that's a lot
16:19
of proposed tax increases almost all of
16:22
them focused on those who are rich and
16:26
corporations overall Jim what stands out
16:29
to you about this Biden term 2 tax
16:33
increase plan I think we could very
16:35
fairly say that it's the largest tax
16:38
increasing plan by a sitting president
16:41
or a Presidential nominee for a party in
16:43
American history wow he wants to get a
16:45
lot of money from corporations and
16:47
people who earn or are worth a lot of
16:50
money but the rub of course is it's hard
16:54
to see the Congressional math that lets
16:56
Biden accomplish these tax increases
17:00
some of which like you said he couldn't
17:01
get done the first time why would we
17:02
think he would get them done the second
17:04
time even if he wins this fall yeah it
17:07
would be really difficult Biden would
17:09
have to win in November Democrats would
17:12
have to take the House of
17:13
Representatives back from Republicans
17:16
which is certainly possible it's very
17:17
closely divided right now Y and they
17:19
need to hold at least 50 seats in the
17:21
Senate and then those 50 Democrats in
17:23
the Senate would have to be willing to
17:25
go along with Far More in tax increases
17:28
than Democrats were last time around so
17:31
if there is a second term it feels like
17:33
we should assume it will be very
17:35
difficult perhaps even quite unlikely
17:37
he's going to get to push through a lot
17:39
of these taxes which makes me wonder Jim
17:42
why is Biden running on a tax program
17:45
that he knows has so little chance of
17:48
becoming reality and when it's pretty
17:51
clear that he's gotten a lot of stuff
17:53
done without raising taxes it turns out
17:56
it's not been all that essential to
17:57
getting infrastructure or climate bills
18:00
done so why is he making this so Central
18:02
several reasons one of them is that it's
18:05
very important to him rhetorically to
18:08
talk about fiscal
18:09
responsibility big parts of the Biden
18:11
agenda the chips Bill the infrastructure
18:14
Bill some other legislation were not
18:17
actually paid for the spending and tax
18:19
cuts were not offset by tax increases so
18:22
they're going to add to the debt right
18:23
so they're going to add to the debt same
18:24
is true of the stimulus bill but moving
18:26
forward the president has said that he's
18:28
going to pay for his agenda and he's
18:30
actually going to have some extra tax
18:31
dollars coming in left over to help pay
18:33
down future budget deficits and on paper
18:36
it's the way to pay for Biden's other
18:38
big expansive plans that he hasn't been
18:40
able to do what wants to Universal Child
18:43
Care Federal paid leave investing in
18:45
Elder Care just a whole bunch of things
18:47
that he still wants to do more housing
18:49
initiatives the president needs money to
18:51
make a case that he's being fiscally
18:53
responsible and this is the money that
18:55
would do that got it so that's one
18:57
reason another reason is the calendar
19:00
Biden and his team are looking ahead to
19:02
the end of 2025 and they know that if he
19:06
wins another term he will be in office
19:09
at a rare moment in Washington when
19:12
basically tax policy has to be on the
19:15
Congressional agenda why well
19:18
Republicans when they passed their tax
19:20
cuts in 2017 set a bunch of them to
19:23
expire at the end of 2025 in order to
19:26
lower the cost of the bill these are the
19:28
Trump tax cuts the Trump tax cuts and
19:31
that includes all the tax cuts for
19:32
individuals so now that those are coming
19:36
due there's going to be a fight in
19:38
Washington over whether to extend them
19:40
or make them permanent or change them in
19:42
some way or just let them expire and
19:44
Democrats know there's going to be a
19:47
huge fight that will reach almost
19:49
certainly the floor of the house and the
19:51
Senate and so Biden wants to be ready he
19:54
wants to be ready with a suite of policy
19:57
proposals the Democrats can basically
19:59
pull off the shelf and try to use to put
20:02
Republicans in a box basically say we
20:05
would like to keep taxes low or cut them
20:08
further for low-income workers middle
20:10
class workers but we want to pay for
20:13
that by raising taxes on the rich you
20:16
Republicans also want to do nice things
20:19
for low and middle class workers but you
20:21
want to cut taxes for corporations and
20:23
the rich and we think that's a political
20:24
loser for you so Biden is ready with
20:27
what they think will be AIT winner for
20:29
Democrats in this almost certain floor
20:33
tax fight at the end of 2025 got it and
20:36
that sort of brings us to the last
20:39
reason why Biden is doing this and maybe
20:42
the most important which is it's really
20:45
good politics H just explain that why is
20:48
talking about tax increases net tax
20:51
increases such good politics if you talk
20:54
to democratic pollsters if you talk to
20:58
people inside the White House outside
20:59
the White House political strategists
21:01
anywhere in Biden's orbit they all agree
21:04
that the public loves the idea of
21:08
forcing rich people and corporations to
21:12
pay their quote fair share it's just
21:15
become a winning and Central political
21:18
argument in Democratic campaigns the
21:20
idea that corporations avoid taxes that
21:23
rich people avoid taxes and that you
21:26
know Joe Biden is trying to position
21:27
himself as a champion of the idea that
21:30
they need to pay more those corporations
21:32
and those rich people need to pay more
21:33
and he's going to make it happen you're
21:35
describing this as something that is
21:37
kind of a new political reality is that
21:41
right yeah it's sort of evolved over the
21:43
last decade or so I think you know for a
21:45
long time in Washington the conventional
21:47
wisdom was you just couldn't talk about
21:49
tax increases of any kind they were
21:52
poison there was a whole anti-tax
21:54
movement that did a really good job of
21:56
messaging that and Democratic candidates
21:58
got very scared of talking about raising
22:01
taxes even on the very very rich that
22:04
started to turn over time but it's
22:07
really changed I think you know we saw
22:08
in the 2020 election that the Democratic
22:11
primary had just enormous amounts of
22:14
taxes on corporations and the rich
22:16
funding all sorts of policy proposals
22:18
Medicare for all and Universal child
22:21
care and trillions and trillions of
22:23
dollars and Democratic candidates like
22:24
Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders sort of
22:26
competing to see who could tax
22:28
corporations and the rich the most Biden
22:31
is sort of a product of that primary he
22:33
was one of the most moderate people in
22:36
that group but his proposals are really
22:39
outside of the historical Norm for
22:41
Democratic candidates up until then and
22:43
that reflects the fact that pollsters
22:45
have been doing all this research
22:47
finding that the American people
22:49
including Independents and increasingly
22:50
numbers of Republicans just don't think
22:53
corporations pay their fair share and
22:54
are open to the idea they should pay
22:56
more this is really interesting it makes
22:58
me think that what you're really saying
22:59
is that there might have been a time
23:01
when a democratic nominee like Joe Biden
23:04
might have reveled In His Image as an
23:07
overall tax gutter but that is not this
23:11
moment and that is not this candidate he
23:14
wants to be a tax increaser he thinks
23:17
that is where the politics are I think
23:20
that's exactly right when you think
23:22
about tax increaser as tax increaser on
23:25
the rich and on corporations mhm you
23:28
know sort of two ways to be a successful
23:30
populist politician right one of them is
23:33
to be kind of like Trump and run around
23:36
saying you're to do enormous tax cuts
23:37
for everybody which is sort of a
23:39
republican version of populism Trump my
23:42
biggest tax cut in history I'm going to
23:43
do another huge enormous tax cut it's
23:45
going to be so big you won't believe it
23:47
there might have been a time when
23:48
Democrats tried to follow that Playbook
23:51
but Biden's not doing that he's leaning
23:53
into the other side of populism he's
23:56
telling workers hey I'm on your side
23:59
with these big companies they're trying
24:01
to screw you and I'm not going to stand
24:03
for it and so I'm going to raise their
24:05
taxes I'm going to make them pay more so
24:08
that there's more money for you whether
24:10
that's more tax cuts or more programs or
24:12
whatever and that is sort of the
24:14
democratic version of populism right now
24:16
and that's the one that Joe Biden is
24:17
running on and that's why he's so happy
24:20
to talk about raising corporate taxes
24:22
because it's a way to tell workers hey
24:24
I'm on your side right even if that's
24:27
not what he's done or ever may be able
24:29
to do
24:32
yeah part of the problem with populism
24:34
is that you make a lot of promises you
24:35
can't keep and this certainly in in his
24:38
first term has been an area where the
24:39
president has talked a much bigger game
24:41
than he's been able to execute second
24:43
term might be different but that doesn't
24:45
really matter for the campaign what
24:47
matters is is the
24:52
