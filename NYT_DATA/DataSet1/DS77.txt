Democratsâ€™ Plan to Save the Republican House Speaker



0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael Boro
0:04
this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:09
daily today Against All Odds and
0:13
expectations Republican house Speaker
0:16
Mike Johnson keeps managing to fund the
0:19
government inflame the farri of his
0:22
party and still hold on to his job now
0:26
as he prepares for his riskiest move to
0:29
date I speak with my colleague Katie
0:31
Edmonson about why it may be Democrats
0:35
who save his
0:38
[Music]
0:40
[Applause]
0:42
speakership it's Wednesday March
0:46
[Music]
0:55
27th Katie I'd like to start with this
0:58
dramatic scene that played out
1:00
in the House of Representatives a few
1:02
days ago you happen to be in the room
1:04
for it so just describe it that's right
1:06
well I was sitting in the Press Gallery
1:08
in the house chamber Friday morning
1:11
watching for a spending vote to go
1:13
through and instead what caught my
1:15
attention was congresswoman margorie
1:18
Taylor green the farri lawmaker from
1:20
Georgia striding down the center of the
1:24
aisle on the house floor and she marched
1:26
up to the house Clerk's desk and she put
1:28
a piece of paper in into the Hopper into
1:31
the basket for legislation that sits on
1:34
the house Clerk's desk mhm it
1:36
immediately set off a rumor mail about
1:39
what that piece of paper potentially
1:41
could be and sure enough minutes later
1:43
we learned that she was essentially
1:45
taking the first step in the process to
1:47
call a snap vote to OU speaker Mike
1:52
Johnson and minutes later congresswoman
1:56
green walks Down The House steps where I
1:58
and a number of other reporters were
2:00
waiting uh this is a betrayal of the
2:02
American people this is a betrayal of
2:04
Republican voters and she said what set
2:06
this into motion was that speaker Mike
2:09
Johnson had just again relied on
2:11
Democrats to push through a spending
2:14
Bill to keep the government funded this
2:16
bill was basically a dream and a and a
2:19
wish list for Democrats and for the
2:20
white house uh it was completely led by
2:23
Chuck Schumer not our Republican speaker
2:25
of the house that many Republicans in
2:28
fact a majority of Republicans in the
2:30
conference opposed our country is in
2:32
crisis and we need real leaders that
2:35
know how to fight that know how to walk
2:37
in a room and don't get rolled by the
2:39
Deep State and don't get rolled by the
2:42
Democrats and she said that Mike Johnson
2:44
needed to be put on notice I am saying
2:46
the clock has started it's time for our
2:48
conference to choose a new speaker do
2:50
you believe that
2:54
areans at which point those of us
2:56
watching from home are all thinking to
2:57
ourselves here we go again we are are
3:00
about to lose another house speaker to
3:05
angry farri House Republicans who of
3:08
course deposed the last speaker Kevin
3:09
McCarthy in the fall for similar
3:14
ideological offenses not being far right
3:17
enough on first glance it does seem like
3:20
a case of deja vu but I actually think
3:23
that this instance is going to turn out
3:26
to be very different than the last
3:28
iteration of this we saw with speaker
3:30
Kevin McCarthy H why would that be Katie
3:33
why do we think it's not going to be the
3:35
deja vu that it really looks like well I
3:38
think to understand the full Arc or the
3:41
full trajectory of his speakership we
3:43
kind of have to rewind back to when he
3:45
was initially elected speaker and if you
3:48
remember when he was elected in October
3:51
this was seen as a really big victory
3:53
for the far right as a rank and file
3:56
member Congressman Mike Johnson was
4:00
super conservative a super Evangelical
4:03
Christian anti-abortion anti-s spending
4:06
far-right Republicans felt that they had
4:09
just elected really one of their own to
4:11
the speakership someone who was going to
4:14
bow to their preferences and bring them
4:17
to the table in a way that they felt
4:19
speaker Kevin McCarthy never really did
4:22
and we got our first test as to how
4:25
speaker Johnson was going to manage the
4:28
far right flank of of his conference
4:30
almost immediately when he had to decide
4:34
whether he was going to keep the
4:35
government funded right this was exactly
4:37
the same situation that Kevin McCarthy
4:39
found himself in that's right and look
4:41
it was not a foregone conclusion that he
4:43
would follow in former speaker Kevin
4:45
McCarthy's footsteps I had questions
4:47
when he was initially elected as to
4:49
whether he would let parts of the
4:51
government shut down whether he would
4:53
allow a total government shutdown to
4:55
show the farri right that he really was
4:57
one of them to show that he was going to
4:59
put up this
5:01
[Music]
5:02
fight and in fact he did the opposite
5:06
over and over again over the next 5
5:09
months when he was faced repeatedly with
5:11
these funding
5:13
[Music]
5:14
deadlines each time he made the
5:16
calculation we are not going to let the
5:18
government shut down he made the
5:20
calculation that if he wanted to keep
5:22
the government funded he knew with his
5:24
razor thin majority he was going to have
5:26
to turn to democrats for votes and that
5:29
what he
5:31
did right and what you had told us when
5:34
that was happening was allowances were
5:36
being made for Johnson from the far
5:39
right because he was one of them but the
5:42
question was how long could he claim to
5:44
be one of the far right when he was
5:46
repeatedly in their eyes betraying them
5:49
by working with Democrats to get
5:51
spending bills passed that this far
5:53
right group of lawmakers hated yeah
5:56
that's right Congress ended up having to
5:58
pass all of these short term stop Gap
6:01
spending bills to keep the government
6:02
funded they kept kicking the can down
6:04
the road and that brings us to this vote
6:08
on Friday on the latest spending bill
6:11
that he had to push through it was the
6:13
final package to make sure the
6:14
government is funded through this fiscal
6:17
[Music]
6:19
year this package included bills to fund
6:22
the Department of Homeland Security
6:24
which obviously has been a huge touch
6:26
point for them in terms of their
6:28
dissatisfaction with what's happening at
6:30
the southern border so this was always
6:33
going to be a very politically tricky
6:36
tranch of packages for negotiators to
6:39
get through and what ends up being
6:42
proposed in this final spending Bill to
6:45
keep the government open well it ends up
6:49
looking kind of like an old school
6:50
compromise bill in that no one is
6:53
entirely happy with it but that there
6:56
are wins for both parties to take home
6:59
and sell to their base and so for
7:02
Democrats they got uh $1 billion in new
7:06
spending for child care subsidies for
7:09
lowincome families for Head Start Early
7:12
Education and for conservatives there
7:15
was a lot of additional money in this
7:17
bill to beef up security at the southern
7:20
border so that was more money for
7:22
additional border patrol officers more
7:25
money for additional detention beds for
7:28
immigration enforcement
7:30
facilities so on paper it seems as
7:33
though you know this is a bill that at
7:35
least moderate or more Centrist
7:37
Republicans will be able to get behind
7:39
right but in fact what we see on the
7:42
house floor when this bill is put to a
7:44
vote is that not only do the farri
7:47
Republicans in the conference oppose it
7:49
but actually a majority of speaker Mike
7:52
Johnson's conference opposes the bill
7:55
and why was that well I think part of it
7:57
is simply the Topline number $1.2
8:00
trillion was the price tag on this bill
8:04
and that is just a really big number for
8:06
lawmakers to wrap their heads around
8:08
particularly if you are a conservative
8:11
member who has been saying for months
8:13
that you want the Republican speaker to
8:15
use their gavel to try to reduce federal
8:18
spending got it and so in order to pass
8:21
this bill speaker Johnson again relies
8:23
on almost all Democrats really to push
8:26
this through and when the vote is and
8:29
tallied we see that more than half of
8:32
his conference has in fact opposed this
8:35
spill they voted it down right what you
8:37
have told us in the past ktie is an
8:38
important mathematical equation when
8:42
less than half of Republicans vote on
8:44
something proposed by a republican
8:46
speaker it is basically considered the
8:48
political equivalent of a cardinal sin
8:51
yeah that's right I mean The Unofficial
8:53
rule within the house Republican
8:55
conference is that a republican speaker
8:57
is not even supposed to elow a vote on
9:00
legislation if he knows that less than
9:02
half of his conference supports it so
9:05
that's how we get to Marjorie Taylor
9:06
green putting this piece of paper in the
9:09
hopper starting this process of
9:12
attempting to oust speaker Johnson yeah
9:15
that's right so we're back to this
9:16
question of why isn't this likely to be
9:20
the beginning of the end for Johnson it
9:23
certainly looks like he has done the
9:25
deed that would cost him his job here
9:27
well one of the interesting things about
9:29
this whole situation is that
9:31
congresswoman green has intentionally
9:34
structured this bill that she filed to
9:38
essentially leave this threat lingering
9:40
over speaker Mike Johnson's head this is
9:43
going to be a slow boil she's not
9:44
calling for an immediate snap vote she's
9:47
going to kind of let it linger and let
9:49
him squirm a little bit right but the
9:53
other thing is that it's not clear that
9:55
the math is on her side obviously after
9:58
she did this we immediately went and
10:00
asked Republicans who voted to OU
10:03
McCarthy if they were on board for a
10:06
second go essentially and a lot of them
10:09
were very squeamish about the idea it's
10:13
very unclear whether margorie Taylor
10:15
green even has the support within the
10:17
Republican conference to oust Mike
10:19
Johnson but of course if you remember a
10:21
huge factor in all of this is what
10:23
Democrats decide to do right when it
10:26
came to the ouster of speaker Kevin
10:28
McCarthy Democrats ultimately decided
10:31
sure we're going to join in with this
10:33
motion to oust him and it's not clear
10:36
that that's the case for Mike Johnson at
10:38
all and in fact there have been
10:40
conversations internally among democrats
10:43
for weeks even before margorie Taylor
10:46
green files this resolution talking
10:48
about maybe they should try to save him
10:51
if someone does try to OU him and why
10:55
would that be because it's deeply
10:58
unintuitive Democrats trying to save
11:01
this house Speaker they didn't do it
11:03
last time why would they do it with
11:05
Johnson well the first thing to say is
11:07
that honestly a lot of Democrats
11:10
genuinely and personally despised former
11:13
speaker Kevin McCarthy in a way that
11:16
they don't with speaker Mike Johnson
11:18
Hakeem Jeff told us last month that they
11:20
view Mike Johnson as more of a blank
11:23
slate but it goes beyond
11:26
[Music]
11:27
that I don't think Democrats would save
11:31
Mike Johnson for free so to speak and
11:34
what would be their price well their
11:36
price would be for speaker Mike Johnson
11:39
to allow aid for Ukraine to come to a
11:42
vote on the house floor this is a huge
11:45
priority for Democrats to make sure that
11:47
the United States continues to help ke
11:50
fend off Russian aggression that they
11:53
are now talking about if speaker Johnson
11:55
were to allow that to come to a vote if
11:57
it were to pass it might be enough for
12:00
them to cross party lines and vote to
12:03
save Mike Johnson if a republican tried
12:06
to oust
12:09
him we'll be right
12:11
[Music]
12:16
back Katie you just said that speaker
12:18
Johnson might end up being saved by
12:20
house Democrats because he may push
12:23
through funding for Ukraine but my
12:26
recollection is that speaker Johnson has
12:28
been hugely res resistant to passing
12:31
funding for Ukraine he's avoided doing
12:33
it over and over and over again so help
12:36
me understand that that's right as a
12:38
rank and file Congressman he repeatedly
12:41
voted against sending Aid to Ukraine and
12:44
within the first few months of his
12:46
speakership we saw it was an issue that
12:49
he just really did not want to touch
12:51
that he did not want to bring up aid for
12:53
a vote really did not want to talk too
12:55
much about his thinking on it but over
12:57
the past few weeks we started to see
12:59
some of his calculations on Ukraine
13:02
start to change H in what way well it's
13:05
been kind of interesting to watch the
13:08
tight RPP that he's walking here because
13:11
publicly initially he was keeping his
13:13
statements very vague he never really
13:15
wanted to address Ukraine AIDS
13:18
specifically but I started to hear in
13:21
private conversations behind closed
13:23
doors he started sounding much more
13:26
sympathetic to the plight of the
13:28
Ukrainian Ians that he started
13:30
telegraphing a willingness to put some
13:33
type of Aid package for Ukraine on the
13:36
house floor H I heard from a donor for
13:40
example who attended a fundraiser last
13:43
month that the speaker attended in which
13:46
he gave what sounded like really kind of
13:49
a rousing monologue about how he is a
13:52
Reagan Republican he believes in peace
13:55
through strength he believes the United
13:58
States has a role to play on the global
14:01
stage when it comes to fending off
14:04
authoritarians you said Putin is a
14:06
madman and the United States has a role
14:08
to play and we're going to do our job we
14:12
start hearing that he is making sort of
14:14
similar comments to
14:17
lawmakers and this all I think comes to
14:20
a head at the end of last week and he
14:23
puts out a statement saying when
14:25
lawmakers return to Washington from
14:27
their Easter recet we are going to
14:30
consider aidid for
14:32
Ukraine and what explains why speaker
14:35
Johnson would suddenly want to fund
14:39
Ukraine and kick yet another Hornet's
14:42
Nest in the pantheon of things that the
14:44
far right does not like well part of it
14:48
is that Senate Democrats had already
14:51
called speaker Johnson's Bluff on this
14:54
issue so starting late last year he had
14:57
tried to put off off a vote on Ukraine
15:00
Aid in the house by saying that in order
15:03
to bring up the issue Democrats first
15:06
needed to agree to sweeping changes on
15:09
the border thinking probably the
15:11
Democrats would never agree to it
15:13
instead Senate Democrats went ahead and
15:15
actually negotiated a deal and speaker
15:18
Johnson rejected that package and Senate
15:21
Republicans followed his lead and voted
15:23
it down and so now when it comes to
15:25
Ukraine Democrats are looking at speaker
15:27
Johnson and saying okay you know we gave
15:29
you what you wanted what's your excuse
15:31
now for not letting this Aid come to a
15:33
vote right but I also think one of the
15:36
big things that's changed here for Mike
15:39
Johnson as speaker is that he is now
15:41
carrying this very heavy
15:44
responsibility he has talked to donors
15:47
about how shortly after being elected
15:49
speaker how he went to the situation
15:51
room and he received these briefings
15:54
from the president's cabinets on the
15:57
situation in Ukraine he is now meeting
16:00
with all of these leaders of NATO
16:03
countries and so part of the message
16:06
that he is hearing when he's in these
16:08
rooms with Biden officials NATO allies
16:12
is do you really want to be person who
16:15
is solely responsible for blocking this
16:18
aid from getting to keev that is a
16:22
really heavy message to internalize so
16:26
what we should understand to have
16:27
perhaps happened to Speaker Johnson when
16:29
it comes to
16:30
Ukraine is a little bit of the journey
16:33
he seems to have gone on when it comes
16:35
to these spending bills which is he has
16:40
come to terms with the true Stakes of
16:44
his job of what it means to not just be
16:47
a far-right member of the house but the
16:49
speaker of the entire institution and as
16:51
a result is ready to or seemingly ready
16:56
to make some pretty big IDI ological
17:00
leaps yeah I think that's exactly right
17:04
essentially as soon as he became speaker
17:06
he was met with these high stakes
17:09
occasions the first of which making sure
17:11
the government did not shut down now he
17:14
is being forced to confront this
17:15
question of whether to continue sending
17:18
Aid to Ukraine and his decision on that
17:21
putting some sort of Aid package to a
17:24
vote will probably be the most
17:26
politically risky move he's ever
17:29
made H why is that even riskier than the
17:32
spending bills for instance the issue of
17:35
sending a Ukraine has become such a
17:39
toxic issue for Republican voters it's a
17:43
deeply emotional issue to be honest with
17:45
you in a way that spending just is not
17:49
there's some component of I think among
17:52
Republican voters a sense of unfairness
17:54
right why are we sending this money to
17:56
another country instead of spending it
17:58
on our own citizens that really
18:00
resonates for people and Republican
18:02
lawmakers certainly are acutely aware of
18:05
this but as you've told us Johnson has
18:07
made it clear that he will take up this
18:10
money for Ukraine very soon so my
18:13
question is how does he do that in a way
18:16
that could possibly get through the
18:18
house without triggering a vote to aou
18:20
him or if it does trigger a vote to atin
18:23
which perhaps inevitably it would how
18:25
does he ensure that Democrats who want
18:28
this UK funding like this bill enough
18:32
that they will cross party lines and
18:34
save him well there's a whole men of
18:37
options being considered and it's my
18:39
understanding that the speaker himself
18:41
is not really circled around any one
18:44
particular option what Democrats would
18:46
love to see him do would be to just put
18:49
the senate pass Aid package on the floor
18:52
for a vote M but at the same time that
18:55
is exactly what Republicans would hate
18:58
to see him do and so we're now in this
19:01
realm where speaker Johnson is searching
19:04
for a path forward that is going to
19:07
incite the least amount of backlash from
19:10
his own conference but also hopefully
19:13
keep Democrats happy enough that they
19:15
potentially would still vote to save him
19:18
from an ouer if it came to that KY it
19:20
sounds like no matter what this Ukraine
19:22
funding package ultimately looks like
19:24
it's going to need a lot of democratic
19:26
house votes to pass and that these
19:29
far-right Republicans like margorie
19:30
Taylor green will be furious and this
19:32
could very well I have to imagine be the
19:33
moment that a la maker like her says
19:37
that's it we are done with Mike Johnson
19:39
and if she succeeds in trying to do that
19:42
I know the math is wonky but if she
19:43
succeeds I'm curious how Democrats are
19:46
going to ultimately make the decision of
19:49
whether to take the unprecedented step
19:52
of saving a republican house
19:54
Speaker well that would be quite the
19:57
scenario I think what it would look like
20:00
is a long series of probably quite
20:04
intense discussions among the Democratic
20:06
caucus where they would have to weigh do
20:09
we feel like Mike Johnson was an honest
20:11
broker here did he deliver for Ukraine
20:15
and look you know Michael A lot of them
20:17
have for weeks now individually been
20:20
floating the idea that they would vote
20:22
to save him if he did quote unquote the
20:25
right thing on Ukraine and so would have
20:29
to think that these promises would also
20:32
weigh pretty heavily over their
20:34
calculations because what is the point
20:37
of trying to get things done in a sort
20:39
of coalition government if you pull the
20:42
rug out under the leader at the last
20:45
moment there's a word you just use that
20:47
feels very important in thinking about
20:48
this moment Katie and it's the word
20:51
Coalition we tend to think of our
20:53
government especially the house as
20:54
deeply partisan Democrat Republican but
20:57
time and again over the past year year
21:00
and a half what we're seeing because the
21:03
chamber is so closely split is something
21:06
resembling coalition government in
21:09
foreign countries where these occasional
21:12
Cobble together groups that seem very
21:15
unexpected get things done and if that
21:19
were to happen with Ukraine especially
21:23
it starts to feel like we have something
21:25
resembling a somewhat functioning house
21:28
of representatives does that feel right
21:31
yeah I think so I mean you have to
21:33
remember again let's not give them too
21:35
much credit this is a very low bar that
21:37
we're talking about here you know we've
21:39
been calling it a governing Coalition
21:41
but it's really more of an emergency
21:43
system to keep everything from going off
21:45
the rails right this is making sure the
21:47
government is not shut down and
21:49
potentially a coalition emerging to
21:51
continue sending Aid to a democracy that
21:54
is fending off the advances of an
21:57
authoritarian that being said said I
21:58
think you are right to point out that
22:01
time and time again on these important
22:03
decisions the far right has essentially
22:06
box themselves out of discussions
22:09
because it's become very clear that they
22:10
will not support anything that really
22:13
could become law and it is a stark
22:17
departure from where they started the
22:19
beginning of the year I remember when it
22:21
became very clear that House Republicans
22:24
were going to have the majority but that
22:26
it was going to be a tiny majority a lot
22:28
of of these Freedom caucus members
22:30
crowing about the fact that this was
22:32
going to force the Republican speaker
22:34
into going into coalition government
22:37
with them it would force the Republican
22:39
speaker to bow to their preferences to
22:42
their
22:43
whims and instead what we've seen is the
22:46
opposite they have pushed the Republican
22:48
speaker whether it is Kevin McCarthy or
22:51
Mike Johnson into the arms of Democrats
22:54
and in the process kind of rendered
22:56
themselves powerless
22:59
right instead of holding their speaker
23:02
hostage instead of holding the entire
23:04
house hostage and really dictating the
23:06
terms of these big
23:08
debates they've become really less and
23:12
less relevant yeah I think the story of
23:16
this Congress is that when you have a
23:19
group like the far-right freedom caucus
23:21
who just says no to everything all the
23:24
time then you essentially deal yourself
23:28
out of the process at Key moments and
23:32
the end result of it has been that
23:34
everyone else in Congress has decided
23:36
the only way to move forward is to work
23:39
around
23:41
them well Katie thank you very much we
23:44
appreciate it thanks

Michael we'll be right

23:57
back
24:09
here's what else you need to know today
24:11
so I'm worried that there is a
24:13
significant mismatch in this case
24:17
between the claimed injury and the
24:21
remedy that's being sought during oral
24:24
arguments on Tuesday a majority of the
24:26
Supreme Court's justices appeared to
24:29
reject an effort by conservatives to
24:31
limit access to a widely used abortion
24:34
pill the case revolves around a lawsuit
24:38
brought by anti-abortion doctors and
24:40
groups who accused the FDA of unlawfully
24:44
expanding access to mistone which is
24:47
used in about 60% of
24:50
abortions but both conservative and
24:52
liberal justices including Justice
24:55
katoni Brown Jackson questioned whether
24:57
the small small group of doctors
24:59
challenging the FDA had suffered the
25:02
type of direct harm that would give them
25:04
the legal grounds to bring the case in
25:07
the first place they're saying because
25:09
we object to having to be forced to
25:12
participate in this procedure we're
25:14
seeking in order preventing anyone from
25:16
having access to these drugs at all and
25:20
I guess I'm just trying to understand
25:21
how they could possibly be entitled to
25:24
that given the injury that they have
25:27
alleged
25:28
and authorities are blaming the collapse
25:31
of a major bridge in Baltimore on a
25:34
cargo ship that had lost power moments
25:38
before it collided with the
25:40
structure the collapse of the Francis
25:43
Key Scott Bridge which occurred at
25:45
around 1:30 a.m. on Tuesday sent at
25:48
least eight construction workers into
25:51
the water below six of them are still
25:54
missing the ship's crew had issued a maj
25:58
day call shortly after losing power
26:01
giving officials a chance to stop cars
26:03
from crossing the bridge and likely
26:06
preventing an even greater
26:10
