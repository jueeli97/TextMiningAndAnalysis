The Alabama Ruling That Could Stop Families From Having Kids





0:01
from The New York Times I'm Michael
0:03
babbaro this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:11
daily today the story of how a surprise
0:15
ruling from the Alabama Supreme Court
0:17
halted fertility treatments across the
0:20
state and sent a shock wave through the
0:23
world of reproductive
0:25
health I spoke with my colleague azen
0:28
gishi about the court case itself and to
0:32
a patient in Alabama about what it's
0:35
like to navigate The
0:38
[Music]
0:40
[Applause]
0:44
Fallout it's Monday February
0:49
[Music]
0:55
26th Asing this Alabama ruling really
0:58
seemed to come almost out of nowhere for
1:00
a lot of us and in a world where we
1:02
frequently track court cases and we
1:05
expect them on a certain date this
1:07
didn't fall into that category it was a
1:09
genuine legal surprise so tell us the
1:13
story behind this case yeah so the
1:17
actual incident at the center of this
1:20
case happened in December 2020 at a
1:24
fertility clinic in Mobile Alabama
1:26
basically a person ended up wandering in
1:29
into the storage room of this Fertility
1:32
clinic which happened to be located in
1:33
the hospital they opened a tank where
1:38
Frozen embryos were stored pulled out a
1:41
vial and dropped them on the ground and
1:43
those embryos were destroyed wow these
1:45
Frozen embryos belonged to at least
1:48
three couples that we know of who were
1:50
undergoing IVF or inv vitro
1:53
fertilization to try to have a baby to
1:55
try to have a baby and so this is a
1:57
pretty unusual sounding situation we
1:59
don't know why a person was able to get
2:00
into this room why they stuck their hand
2:02
in a tank that was holding Frozen
2:04
embryos at 360Â° F but the couples in the
2:09
end filed suit against the fertility
2:11
clinic and the hospital in which the
2:13
fertility clinic was located and what
2:14
should we know about the lawsuit that
2:16
they filed so the lawsuit that they
2:17
filed I mean the most important thing to
2:18
know is that they ended up filing a
2:22
wrongful death claim this law in Alabama
2:25
the wrongful death of a minor law was
2:27
established in 1872 and they argu that
2:30
the loss of their embryos should fall
2:32
under that law H most people don't think
2:35
of an embryo in a fertility clinic
2:37
freezer as a baby or as a minor you
2:41
mentioned that law so what's the
2:43
argument made by these three couples for
2:46
why that should be the case so in one of
2:49
the couple's complaints they actually
2:52
described the embryos as quote
2:54
cryopreserved embryonic human beings
2:57
they argued that that storage room where
2:59
the tanks were being held should be
3:01
considered the same as a daycare
3:02
facility which you know daycare
3:04
facilities are protected under state
3:07
regulations and are required to be safe
3:09
secure and closely guarded and they said
3:11
you know small children including
3:13
embryos cannot protect themselves so
3:16
they were really making the argument
3:17
that the embryos that were destroyed in
3:21
this incident were essentially their
3:23
babies and had been killed I'm curious
3:26
what we know about the motives of these
3:28
plaintiffs for using this language
3:30
it feels like language we tend to
3:32
associate with social and religious
3:34
conservatives who have been trying to
3:37
redefine when life begins do we know if
3:41
the plaintiffs here are part of that
3:43
movement and do they share its goal I
3:46
mean the fact of the matter is we don't
3:48
know very much about these plaintiffs we
3:50
can't speak to their motivations I tried
3:53
to reach out to them and did not hear
3:55
back you know accidents happen in
3:57
fertility clinics often in those cases
4:00
patients are either settling with the
4:02
clinics outside of court or they're
4:04
bringing negligence cases to be
4:06
compensated for physical emotional
4:08
damages in this case we see a completely
4:11
different strategy we see these couples
4:13
bringing a wrongful death suit and
4:15
they're using very specific language of
4:18
personhood to make that argument and
4:21
obviously the personhood movement in the
4:22
United States has been seeking to Define
4:25
life as beginning at the very earliest
4:27
stages in an effort to to overturn the
4:30
right to abortion and that happened you
4:34
know in 2022 when we saw the fall of
4:36
roie Wade and once that ruling fell a
4:39
lot of people were wondering what does
4:41
this mean for IVF right Bing that
4:43
basically a case like this a case like
4:45
what these plaintiffs are arguing might
4:48
come along might gain subtraction yeah
4:50
it's The Logical conclusion to that
4:53
personhood argument okay so let's turn
4:55
to what happens to this lawsuit and how
4:57
we get to this very consequential ruling
5:01
so two lower trial courts in Alabama
5:03
actually rejected that wrongful deaths
5:05
argument they said that these embryos
5:07
should not be considered people that
5:10
brought this to Alabama Supreme Court
5:12
and they made the opposite ruling they
5:14
said that actually these embryos should
5:16
be considered children under Alabama
5:19
state law and how does the Alabama
5:21
Supreme Court explain why it came to
5:24
that conclusion so the main judge who
5:27
issued the opinion wrote that the text
5:29
of the wrongful death of a minor Act is
5:31
sweeping and unqualified it applies to
5:34
all children born and unborn without
5:36
limitation and we got even more insight
5:39
into the Court's thinking from some of
5:40
the concurring opinions one of the
5:42
justices wrote even before birth all
5:45
human beings have the image of God and
5:48
their lives cannot be destroyed without
5:50
effacing his glory so they're very much
5:53
taking the position that according to
5:55
the Bible these embryos should be
5:58
considered
6:00
human life right and according to
6:02
Alabama Law and according to Alabama Law
6:05
yes so what the justices of the Alabama
6:07
Supreme Court are saying in this ruling
6:09
just to be very clear is that a
6:12
fertilized embryo even outside a uterus
6:15
outside the womb is a full-fledged life
6:19
with all the legal protections of a baby
6:22
a minor and therefore they're resetting
6:25
the clock on the entire idea of when
6:29
life starts to its very earliest
6:32
conceivable moment so this is a narrow
6:36
ruling this applies to the three couples
6:38
in this case whose embryos were
6:41
destroyed but it sets a huge and quite
6:45
scary precedent for anyone who is
6:47
undergoing IVF anyone who works in the
6:50
fertility industry in Alabama who is
6:52
working with these embryos that are
6:53
suddenly considered children just
6:56
explain that accidents happen in
6:58
fertility clinics some sometimes an
7:00
embryo sticks to the side of the pipet
7:02
sometimes problems happen with shipping
7:05
sometimes a biopsy is taken for genetic
7:08
testing and it goes wrong I mean there
7:10
are many many ways that these embryos
7:13
can be damaged as a result of going
7:16
through this process and suddenly this
7:18
ruling just raises the stakes
7:20
tremendously and opens up a whole Suite
7:22
of new questions about how fertility
7:24
care can even be provided in the state
7:26
of Alabama right cuz suddenly everyone
7:28
involved in the chain of custody of an
7:32
embryo involved in IVF could very
7:35
logically worry that they could end up
7:37
being entangled in a wrongful death
7:39
lawsuit for something that based on what
7:40
you're saying might be just the routine
7:43
accidental end of an embryo's existence
7:46
yes okay so practically speaking on the
7:49
ground what end up being the
7:51
repercussions of that ruling in Alabama
7:55
pretty much immediately after this
7:57
ruling came out there was I would say
7:59
complete pandemonium you have fertility
8:02
clinics that are suddenly looking at
8:04
basically all their processes for how
8:05
they do things wondering what their
8:07
liability is going to be now that all of
8:10
these embryos could be considered
8:11
children under Alabama state law and
8:14
then there are the people who are
8:15
currently in the middle of undergoing
8:17
fertility treatment who don't know
8:20
whether they can proceed you know people
8:22
who had retrieval scheduled to retrieve
8:24
eggs from their body people who are
8:27
waiting to have embryos trans to see if
8:30
they will actually implant and so this
8:32
puts all fertility treatment in Alabama
8:35
into
8:37
limbo I think people just don't know
8:40
what's going to happen
8:46
[Music]
8:55
next last week not long after the
8:57
Alabama ruling we got an email from a
9:00
woman in
9:01
Birmingham her name is Megan Cole she
9:04
told us she's a 31-year-old lawyer and
9:06
that she's in the final stages of IVF
9:09
treatment on the day she wrote us last
9:12
Wednesday she said her embryos were
9:14
scheduled to be implanted in a surrogate
9:17
just 2 days
9:19
later so I called her and asked her to
9:21
tell us her
9:24
story why don't you just start just kind
9:27
of at the beginning about you know your
9:29
experience and what it's been like to
9:31
watch this thing come down and how you
9:34
kind of fit into this and and how it's
9:35
affecting what I understand from your
9:37
email to be like a pretty inprocess
9:40
situation yeah that you're in with your
9:43
with your
9:44
surrogate sure so back in high school I
9:47
was diagnosed with a super rare blood
9:50
disorder so between the disorder and the
9:55
medications that I'm on I can't safely
9:58
carry you know my my own
10:00
pregnancy wouldn't be safe for me
10:02
wouldn't be safe for the baby and you
10:04
know that was something that was
10:05
devastating and something that I had to
10:06
get over and realize okay like it is
10:10
what it is and maybe I'm just not meant
10:11
to you know have my own child and then I
10:15
learned about surrogacy and so that kind
10:16
of gave me hope which obviously that
10:20
entails going through
10:21
[Music]
10:25
IBS so last year
10:29
I went through two rounds of IVF and we
10:33
were finally matched with the surrogate
10:35
back in November and for two rounds of
10:38
IVF alone it cost us around 24,000 and
10:42
then you know when you add surrogacy on
10:44
top of that it's going to equal about
10:47
$250,000 Allin yep and we are currently
10:52
scheduled for an embryo transfer on
10:55
Friday and so you know last week we're
10:57
chugging along everything great and then
11:01
I get an email blast and read the
11:04
opinion and was shocked why were you
11:07
shocked just explain that I just didn't
11:10
think that this was even like an issue
11:13
or a thought I didn't think that Frozen
11:16
embryos would ever be considered like a
11:20
living child outside of a uterus I mean
11:23
they're frozen clusters of cells they
11:26
can't live outside of the freezer so I
11:29
just I didn't realize that someone would
11:31
rule this way and how quickly did it
11:34
become a question of your own
11:35
circumstance uh very
11:37
[Music]
11:41
quickly so after the shock kind of you
11:44
know settled in then I realized oh we
11:48
have a transfer schedule are the clinics
11:51
going to be kind of paralyzed because
11:54
they don't know what this ruling means
11:56
for them and are they gonna continue
11:58
with normal business so that was
12:02
obviously a concern and then today
12:05
actually the University of Alabama at
12:07
Birmingham UAB issued a note saying that
12:10
they're cusing all IVF so at that point
12:13
I really got
12:18
scared so we're talking to you like at
12:21
400 p.m. eastern time on Wednesday and
12:26
what exactly is the state of
12:28
communication you're having with the
12:29
clinic you know I know my clinic is
12:33
inundated with calls right now and so I
12:35
haven't been able to get in touch with
12:36
them to kind of see what the status is
12:40
but you know we're scheduled for Friday
12:43
and I'm just gonna assume that it's
12:46
going forward until I hear otherwise so
12:49
basically the biggest day of your life
12:51
is ambiguous at this moment like will
12:53
your pregnancy begin will I be having a
12:56
kid in nine months or will I not be
13:04
we've wanted a child for so long and and
13:07
now that we're almost
13:09
here you know and
13:12
and I'm sorry I don't want to like tear
13:15
up but to think
13:18
that a Supreme Court decision could now
13:21
take away my ability to fulfill my dream
13:24
of having a child my own child is like
13:27
really upsetting to me
13:28
[Music]
13:37
so talk a little bit about your
13:40
understanding of how this decision might
13:43
affect you and is there a universe where
13:45
it doesn't affect you right right I
13:48
think there is a situation where I'm not
13:50
affected I
13:51
mean it's not like the court said you
13:54
can't do IVF and you can't do any
13:57
transfers and and so I think there is a
14:00
universe and I think maybe I am
14:03
currently in that Universe where
14:05
everything does go forward on Friday but
14:08
yeah I'm in limbo right now and it's
14:10
really
14:20
scary well why don't we just keep
14:22
checking in with you and we can just
14:23
kind of keep keep trying to understand
14:26
where things stand okay that sounds good
14:28
thank thank you so much for calling okay
14:30
bye
14:31
[Music]
14:38
bye we'll be right
14:46
back so asine we just spoke with a woman
14:49
Meg who is in the Final Phase of the IVF
14:52
process with a surrogate her transfer
14:55
was scheduled for Friday February
14:59
23rd and when we spoke with her she said
15:01
the entire process is now uncertain she
15:04
has no idea if it's going to move
15:05
forward I'm curious how many people in
15:08
Alabama are in that kind of situation
15:11
now and what their options are if
15:14
they're involved in IVF in the state so
15:17
here's what we know there are at least
15:20
five IVF clinics in the state of Alabama
15:23
they performed at least 1,00 IVF
15:26
procedures in
15:27
2021 since the ruling came out pretty
15:30
much in Rapid succession we started
15:32
hearing from clinics that said they were
15:34
shutting down some or all of their ibf
15:36
procedures it started with the
15:38
University of Alabama Birmingham which
15:41
we should say by the way Meg when she
15:42
heard about that was really spooked yep
15:45
and then just yesterday we found out
15:47
that the Center for Reproductive
15:48
Medicine and mobile so that's the
15:50
fertility clinic at the center of this
15:51
suit is also shutting down operations
15:54
and a third Clinic has also announced
15:55
that as well so now there are three
15:57
major fertility clinics in Alabama
15:59
saying they aren't moving forward with
16:00
IVF treatments and they're basically
16:02
just shutting the whole thing down for
16:03
now they're shutting the whole thing
16:04
down and because they fear liability
16:06
because they fear liability because all
16:08
of a sudden these embryos that they are
16:09
handling could be considered people
16:12
under state law well so if you're
16:15
somebody trying to do IVF in Alabama you
16:18
have your fertilized eggs frozen in one
16:20
of these clinics that have paused their
16:23
work what can you do what should you do
16:26
I mean I think people are sort of
16:27
panicking and what wondering how they
16:29
can possibly move forward I mean one
16:31
option would be get your embryos out of
16:33
the state out ship them out ship them
16:36
out to another fertility clinic out of
16:37
state that can proceed with your
16:39
transfers but my colleague just reported
16:42
that one of the biggest embryo shipping
16:44
companies has just said that they too
16:46
don't want to accept the liability that
16:48
this new ruling imposes on them so in
16:50
case they were to be involved in
16:51
damaging in case something happens in
16:53
the process of shipping could they be
16:55
held liable under this interpretation of
16:57
the wrongful death Statute in Alabama so
17:00
everyone is spooked you know what could
17:02
this mean for their personal
17:03
responsibility in handling these embryos
17:06
so it feels safe to say that in
17:08
Alabama this ruling has pretty much
17:13
brought the entire IVF world or most of
17:16
it to a grinding Hall and I think the
17:20
question for people outside of Alabama
17:22
is what are the chances that a ruling
17:25
like the one that happened there could
17:28
happen
17:29
elsewhere in the country especially as
17:31
you explained earlier aine in a world
17:33
where there isn't roie Wade which had
17:36
been viewed as a kind of legal buffer
17:39
against efforts to go after something
17:43
like IVF so my colleague Sarah and I
17:46
actually spoke with a head of a
17:48
fertility clinic in Iowa who said I feel
17:51
for the patients and the fertility
17:52
providers in the state of Alabama I do
17:54
not think that this is going to be
17:56
limited to that state she's in a state
17:59
where there is a six- we abortion ban on
18:00
the books it's being challenged right
18:02
now but I think fertility providers
18:04
across the country are worried about
18:05
what this could possibly mean for them
18:07
in states that have made it clear that
18:09
they want to ban abortion there is of
18:11
course an irony here which is that we
18:15
think of the personhood debate as
18:17
primarily being around abortion and
18:20
ending pregnancies IVF is about creating
18:25
pregnancy it's about creating life
18:27
babies so it would seem like something
18:29
that social and religious conservatives
18:32
would Embrace not try to restrict yeah I
18:35
mean what you just described as the
18:37
split that we're currently seeing play
18:39
out in the Republican Party many
18:41
Republicans are saying that they oppose
18:43
this decision they're trying to distance
18:45
themselves from it I mean you have Mike
18:47
Pence who went through IVF with his wife
18:49
has been outspoken about it saying that
18:51
you know IVF needs to be protected um my
18:53
Pence being a very prominent social
18:55
conservative yes we have legislators
18:57
even in the state of Alabama saying that
18:59
IVF needs to be protected in that state
19:01
and you know they know that most
19:03
Americans including Republicans support
19:05
IVF for the reason that you said it's
19:08
helping people start families but the
19:10
reality is that the extreme elements of
19:13
the anti-abortion movement in this
19:14
country are ecstatic about this ruling
19:18
the alliance defending Freedom has said
19:20
that this is a tremendous victory for
19:22
life this really supports the arguments
19:24
that they have been pushing for decades
19:26
to try to ban abortion so that is a
19:28
tension that's playing out in the
19:30
conservative world it's really unclear
19:33
as of now whether IVF will become the
19:35
same kind of battleground in this
19:37
country that abortion has become we have
19:39
good reason to think that it won't
19:41
because of the popularity of I but what
19:44
we do know is that that extreme point of
19:47
view has prevailed in Alabama and that
19:51
has very real consequences for fertility
19:53
patients in that
19:55
state azen thank you very much
19:58
thanks
20:07
Michael hey this is Megan hey Megan it's
20:10
Michael Barbaro how are you hey how are
20:12
you I'm
20:14
good so as promised we wanted to check
20:17
back in with you yes and it's now Friday
20:22
afternoon this was the day that your
20:25
transfer was scheduled to happen so I
20:28
wonder if you can just catch us up on
20:30
what's happened since we last spoke with
20:32
you a couple days ago sure um so later
20:36
on that night like at 7 o'clock I got a
20:39
response but it was kind of like a
20:41
lawyer response and a very much of we
20:44
don't really know yet what's going on
20:46
you know uh we'll be in touch as we
20:48
figure things out so after I got that I
20:51
just sent an email directly to my doctor
20:54
and I said you know you got to shoot me
20:56
straight what's going on on is the
20:59
transfer going forward and then about 20
21:02
minutes after I sent that email I saw my
21:05
Clinic's number pop up on my phone and
21:08
instantly knew that it was going to be
21:09
bad news um and and our doctor said I'm
21:12
so sorry but you know it's it has to be
21:15
cancelled I instantly broke down in
21:18
tears um I don't think I've ever cried
21:21
that hard in my life my husband is very
21:26
outgoing and very talkative and talk to
21:28
anyone and he was basically silent you
21:31
know for 20 30 minutes he just didn't
21:33
know what to say and was trying to
21:34
process this decision and the
21:37
cancellation of the transfer that we've
21:39
been waiting for for over a year and
21:42
then you know I called our surrogate and
21:45
had to break the news to her um the
21:47
person who's been taking hormone
21:49
medications for the last three weeks and
21:51
dealing with that while also dealing you
21:53
know with her own family and had to
21:55
break that news and she was obviously
21:57
devastated as well
21:59
after you processed this after you got
22:00
off the phone with the surrogate what
22:03
was going through your
22:06
head it
22:08
was how are we going to make this happen
22:11
how are we going to get these embryos
22:13
out of this state and have our transfer
22:16
move
22:19
[Music]
22:20
forward but as of now we are unable to
22:25
move our embryos out of the state
22:28
because the clinics are worried that
22:30
there might be destruction of an embryo
22:33
um you know obviously through the
22:34
process of transporting them out of
22:37
state and that could open them up to
22:39
liability it could open us up to
22:41
liability um so that was not an option
22:44
either so your clinic is saying you
22:47
can't use your embryos because of this
22:49
ruling and it's also saying because of
22:51
this ruling you can't move your embryos
22:53
it's basically for now shutting down
22:57
your off options to conceive a child I
23:00
mean the only option would be for me to
23:03
go through an IVF cycle out of state my
23:07
third IVF cycle get those embryos Frozen
23:11
genetically tested again the whole
23:13
process I mean redo the whole process
23:15
which would cost us another
23:17
$30,000 and that wouldn't be something
23:19
that we would be able to do immediately
23:21
I mean that would take at least another
23:23
year right which every every when you're
23:26
in this process every day seems like a
23:28
year we've been waiting and waiting to
23:32
have a child and we were on the cusp and
23:34
so the thought of having to wait you
23:36
know another year or even another six
23:38
months is is really hard for
23:42
[Music]
23:47
us how did you end up spending this day
23:51
Friday the day where you thought that
23:55
you were going to begin a journey toward
23:57
WS having a child and
23:59
instead you didn't because of this
24:02
ruling I mean I spoke with my mom my my
24:04
dad and my sister all today um one thing
24:07
that my sister said you know is she's
24:10
been angry as well and she said it feels
24:12
like a death in the family like we were
24:14
all excited to have the possibility that
24:18
a child would be coming into our family
24:21
and she said you know it feels like a
24:23
death do you feel that
24:26
way I do in the sense of it feels like a
24:31
death of our Dream to become
24:34
parents you know we were almost there
24:38
and so now that dream has it seems less
24:41
obtainable at this
24:45
moment well Megan thank you
24:48
for sharing all this with us of course
24:52
in our first conversation and now in
24:53
this second one and I I wish you and
24:56
your husband the very best Y no problem
24:59
thank
25:01
[Music]
25:14
you over the weekend both Democratic and
25:17
Republican lawmakers in Alabama
25:19
including its conservative Governor K
25:22
Ivy said they would consider legislation
25:25
to protect IVF treatments from the
25:28
Court's
25:29
ruling but so far it's unclear when such
25:33
legislation would be voted on and
25:35
whether there's enough support for it to
25:39
[Music]
25:48
pass we'll be right
25:51
[Music]
25:56
back
26:11
here's what else you need to another day
26:13
I was just informed that we got double
26:16
the number of votes that has ever been
26:19
received in the great state of South
26:22
Carolina so that's pretty good so it's a
26:25
record time in his latest victory in the
26:28
Republican primary Donald Trump soundly
26:31
defeated Nikki Haley his only remaining
26:34
opponent in her home state of South
26:36
Carolina by 20 percentage points the
26:40
outcome Haley's fourth straight defeat
26:43
to Trump solidified Trump's status as
26:46
the party's de facto nominee like this
26:49
and I just want to say that I have never
26:51
seen the Republican party so unified as
26:55
it is right now never been like
26:59
this and a Manhattan Jury has found that
27:03
the leaders of the NRA the country's
27:06
most powerful gun rights group engaged
27:09
in a yearslong pattern of financial
27:12
misconduct and Corruption the verdict
27:15
amounted to a public rebuke of the
27:18
organization's longtime CEO Wayne laier
27:21
who resigned from the NRA last month
27:24
during the trial it was revealed that
27:26
laier had used NRA funds to pay for
27:30
millions of dollars in personal expenses
27:33
including high-end clothing yacht rides
27:36
and luxury flights for himself and his
