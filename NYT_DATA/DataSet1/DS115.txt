The 1948 Economic Moment That Might Explain Our Own



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Michael babo
0:04
this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:09
daily on Friday show we explored
0:13
President Biden's political challenge
0:15
with a core group of supporters black
0:17
voters today his challenge with voters
0:21
motivated by the economy at a time when
0:24
it looks good on paper but still feels
0:28
bad for so many Americans
0:30
my colleague Nate Co says that to
0:34
understand the situation it helps to
0:36
look back at another election 76 years
0:44
ago it's Monday February
0:48
[Music]
0:54
5th Nate we just got the latest batch of
0:57
economic news on Friday which showed a
0:59
surge in hiring a very strong us labor
1:02
market and it really highlighted this
1:05
conundrum we've talked about a lot on
1:08
the show which is that we're living in a
1:10
pretty healthy economy and yet voters
1:12
are still quite sour on the economy and
1:15
now that we've entered this general
1:17
election phase of the presidential
1:19
campaign that Dynamic looms as a pretty
1:23
major question mark over the entire race
1:26
because it doesn't feel like we have a
1:27
precedent for it does this sentiment
1:31
help Trump does it help Biden but you
1:34
say Nate we actually do have a precedent
1:38
for this this weird economy in an
1:41
election year it has happened before so
1:45
just
1:46
explain yes it has but I've been
1:48
searching for a long time to find a
1:51
economic and political moment that
1:52
resembles the economy we have today and
1:55
that's been really hard because you know
1:57
in the era of modern consumer confidence
2:00
data there just isn't an economy like
2:02
this one there isn't an economy that has
2:05
this weird combination of low
2:08
unemployment High economic growth and a
2:11
dissatisfied electorate but I wound up
2:15
digging just a little bit further back
2:17
just before the era of modern consumer
2:21
confidence data and I did find an
2:23
economic moment that actually bore a lot
2:26
of resemblance to the economy today and
2:30
it also had very similar political
2:34
characteristics to what we see today
2:35
with a dissatisfied country under
2:37
circumstances that look a lot like what
2:39
we've seen since the pandemic and it
2:42
happened to be an election year and a
2:43
very famous election year at that okay
2:45
first of all congratulations that seems
2:47
like a really big find thank you what is
2:51
the year the year is
The PostWar Economy
2:54
1948 so postwar but just barely just
2:58
barely and and like the post-pandemic
3:01
economy the postwar economy after World
3:04
War II was really weird
3:07
H Housewives shopping for their holiday
3:09
dinners found food prices 40% higher
3:12
than 18 months ago the end of wartime
3:16
rationing LED all of these consumers to
3:19
immediately start buying goods again and
3:22
led inflation to Skyrocket trying to
3:24
replenish their wardrobes Americans
3:26
found clothing up 19% you know at the
3:29
same time all these troops had come home
3:31
from overseas and they were looking for
3:33
housing and there was a housing shortage
3:35
against the twin handicaps of spiraling
3:37
costs and material shortages there is no
3:39
veteran problem more pressing than
3:41
housing and a lot of that is like what
3:43
we see today obviously the housing
3:44
market is really tight right now and
3:47
more generally this is the only moment
3:49
in the era of modern economic data when
3:51
a president oversaw an economy with
3:54
inflation over 7% while unemployment
3:57
stayed under 4% and and the economy kept
4:00
growing like it did today there's no
4:03
other example like
4:04
[Music]
The Publics Dissatisfaction
4:12
it so on paper in 1948 and
4:16
20024 have just a tremendous amount of
4:19
economic similarity yeah and I think
4:22
that one thing that I think is charming
4:24
about the example is that the source of
4:27
this weird set of economic conditions
4:28
was sort of fundamental similar both the
4:31
end of the pandemic and the end of the
4:33
war economy brought these
4:35
disruptions that led to the distortions
4:38
in prices led to the distortions in the
4:40
housing market and left Americans
4:42
feeling strangely dissatisfied even
4:45
though by other measures like
4:46
unemployment or growth things look
4:47
pretty goodh you know and at the time
4:50
Harry Truman was President he was a
4:52
Democrat he took over after the death of
4:55
FDR in
4:56
1945 and in large part because of prices
4:59
in the economy Harry Truman's popularity
5:02
collapsed he started out with a 90%
5:04
approval rating after World War II but
5:07
by the early part of his election year
5:08
in 1948 his approval rating was all the
5:11
way down to
5:12
36% wow not unlike correct me if I'm
5:16
wrong you're the polling expert
5:17
President Biden today that's right it's
5:20
very similar Joe Biden's approval rating
5:22
right now is in the upper 30s so that's
5:24
right next to where Harry Truman was at
5:26
the time any know it's worth dwelling on
5:29
just
5:30
remarkable The public's dissatisfaction
5:32
with the economy was I mean we think of
5:34
the postwar era as being the dawn of
5:36
this really prosperous time for
5:37
Americans which in retrospect it
5:39
certainly was but Americans were so
5:42
pessimistic about the economy they
5:44
thought a depression was likely and More
5:46
than
5:47
70% of Americans said they wanted their
5:49
own wages to go down if that's what it
5:51
would take in order to bring down prices
5:53
wow okay so weird postwar economy highly
5:57
dissatisfied public and you mention
5:59
mentioned this was an election year so
6:01
Truman politically speaking is in real
6:04
trouble yeah deep trouble the Democratic
6:07
Coalition is falling apart he's seing
6:09
his way in over his head and you take
6:12
one high-profile example the new
6:14
Republic then a very prominent liberal
6:16
magazine you know argued that he should
6:18
just leave the race alt together and not
6:20
even run for reelection but of course he
6:22
doesn't leave the race he's left facing
6:24
an opponent in Republican Thomas dwey
6:26
who he seems very likely to lose to he's
6:29
trailing in the polls he's in a lot of
6:31
trouble heading right up to the election
6:33
so amid this toxic economic feeling
6:37
moment that seems so lethal for Truman
6:39
what happens well things start to turn
A Big Comeback
6:42
around the economy stages a big comeback
6:45
inflation plummets inflation's at 10% in
6:48
January 1948 and it falls in half by
6:52
October and voters perceived that they
6:55
reported to pollsters that they expected
6:57
prices to rise when it was the summer
6:59
and by the time the election came around
7:00
they weren't expecting additional price
7:03
increases and with that economic
7:05
backdrop Truman runs one of the most
7:07
famous campaigns in American political
7:09
history let's take a look at the record
7:12
of the 80th Congress though so proud of
7:15
I call it the notorious do nothing
7:17
Republican 80th Congress you may
7:20
remember from your US history class that
7:22
he runs against the do nothing congress
7:25
the thing that Congress wasn't doing was
7:26
taking action to control prices that's
7:28
the true story of why prices are so high
7:32
so he runs a populist campaign to try
7:34
and argue that the Republicans aren't
7:36
standing up for working people and
7:39
despite all of that Truman still trails
7:42
in the polls to his rival the Republican
7:44
Thomas Dey all the way up until the end
7:46
Governor Thomas E Dey proclaimed as the
7:49
overwhelming favorite records his own
7:51
vote with calm confidence the
7:53
expectation that dwey is going to win is
7:55
so strong that there are even newspapers
7:57
printed before the election is over that
7:59
say Dewey defeats Truman but in the end
8:03
through the day and far into the night
8:04
the results come in state by state until
8:07
the news that confounded the experts and
8:08
the prophets Truman win Harry Truman
8:11
wins in what's arguably the most famous
8:13
comeback in American political
8:15
[Music]
Biden on the Truman Path
8:17
history so how much is President Biden
8:20
on this kind of a Truman economic
8:23
Improvement political Fortune Revival
8:26
path or not economically I think there's
8:30
a really good case that Biden is on the
8:33
Truman path or even ahead of schedule
8:35
inflation has been steadily declining
8:37
already over the last year you know as I
8:39
just mentioned a moment ago inflation
8:41
was still at 10% in January 1948 and
8:44
inflation today is already down under 4%
8:47
and may still be expected to fall
8:49
heading into the election and there are
8:52
already signs that voters are beginning
8:54
to respond to the positive economic news
8:56
we just got new consumer confidence data
8:59
over the last few days and it shows that
9:01
consumer sentiment has risen to the
9:03
highest level since 2021 which is of
9:05
course the year that post pandemic
9:07
inflation really began to set in and it
9:09
also happens to be the last time Joe
9:11
Biden's approval rating was over 50% and
9:14
importantly Americans expect that
9:17
inflation is going to continue to
9:18
decline so there's this sort of sense
9:20
that maybe we've gotten through the
9:22
toughest part here in brighter days are
9:23
ahead and these gains in consumer
9:26
sentiment are broad it's up across every
9:28
age group group every income group and
9:30
every educational group so those are
9:32
very positive signs for Joe Biden if he
9:35
wanted to try and pull off something
9:37
like what Harry Truman was able to pull
9:38
off in 48 so this very much does seem to
9:42
be a largely analogous trajectory
9:46
economically speaking 1948
9:49
2024 Democrat Harry Truman Democrat Joe
9:53
Biden yeah absolutely I mean that
9:55
doesn't mean they're the exact same
9:56
election there are all kinds of
9:58
differences Truman had to overcome
10:00
challenges that Biden won't have to
10:01
overcome Biden will have to overcome
10:03
challenges that Harry Truman didn't have
10:05
to overcome and one of the biggest
10:07
differences here is that Joe Biden owns
10:09
the blame for inflation in a way Harry
10:11
Truman didn't why not well you know as I
10:13
mentioned Harry Truman was able to blame
10:15
Congress he said he had the solution to
10:18
inflation in a way that Joe Biden simply
10:20
can't say
10:22
today but one of the biggest differences
10:25
and what may prevent history from
10:27
repeating itself today is that
10:29
the economy just is not nearly as
10:32
powerful as it once was in shaping
10:35
electoral
10:36
outcomes and so even if Biden is able to
10:40
replicate Truman's exact same economic
10:42
Fortune it may not be enough for him to
10:45
win
10:45
[Music]
10:57
re-election well we'll be right
The Economy in the 2020 Election
11:06
back n you just said that a major
11:08
difference between 1948 and now
11:12
2024 and whether or not Biden is or is
11:15
not Truman in this election has a lot to
11:18
do with the economy and you suggested
11:21
that it's not as powerful of force in
11:24
elections as it had been in the past and
11:27
that's surprising I mean every thing we
11:29
have been told as political journalists
11:32
and As Americans is that it's the
11:34
economy stupid right the economy is
11:37
decisive in elections so you're just
11:38
going to have to explain yourself well
11:40
the economy is absolutely a huge factor
11:43
in shaping our elections still but it's
11:46
not the only thing that matters and over
11:49
time there have been more and more signs
11:52
that the economy has become a little
11:54
less important in shaping the outcome of
11:56
our elections and what are those signs
11:59
well one easy sign that I think we can
12:01
all see in our everyday lives is the
12:03
approval ratings of our presidents take
12:05
Donald Trump Donald Trump presided over
12:07
an excellent economy an economy that
12:10
apparently is so good that many voters
12:12
are yearning for it again
12:14
today but his approval ratings were
12:16
never over 50% there's nothing like that
12:19
in the longer term historic record right
12:22
that's something that's very different
12:23
that we see today that we haven't seen
12:25
in the past and it's a sign that there
12:28
are other things that are shaping
12:31
political opinions about the president
12:33
that just didn't exist decades ago now
12:36
some of that could be about the
12:37
specifics of Donald Trump or Joe Biden
12:39
or Barack Obama but when it happens now
12:42
for three straight presidents that's
12:44
when you start to wonder whether it's
12:45
not really about anything about them but
12:47
something deeper happening in American
12:50
politics I just want to be clear so over
12:52
the last three
12:54
presidencies Biden Trump Obama you're
12:58
seeing more and more of a disconnect
13:01
between the health of the economy and
13:04
the president's approval ratings which
13:06
used to be a lot more of a kind of on
13:09
toone relationship economy was good
13:11
approval ratings good economy was bad
13:13
approval ratings bad you're saying that
13:15
relationship has kind of ruptured a
13:16
little bit it's not just ruptured it's
13:19
almost gone over the last three
13:21
presidents well why is that I mean what
The Economic Relationship to Presidential Approval Ratings
13:24
explains why this economic relationship
13:27
to presidential approval ratings is
13:31
evaporating well in a certain sense the
13:33
answer is obvious you know it's that we
13:35
live in a more polarized country that's
13:37
deeply divided on a pretty long set of
13:40
ideologically charged issues that voters
13:42
care a lot about going back to the
13:44
example about Donald Trump I don't think
13:47
that our listeners should have any
13:48
difficulty imagining all of the reasons
13:50
why voters disapproved of Donald Trump
13:53
even though the economy was good there
13:55
were his views on immigration there was
13:59
his conduct in office there's also just
14:02
the general backdrop of deeply polarized
14:04
country where there are far fewer
14:06
persuadable voters there are things like
14:09
this for Joe Biden as well there are
14:11
voters who have a lot of skepticism
14:13
about his age there are people who are
14:15
concerned about his stance on Israel
14:17
there are people who are concerned about
14:19
immigration and the Border there's a lot
14:21
of different reasons why voters can
14:24
disapprove of Joe Biden even though they
14:26
think that the economy is pretty decent
14:29
and indeed in 1948 for what it's worth
14:31
Harry Truman had a lot of issues like
14:32
this Civil Rights was becoming an issue
14:35
in 1948 the first Israeli Arab war and
14:39
Israel's existence was also in 1948 but
14:41
the number of Voters who care about
14:43
these issues and now vote on them is
14:45
much higher than it used to be H in a
14:48
polarized America where perhaps a more
14:51
and more nationalized and partisan media
14:54
exists what you're describing is an
14:56
environment in which non economic issues
14:59
become more Central to people's identity
15:02
more Central to how they vote yeah and
15:05
you know it's worth thinking about a
15:07
sociological element here too which is
15:08
that Americans are much more affluent
15:12
and highly educated than they were in
15:14
1948 back in 1948 fewer than 10% of
15:17
Americans had graduated college and most
15:20
people didn't have deeply informed views
15:23
on these kind of Arcane social issues
15:26
they might have had some view but it
15:28
wasn't nearly as important to them as
15:30
getting their weekly paycheck and
15:32
providing a basic standard of living for
15:34
their families and today in 2024 more
15:38
than 40% of Voters will come from
15:40
households making more than $100,000 a
15:42
year this combination of material
15:44
affluence and high
15:47
education creates a set of conditions
15:49
where voters have the privilege as
15:51
people like to say the luxury right the
15:53
luxury of voting on non-economic issues
15:57
and the
15:59
knowledge of the issues that would allow
16:00
them to care about them to treat
16:02
politics like a sport and to Value these
16:05
kind of ideological questions more than
16:08
they would have in the past okay so who
The Luxury of Voting
16:11
in
16:12
2024 given everything you just explained
16:15
does the economy matter to most well
16:20
everyone cares about the economy a
16:21
little bit right but not everyone has
16:24
the luxury to care about other issues
16:27
and not everyone
16:29
has deeply well-informed views of those
16:32
other issues like abortion or the border
16:34
and so on and the people who care about
16:36
the economy but don't have the same kind
16:39
of ideological politics tend to be
16:42
working class it's not that there's no
16:44
one who's workingclass that cares about
16:46
these things of course and it's not that
16:47
everyone who's highly educated and Rich
16:51
cares about abortion but you're much
16:54
more likely to be persuadable on the
16:56
economy if you have lower educational
16:58
attainment and you have lower levels of
17:01
income okay so you're saying unlike
Trump Voters
17:04
presumably 1948 today there are just
17:06
fewer voters who are persuadable based
17:08
on economic issues alone or primarily
17:11
and the ones who are tend to be lower
17:14
income and have lower education levels
17:18
so I guess the question is are those
17:20
voters even really available to
17:23
President Biden because we tend to think
17:25
of them as Trump voters is that
17:28
understanding correct yeah that's
17:30
absolutely right I mean Donald Trump's
17:32
political strength is among working
17:34
class voters and then on the economic
17:37
issue in particular he's always had an
17:39
advantage over Joe Biden on who would
17:41
handle the economy best and you know we
17:44
haven't said this explicitly but it's
17:45
worth noting that there are a lot of
17:47
polls showing Joe Biden really weak
17:49
among low-income voters and that
17:52
shouldn't be too much of a surprise
17:53
given his poor economic ratings and the
17:55
basic theory of modern politics that
17:58
I've outlined to you but Democrats
18:00
usually do best among low-income voters
18:03
so if the economy turns around you're
18:05
hoping if you're Joe Biden that you
18:07
start to do better among those lowincome
18:09
traditionally Democratic voters the sort
18:11
of people who voted for Harry Truman in
18:13
1948 who are voting for the Democrats
18:15
because they thought the Democrats were
18:16
the party of the working class and were
18:18
good for their material interests got it
18:21
so you're saying yes these voters have
18:23
tended to vote for Trump in the past but
18:25
that's not set in stone they are
18:27
potentially persuadable and in fact an
18:30
improving economy could bring them into
18:32
Joe Biden's Camp that's right an
18:34
improving economy could change the math
18:36
here the risk for Donald Trump is pretty
18:38
serious if the economy becomes less
18:41
important to voters then his biggest
18:42
Advantage goes away among the group he
18:45
usually counts on in order to win
18:47
elections Donald Trump's going to win
18:49
voters without a college degree no
18:51
matter what happens right I'm not saying
18:52
that Joe Biden's going to go and win the
18:54
white working class or something like
18:55
that but whether Donald Trump can
18:58
generate huge margins among that group
19:00
whether he can keep gaining among that
19:01
group that's what keeps him in the game
19:03
that's what gives him a chance to win
19:05
the election what I think is interesting
19:07
is we're seeing an awareness already
19:10
from Trump that this is a problem for
19:12
him you know the other day he said
19:14
something about how some of the recent
19:16
gains in the stock market we've seen can
19:17
actually be attributed to the polls
19:20
showing him in the lead that's the sort
19:23
of thing you say when you know the
19:25
economy is really important to you and
19:27
you want make sure that if it is
19:29
improving Joe Biden doesn't get credit
19:31
for it right I think what he said
Trump Stock Market
19:33
specifically was that the rising stock
19:35
market was a trump stock market because
19:38
it was a stock market reacting to the
19:39
assumption that he would win which felt
19:41
like a little bit of a stretch but what
19:43
you're saying is that is a sign that
19:45
Trump recognizes that a kind of rising
19:49
economic Fortune for Biden is bad for
19:53
him and he needs to come up with some
19:55
sort of plan to do something about it
19:57
and that's a struggle yeah I mean it's
19:59
almost better than any consumer
20:00
sentiment PLL that we've got right I
20:02
mean if Donald Trump knows that he can't
20:03
pretend like the economy is bad that
20:05
says something about how credible he
20:06
thinks that side of the argument is
The Scale of Voters
20:09
fascinating so really just to return to
20:11
our 1948 example for a moment the
20:13
difference with today is the scale of
20:16
Voters who may be persuaded based on
20:18
economic conditions in 1948 a whole lot
20:21
of Voters felt much happier by the time
20:24
the election rolled around and so that
20:27
may well have convinced
20:28
a lot of them to reelect Harry Truman
20:30
and sway the election in his favor today
20:32
that number of people who can be
20:34
persuaded by the economy alone is a lot
20:36
smaller as you've explained but both
20:38
candidates would still love to have
20:40
their support especially in a close race
20:42
which we expect to have so what we're
20:44
likely to see now if the economy keeps
20:47
improving is a pretty robust fight and I
20:51
guess we're already starting to see it
20:52
over who should get the credit for it
20:55
Biden or Trump yeah I think we could see
Biden or Trump
20:59
something like that but look Biden is
21:01
likely going to get the credit for an
21:03
improving economy not Trump Biden's the
21:05
president Trump can try and spin the
21:07
stock market all day but that's going to
21:10
be a tough sell for the American people
21:12
I think that if you're Biden if the
21:15
economy continues to improve that's
21:17
probably going to help him to some
21:19
extent or another it could even be the
21:22
foundation for his
Conclusion
21:25
re-election but remember we're talking
21:27
about a persu able group of Voters not
21:29
single isue voters we can't assume that
21:31
just because the economy improves it
21:33
means Biden's going to win there are
21:35
other issues that can sway these voters
21:37
the Border Biden's age the war in Israel
21:40
or something else it's not so simple as
21:43
to say that their vote will be dictated
21:46
exclusively by the economy but I think
21:48
it's fair to say that with all of the
21:50
huge issues that Loom over the country
21:52
today and how polarized our country is
21:55
that an improving economy may not be the
21:58
the same kind of wind in Joe Biden's
22:00
sales that it was for Harry Truman in
22:04

1948 well Nate thank you very much for

Credits
22:29
here's what else you need to know day
22:32
over the weekend the United States and
22:34
its allies carried out a barrage of
22:36
attacks on Iranian forces and the
22:39
militias they support the strikes began
22:42
on Friday targeting sites in Syria and
22:45
Iraq in response to attacks that killed
22:48
three American soldiers in Jordan and
22:51
injured at least 40 more US troops the
22:55
attacks continued on Saturday and Sunday
22:58
with us strikes against dozens of
23:00
Targets in Yemen controlled by the
23:03
Iranian backed houthi militia which has
23:06
continued to threaten global Shipping in
23:08
the Red Sea while the United States says
23:11
that it is not looking to widen the war
23:14
in the Middle East the strikes over the
23:16
past 3 days represent a clear escalation
23:20
that American officials said was far
23:23
from over so I don't have anything to
23:25
share with you today un precisely
23:28
who was taken out in those strikes but I
23:30
would just say that the president was
23:32
clear when he ordered them and when he
23:35
conducted them that that was the
23:36
beginning of our response and there will
23:37
be more steps to
23:42
come and in the first Democratic
23:45
presidential primary President Biden
23:48
thoroughly dominated his rivals in South
23:51
Carolina winning more than 96% of the
23:54
vote Biden's campaign team was AAL
23:57
especially interested in the turnout of
23:59
black voters who poll show are less
24:02
enthusiastic about him than in the past
24:05
Biden's AIDS said that early data from
24:08
Saturday's primary showed that the share
24:11
of black voters in South Carolina was
24:14
133% higher than in
