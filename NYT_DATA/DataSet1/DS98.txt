The Voters Willing to Abandon Biden Over Gaza


0:01
okay Salam alikum everyone my name is Mona Mai and I think it's so inspiring
0:06
that we have uh people from so many different professions and Paths of life and ethnicities joining us here today to
0:13
do the phone banking we really want to send a strong message using our voting
0:18
power to let Biden know that we strongly reject his aiding and abetting and
0:24
funding of the genocide and War in Gazza from the New York times I'm
0:31
Sabrina Tavern and this is the daily this is abdan hammed I'm calling from Michigan hi this is Ian with the
0:37
Michigan uncommitted campaign and we want to cease fire in Gaza now is this Hussein in the past few weeks activists
0:43
in Michigan began calling voters in the state asking them to protest President
0:49
Biden's support for Israel by not voting for him in the Democratic primary are you planning to vote in the Democratic
0:56
primary because we are asking folks to vote uncommitted Michigan has one of the largest Arab American populations in the
1:03
country and the activists are trying to turn its anger over Gaza into a
1:09
political force Biden is not listening to us so this is the right time to give him message before the general election
1:15
okay one that could be decisive in this critical swing state where winning in
1:21
November will likely be a matter of the slimmest of margins you are going to be voting uncommitted okay amazing I'm so
1:27
happy we are on the same page free Palestine that's right great and could you ask three of your friends to do that
1:33
as well yeah today my colleague Jennifer Medina on how Israel's war in Gaza is
1:40
changing politics in Michigan it's Tuesday February
1:48
27th so Jenny the Democratic Primary in Michigan is today and it's an election
1:53
that typically wouldn't matter very much right I mean Joe Biden of course is the incumbent and he's already pretty much
1:59
sealed the deal to be the nominee so why are you covering it yes it's true that a
2:05
primary with an incumbent president is typically pretty unimportant and there's normally a low turnout and even in this
2:12
primary Joe Biden is absolutely expected to win and so there's a little surprise
2:17
most of the time but this year we have this whole new wild factor and that's
2:22
the war in Gaza and the war has created enormous anger in a state like Michigan
2:28
where there are tens of thousands of Voters potentially looking for a way to voice their anger in the primary
2:35
election so enormous anger at the war in Gaza in a state like Michigan so tell me
2:40
about that what is it about Michigan so Michigan is this interesting State first of all it's been a swing state for a
2:47
very long time but also in the context of the war in Gaza it's really interesting because of the
2:53
demographics Michigan has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country we're talking something in the
2:59
ballpark of 200,000 Arab Americans and that's a group of people who have been angry with us policy toward Israel for
3:07
decades but because of the war in Gaza it's something totally different it's bringing anger to the four like never
3:14
before yeah and it's not just Arab Americans who are angry right it's become a central issue for Democrats on
3:20
the left as the war in Gaza has raged on and the death toll has risen we've seen
3:26
more and more people speak out against Biden for supporting Israel and they've
3:31
begun to threaten to withhold their vote for him because of that support and we've seen this Coalition led by Arab
3:39
American voters in Detroit begin to concentrate their anger on the Michigan primary and they're asking a few
3:45
different things some organizers are telling voters that they should check an uncommitted box on the primary ballot
3:51
essentially saying none of the above and other people urge voters to write in free Palestine or free Gaza and there's
3:59
lots of different ways they could protest but there's a group that really coalesces around this idea of
4:05
uncommitted and the bottom line for them is they want to send a message to Biden
4:10
saying if he doesn't change policy he will have a real problem on his hands
4:16
for the election in November right okay so speaking of November let's play this out here let's say nothing changes after
4:22
the primary what happens if these same voters don't support Biden in the general election in November I think 's
4:29
no question it would be a huge problem for Biden arab-americans are a group of
4:35
Voters that have largely supported Democrats in the past and it's pretty unlikely that a majority of them would
4:41
move to Trump but more realistically it's definitely possible that they just
4:46
sit out the election or vote for a third party candidate and in a state like Michigan that would be a huge deal with
4:54
huge consequences Biden won in 2020 with only roughly 150,000 votes and in 2016
5:03
Clinton lost by just 11,000 votes if even a portion of arab-american Voters
5:10
decide not to vote for Biden it could have huge consequences for the state and even the country wow so huge Stakes yes
5:19
and the question really becomes how big is this movement and how deep does that anger
5:26
run oh there it is wow I know oh it's right next to a so I went to Detroit along with
5:32
producers ASA Chini and CLA tennis gutter to really understand how this
5:38
strategy was resonating in the Arab American Community were those Rank and
5:43
file voters really rallying around this effort this urge to register their anger
5:50
by voting against Biden at The Ballot Box we are outside at the Islamic Center
5:56
of Detroit where they are about to start noon prayers so we started with going to a mosque for
6:02
Friday prayers and this is just outside of Dearborn in Detroit and there are
6:09
hundreds of people gathered there for noon Friday prayers La shenny
6:15
hi and we met up with a woman Latifa Jamal don't vote for Biden who was
6:21
handing out flyers urging people to abandon Biden not to vote for Biden who going to
6:28
for vot no okay and the level of frustration not I'm not voting for that and dismay no
6:36
nobody and betrayal so what Biden no was
6:42
just clearly evident that's not to vote for Biden yeah I know like I'm in the group oh in the group and of the roughly
6:49
50 or so people we heard from I love only one person said that he
6:56
was sticking with Biden wow I love Biden I know after we were doing in G I'm
7:03
sorry about it this is a way did you vote for him in 2020 I did almost everyone we heard from
7:10
outside the mosque said they voted for Biden in 2020 but now said they weren't so sure is there anything he could do to
7:18
gain back your vote so when we asked people what Biden could do to win back their vote of course stop this massacre
7:26
many said ceasefire at a minimum I I don't think so unless he goes send the Army and create a Palestinian State and
7:34
reimburse all every Palestinian but many said they wanted more we know how Biden has reacted in a situation now we can't
7:40
think about what if for me at least I can't say by and stand that I need to get him [Music]
7:46
out so Jenny I guess you know listening to you talk to people it feels a little
7:53
tricky to me because the us obviously you know is an important and Powerful Ally of Israel but it is a separate
8:00
country from Israel so I guess I'm wondering you know how the people you
8:06
were talking to process that I mean Biden is fundamentally not the boss of
8:12
Netanyahu you know the US doesn't have the power to actually stop the war and stop the bombing I think for many of
8:19
these voters it's not all that complicated they see this through the lens of us support for Israel not just
8:27
support of the war now but also so Decades of policy of billions of dollars
8:32
of Aid going toward Israel that Aid is mostly unconditional and even though in recent
8:39
weeks you've seen Biden shift his rhetoric a little bit he spoke from the
8:44
White House calling Israel's reaction over the top these voters see that rhetoric as basically empty and they see
8:53
nothing short of a fundamental policy shift as enough and what has the Biden Administration been saying saying in the
8:59
face of this criticism I mean has Biden responded I think his administration has
9:04
tried they've sent White House officials and foreign policy officials to do
9:10
listening sessions where they kind of apologize and express regret for some of the past actions basically saying they
9:17
should have done more to indicate that they value Palestinian lives and then
9:22
just this weekend Democrat rokana a congressman from California went and
9:28
tried to sort of Step In unofficially for the Biden campaign and try to sort of reassure voters but I don't know that
9:35
any of that has done much reassuring at all because the level of anger that they
9:40
have just goes beyond wanting to be heard they don't think listening is enough and they want to see action okay
9:47
so it's clear from your reporting that a lot of people are very upset with Biden but I guess that raises the question
9:54
about the alternative about Trump I mean this is the president who brought the
9:59
country the Muslim ban as we remember from the early days of his term and you know it's also the guy who broke with
10:05
years of American tradition on where the US Embassy in Israel should be based I mean he moved it to Jerusalem from Tel
10:12
aiv so the question in my mind is do you think at the end of the day Jenny you
10:18
know when all of these voters are staring at their options that they'll ultimately just hold their nose and vote
10:24
for Biden so there's really two groups of people
10:31
there's the people who are voting and focus on today on voting uncommitted and registering a threat and are leaving
10:38
open the possibility of going back to Biden come November but then there's a whole
10:44
another group of people and it's a large group of people who are already saying forget it I'm done I'm definitely not
10:51
going to vote for Biden in November they understand the stakes they understand the consequences and still
10:59
still they've made up their [Music]
11:08
[Music] mind we'll be right
11:16
[Music]
11:27
back so Jenny you said that you talked to
11:33
democratic voters in Michigan who said that they were not going to vote for Biden really no matter what despite the
11:40
prospect of trump how did they talk about that so I went to speak with a longtime
11:47
Democrat and Palestinian American activists who lives in the suburbs of
11:52
Detroit hi hello her name is ter a she is 67 years old and she lives with her
12:00
husband Bob Morris and their dog JV
12:05
JV and almost from the moment you walk in their home it becomes clear that
12:12
being a Democrat is a central part of her identity this is a Obama's book it's
12:19
clear from the books that she has on her coffee table my husband with President Kennedy and his
12:25
father it's clear from the walls of photos that she and Bob have which is
12:31
just a sort of who's who in Democratic politics stretching back decades really
12:37
kept on and as you see President Bill Clinton at the time you call it a wall of politicians but they're all Democrats
12:45
Democrats we don't have really yeah we always V for the best person they just
12:51
happen to be Democrats I voted Republic and we sat down in their dining room sir can you
12:57
just start by telling us a a little bit about your childhood what life was like
13:02
where you were so I grew up in rala which is west of
13:09
Jerusalem and Terry told us about growing up in rala in the West Bank and
13:14
she said it was basically a calm happy childhood until she was about 10 years old and that's what I call introduction
13:21
to hell and that's in 1967 the Arab Israeli War broke out and Terry's family
13:26
and neighbors sheltered together in her house we ended up with 30 people in our basement and it's a very small basement
13:34
and all of a sudden the bomb starts you know the scream starts and all of a
13:40
sudden and it just kind of like boom boom boom and then the radio and then
13:48
people start praying and then they were crowded together in that basement as
13:53
tanks rolled in there's no way to describe the horror
14:01
that you see the the crying the smell the fear oh after the war Terry's
14:09
parents grew really anxious about her and her sister's safety So eventually
14:14
they were sent to live with her uncle in the suburbs of Detroit Michigan and when she gets there she got a job in a local
14:21
restaurant she eventually graduates from high school and then after just a few years she falls into politics basically
14:28
by accident a Democrat asks her if she wants to volunteer for a candidate running for the state house and almost
14:35
immediately she just but I stuffed envelope like my life dependent on it I
14:42
will come in and they say you want to come in at 5:00 in the morning and lick stamps I would come in at 5:00 in the
14:49
morning Lick's a sucker boor every at this point Terry throws herself
14:55
head first into politics she's volunteering on local elections and she's also getting involved with
15:01
national Democratic politics um so I was one of the first people there pushed for
15:07
Bill Clinton worked on his campaign I was working my regular job and working
15:13
basically after 5 till whenever 11:00 12:00 whatever to get Bill Clinton
15:22
elected and what's she trying to accomplish with these campaigns I think it's two things on the local level she
15:29
recognizes the immediacy of government in action to create real change in her
15:34
own backyard and then I think with some of these more National campaigns she's really hoping to push for change for
15:40
Palestinians and influence the Democratic party's foreign policy so I a
15:46
believer that you cannot just stand on the outside and scream why don't you work
15:53
within the system and within the system things will change mhm and then like
15:58
many Democrats she's really shocked when Trump wins and enters office horror horror tell me about that
16:06
I look at Trump and I tremble with fear she's horrified the day he gets elected
16:13
the day he got elected I really could not she's shocked by the Muslim ban I
16:19
was just petrified you know that my nephew whose name is Muhammad is going
16:25
to be injured because of all the hate that is directed at she's horrified by
16:32
the decision to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem just when you think he cannot get any lower
16:38
he gets lower so when 2020 comes around after Biden becomes the Democratic nominee Terry spends a lot of time and
16:46
effort calling up friends and family members and acquaintances trying to convince them to show up and vote for
16:51
Biden and the presidential election and then I just said let's work and start
16:57
convincing all all the people that were in opposition so what was that pitch
17:02
give me the pitch that you gave to people at that time it's either Biden or Trump and Trump is hates
17:10
Muslim hates Arab hate everybody if you're not white you're not
17:18
going to be a person that is going to be represented and it's so it was not that
17:23
Biden is a quality it's there is a bad and terrible we don't want the terrible
17:31
it's not that she's this huge Biden supporter but when Biden becomes the Democratic notman she supports him and
17:39
when he announces he's going to run again in 2024 she still supports him but then October 7th
17:45
happens right and so for Terry she immediately thinks back to her experience in
17:51
1967 and anticipates what she thinks will be an aggressive Israeli response
17:56
immediately after I knew knew because I live through what Israel does when when
18:03
the Palestinian perpetrate violence I knew there was going to be hell to be
18:09
paid and Jenny does Terry talk about the role of Hamas in this War I mean the fact that Hamas perpetrated this violent
18:17
attack on Israel on October 7th so Terry kept talking about how she really thinks
18:22
of herself as a pacifist and so I asked her about this pacifist does any of you
18:28
any part of you put the blame on Hamas yes because they used they used
18:36
violence so yes but to me the question that I would ask should the Palestinian
18:44
indigenous people of that land do they have the right to defend themselves and
18:50
she said quite clearly that she disagrees with the use of violence but it's also clear that she feels quite
18:57
conflicted and really sees Palestinians as in an impossible position if you are
19:02
the desperate person in Gaza who have no
19:08
options what would you do that's and then as the weeks and the war dragged on and Israel continued its
19:16
bombardment she really became very angry with her own country with Biden's
19:21
response to the war every human being's life matter but
19:27
he de finished the tragedy of Palestinian by him going and embracing
19:35
Netanyahu almost immediately she's really enraged by Biden's decision to
19:40
fly to Israel very quickly to embrace Netanyahu and to offer basically unequivocal support for the War I kept
19:48
saying he will self-correct somebody or the policy
19:53
makers will change but she tries to be patient and she sort of has this
19:59
expectation that Biden is going to change his mind or withdraw some support and and as the time went
20:06
by it got even worse and as it becomes more and more clear that that's not
20:12
going to happen everything Israel wants they
20:18
[Music] get what does that say that my life does it matter she really begins to think
20:26
that's it I can't vote for him not in the primary and not in November you want my vote you cannot
20:34
kill my people in my name as simple as
20:40
[Music] that how do you wrestle with the fact
20:45
that that decision could help Trump win it's a very hard
20:53
decision but it is not me who's putting
20:59
Trump in place it's the president
21:05
himself I'm not at fault that people like me are not going
21:10
to vote for him it's his policy and his action so don't put the blame on me put
21:18
it on him he knows that my vote will be for him if his actions are different and
21:26
so is that me basically saying I demand more of my leaders yeah
21:35
why not I mean you're saying look this isn't my fault this isn't it's not because of
21:42
me Biden should change is there anything that you think that Trump is going to do
21:49
better for Palestinians I have zero confidence in Trump
21:56
period there's not one iota of anything I want from Trump I want him to go away
22:04
but I am sad for our country that we do not have viable
22:12
alternatives on both sides but it's the system that we have yes it's the only
22:18
system that we have and it's a system that you participated in yes
22:23
enthusiastically for decades absolutely so I have two bad candidates so what is my alternative I don't have
22:31
Alternatives I am not represented I know I'm in a place where I am going nowhere
22:38
that's how hopeless would I stand Jenny it's really striking that
22:44
you know four years ago Terry looked at this exact same choice and felt pretty
22:49
clear that to her Trump was a worse option than Biden I mean so much so that she campaigned for Biden right but now
22:57
she looks at the two and sees them as equally bad options like that's a pretty
23:02
remarkable shift not least because you know these are two very different leaders when it comes to the Palestinian
23:09
issue Trump is much closer to the Netanyahu government and a whole range of things things that she'd probably be
23:15
pretty opposed to so how does she SN that in her mind I think for Terry she
23:21
really sees not that much difference between Biden and Trump she sees this as
23:28
sort of subtleties that don't matter in the long run because of what's happening in Gaza this person hates me this person
23:36
want me killed that's all what it is but Terry understands that not everybody
23:41
sees it that way and that's clear even in her own conversations with her husband Bob and it's worth noting here
23:49
that Bob's family is Jewish but he says there's really no daylight between him and Terry on the Israeli Palestinian
23:55
conflict and maybe the only thing they disagree about is the role of President Biden and then Bob and I we talked MH
24:04
and so they remembered this fight they had on the drive back home from Thanksgiving with Bob's family we're
24:10
driving on the freeway leaving DC and what trigger it is something on the
24:17
radio and they said Biden and Palestine at the same
24:25
time I think Biden was saying something about compassion and they say they heard
24:33
someone say something about Biden but in the meantime he was doing things with Gaza
24:39
and I kind of like I basically said to Bob I just
24:45
don't understand how horrible of a human being he is and I said and Terry
24:51
remembers just erupting he's such a hypocrite and I was probably saying you
24:57
you know the Supreme Court and Trump you know or something else and I don't buy
25:05
it anymore and I don't and then he blew up and Bob remembers getting really
25:12
emotional I just had a breakdown I said I just can't take it anymore and and I mean when I say I had
25:20
a breakdown I'm driving the damn car and uh and I'm I'm starting to cry and
25:27
what's going through your mind T Bob there's nobody I love more on this Earth than
25:34
Terry but if I say anything I'm a bad
25:43
guy and Terry understood she felt really bad we're 95% on everything except he
25:50
sees Biden via the prism of the Supreme Court I'm looking at at it from the
25:58
prison of Palestine I mean it sounds like you're saying you're already seeing things crumble and you're saying this is
26:05
our last chance before things Crum well to be fair I wanted Biden to run I did
26:12
want him to be a one- termer you did yes uhhuh I wanted him I truly thought he
26:19
could be a guy who's writes the ship and in some ways he has Biden did get
26:27
successful legislation passed in a bipartisan way and some of his legislation is really
26:34
good but um he wasn't as good as I had hoped but why do you why will you stick
26:41
with him Donald Trump I mean I am very concerned about our
26:47
democracy I think it is entirely possible the Democrats could win the
26:56
house and the Senate and the presidency this time and that can make a big big
27:03
difference in terms of how we can make some positive changes and that's a hope
27:08
I guess I'm a a short-term pessimist and a long-term Optimist you know so he see
27:15
things and I see I see potential he doesn't he sees okay this is our system this is how it's always been I'm looking
27:22
at it it's about time to really fix the system that we have it's a system that's
27:28
not working for the majority of American we are not represented but it sounds
27:33
like what you're saying is the system is already broken and the only way to fix it is
27:39
to break it more no um I don't believe in Breaking I I believe in
27:45
building the destruction is not my intention
27:52
here I mean I cannot tell you how sad and disheartening
27:58
that I have to do this because that is the last thing I want to do to basically
28:05
say I know I told you the last time
28:10
Biden is not the best but he is not Trump and please please vote for
28:16
him and now I'm telling you refrain because
28:21
maybe maybe they would start seeing us as a human being deserving
28:28
of a living Terry really sees this election in very Stark terms it's not
28:35
just about November it's about the future of her party but when it comes to the future of her party she's basically
28:41
a single isue voter right I mean the Supreme Court climate change those
28:47
things just don't matter to her as much as this other issue the Palestinian issue and she's willing to risk all of
28:55
that in this election for that issue right though I think Terry would
29:01
turn that right around and say that it's President Biden who is taking the risk here from her perspective he is the one
29:10
who is willing to lose the election over his continued support for
29:15
[Music]
29:21
Israel I am conflicted to the tilt
29:29
but uh my political engagement my being in the system is not
29:37
as important to me as saving the children that are
29:46
dying I know Terry thank you so so much really
29:51
pleasure Mee you thank you thank you so much Terry really app oh I
30:01
appr so Jenny it really seems like the fight that Terry and Bob are having you
30:06
know this conflict inside their marriage is a lot like what's happening inside the Democratic party right now I mean
30:13
these are the battle lines right and the question is what does this mean for the
30:18
election like how many terries and how many Bobs are there out there whose view
30:24
is going to Prevail who's going to win exactly we really don't know and the
30:31
Michigan primary is really the first test of all of this the organizers of
30:36
the uncommitted campaign say they're hoping for something like 10,000 votes which is roughly how much Clinton lost
30:43
the state by but that's actually quite a small number because we've always seen some percentage of uncommitted in a
30:49
Michigan primary so for this to really make an impact for it really to worry
30:55
the Biden White House we'd probably need to see something with tens of thousands
31:00
of votes and Michigan is not the only place we're going to see this play out
31:06
there will be similar debates I think in Georgia in Pennsylvania maybe even other swing
31:14
States and really no matter what happens regardless of whether terries or the
31:20
bobbs Prevail in this election the truth is the fight in the Democratic party is
31:25
really just beginning this is going to have a profound impact on the party
31:31
younger voters attitudes towards Israel is very different and they are becoming a bigger voting Force so the politics
31:39
are changing and that has the potential to really reshape America's decades long
31:44
foreign policy in the Middle
31:50
East Jenny thank you thank you so [Music]
31:56
much we'll be right
32:12
back here's what else you need to know today Mr chief justice and may it please the court on Monday the Supreme Court
32:19
heard arguments in two First Amendment cases challenging laws in Florida and
32:24
Texas which aim to limit company ability to moderate content on their platforms
32:31
the platforms do not have a First Amendment right to apply their censorship policies in an inconsistent
32:36
Manner and to censor and deplatform certain users I welcome your questions
32:42
