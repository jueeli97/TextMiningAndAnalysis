A Deadly Aid Delivery and Growing Threat of Famine in Gaza



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
Tavern and this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:09
daily late last week an effort to get
0:12
food into Northern Gaza turned deadly as
0:16
thousands of desperate Gins descended on
0:18
Aid trucks and Israeli troops tasked
0:21
with guarding those trucks open fire but
0:25
exactly how people died and who was
0:27
responsible remains contested
0:32
today my colleague Hiba ybec on what we
0:36
know about what happened and what it
0:38
tells us about hunger in
0:43
Gaza it's Tuesday March
0:53
5th so Hiba we are now in the fifth
0:56
month of Israel's war against Hamas in
1:00
Gaza and for weeks we've been hearing
1:02
about negotiations over a ceasefire and
1:06
a hostage
1:08
exchange and then late last week there
1:10
was a disaster surrounding an aid Convoy
1:14
that was brought into Gaza you've been
1:16
reporting on what happened tell us about
1:19
it so last Thursday there was a deadly
1:22
disaster involving civilians possibly
1:25
the deadliest disaster since the war
1:27
started nearly 5 months ago in which 118
1:31
Palestinians were killed and more than
1:33
760 were wounded in Gaza City but there
1:37
are conflicting reports on how they died
1:39
and what exactly happened the Israeli
1:42
military has one account of what
1:45
happened and the Gaza Health Ministry
1:48
and Witnesses have another account so my
1:52
colleagues and I started digging into
1:53
the details we started calling people
1:56
piecing together a picture of what had
1:58
actually happened there
2:00
and what did you find when you guys
2:02
started really looking into this so
2:04
first let me just give you the context
2:07
of what happened this happened in
2:09
Northern Gaza the place that has been at
2:12
War the longest that's where Israeli
2:15
Ground Forces began their invasion of
2:17
the Gaza Strip many people have left the
2:20
north but we do know that some 300,000
2:24
people are still there and the people
2:26
who have remained there are really
2:28
living through very desperate conditions
2:31
very little Aid has come in to the north
2:34
of Gaza since the war started and
2:36
especially in recent weeks and food is
2:39
is barely available for the people
2:42
who've remained there and the UN has
2:44
been warning of a famine that is looming
2:46
over the territory and Hiba why is there
2:49
so little Aid getting into Northern Gaza
2:52
in particular well first of all there's
2:56
less Aid getting into the Gaza Strip in
2:59
general enal not just the north there's
3:02
multiple reasons as to why that is but
3:05
one of the main reasons is that Israel
3:07
itself has been very slow to approve
3:11
permits and often denies permits for
3:14
eight trucks and eight convoys to come
3:17
in specifically to the north because
3:20
Israel says that they don't want the aid
3:23
to end up in the hands of Hamas that
3:25
they don't want them to get a hold of of
3:28
the packages got it and when Israel does
3:31
approve the permits and the eight trucks
3:34
start their Journeys there's multiple
3:36
hurdles that they have to go through in
3:38
order to actually deliver it to the
3:40
people some of these hurdles include the
3:43
widespread destruction in Gaza there's
3:46
vast damage across the Gaza Strip roads
3:49
have been destroyed there's Rubble
3:51
everywhere and it's very difficult for
3:53
the trucks to actually move through that
3:56
rubble and and through those roads and
3:58
then these eight convoys have to go
4:00
through multiple Israeli checkpoints on
4:02
the way and there's often significant
4:04
delays at these checkpoints by Israeli
4:06
soldiers who are inspecting the aid this
4:09
makes it hard for the trucks to make it
4:11
from where they enter in the South all
4:13
the way to the north in the specific
4:15
safety window that they're given and
4:18
sometimes they make it halfway through
4:20
and they turn around because they got
4:21
delayed so much that they can't keep
4:23
going but there's a particular problem
4:26
with the north where fighting has been
4:28
going on the longest
4:30
the Civil order is now breaking down
4:32
essentially we know that frequent
4:34
Israeli strikes on Palestinian policemen
4:37
meant that there's really no one to run
4:39
security for official groups and for Aid
4:42
convoys leaving them vulnerable to
4:45
attacks by local gangs who are trying to
4:47
steal the aid and sell it or profit off
4:50
of it and also hungry and desperate
4:53
civilians who are trying to grab the aid
4:55
and take as much as they can which you
4:58
know means that they end up stealing
5:00
some of it looting some of it while it's
5:03
still on the way right so it's like
5:05
lawlessness and effectively social order
5:08
breakdown I mean this is kind of the
5:10
downstream effects of extended war in a
5:14
particular place right there's a power
5:16
vacuum and that situation you know can
5:18
be very difficult for an organization
5:21
like the United Nations to be able to
5:23
operate
5:25
safely right and the few a trucks that
5:27
do come in have had to either suspend
5:30
their aid deliveries into the North or
5:32
have not been able to deliver Aid there
5:35
the last time hwa the UN agency in
5:37
charge of Palestinian refugees tried to
5:40
bring trucks to the north was nearly a
5:42
month ago but they said that one of
5:44
their convoys came under Fire and
5:48
another major Aid provider the world
5:50
food program said that they haven't
5:52
delivered Aid there in over three weeks
5:55
and they cited all of the reasons we
5:57
talked about for this suspension so
5:59
while Aid hasn't been coming into the
6:01
north people have been growing more
6:03
desperate and hungry and the situation
6:05
there has been getting worse which has
6:06
been raising International alarm and
6:10
there's been increased calls on Israel
6:13
to let Aid go through to the north and
6:16
to alleviate the suffering of the
6:19
residents there so Israel partnered with
6:22
these local Palestinian businessmen in
6:25
Gaza and they promised to secure the
6:28
eight convoys that the businessmen would
6:30
Supply and that would make their way
6:32
into the North and they successfully did
6:35
this three times last week so people
6:39
started being very hopeful that more
6:40
would come and ahead of the fourth
6:42
delivery they started to gather at this
6:45
distribution point right outside of Gaza
6:47
City in the north and that brings us to
6:50
Thursday's
6:52
incident so last Thursday around 4:45
6:56
a.m. around 388 trucks reach this
7:00
distribution point and they start
7:02
getting closer to the crowds of people
7:03
who had camped there overnight waiting
7:06
for this Aid to
7:08
come and when the people see the trucks
7:11
coming they're very desperate they
7:13
surround them they get on top of
7:16
them and then at some point Israeli
7:19
soldiers start firing shots and then it
7:22
turned violent very fast and it ended
7:26
with 118 Palestinians dead and 760
7:31
injured and this is where the accounts
7:37
diverge okay so let's start with the
7:40
Israeli account what did they say
7:43
happened so the Israeli military said
7:45
that it was trying to secure the Convoy
7:47
and it had tanks nearby to make sure
7:50
that the Convoy reached the area and it
7:54
did acknowledge that its troops had
7:55
opened fire at the crowd but they said
7:58
that they open opened fire when a
8:01
violent crowd or a violent mob
8:03
approached their troops and endangered
8:06
their lives and they said the shots that
8:09
were fired weren't really the reason why
8:11
so many people died but the reason that
8:13
so many people died was because in the
8:16
chaos of all of it they trampled each
8:19
other and many had died from Suffocation
8:21
or trampling and also that the trucks
8:24
had run over some of the people who were
8:26
trying to run away oh God so the
8:29
Israelis don't deny actually shooting
8:31
but they say it was more about
8:33
controlling the crowd kind of as warning
8:36
shots type thing and that this was not
8:38
the way people actually died they say
8:40
the way people actually died was
8:41
Suffocation or being crushed by the aid
8:43
trucks themselves right and what did the
8:47
gazen health authorities say so the
8:49
gazen health authorities have actually
8:51
been calling this the flower Massacre or
8:53
the massacre of the hungry stomachs
8:56
because what they're saying is that
8:58
Israeli forces is fired at a crowd of
9:00
hungry and desperate people who are
9:02
waiting for Aid and Witnesses and
9:06
Palestinians who were there have said
9:09
that although some people were trampled
9:11
and possibly run over by the trucks that
9:14
was not the main reason for the high
9:16
death toll most of the people who were
9:19
injured or killed were injured and
9:22
killed by Israeli fire so the Gau and
9:26
health authorities are essentially
9:27
saying this was a Massacre by Israel
9:31
right do we know Hiba what actually did
9:34
happen what have you guys found in your
9:36
reporting well the Israeli military
9:39
released Drone footage that it claimed
9:41
showed a mass Stampede in which Gins are
9:45
trampled but that video only added to
9:48
the confusion of the sequence of events
9:51
and the quality and the lengths of the
9:53
clips made it more difficult to confirm
9:55
these claims right it was just grainy
9:58
there was no sound you saw people
10:01
scramble and run but you didn't
10:03
understand why right the Drone footage
10:06
was heavily edited and it left out key
10:08
moments but it did show hundreds of
10:11
people circling around the trucks and
10:13
hoping to catch a bag of flour and then
10:16
suddenly we see people start to panic
10:19
and run in multiple directions and then
10:22
they released another clip in which we
10:24
see two Israeli tanks that are
10:26
positioned about A4 mile down the road
10:29
and then we see about a dozen bodies
10:31
lying around them and we see people
10:34
crawling and ducking for
10:36
cover but we did have another video that
10:41
was released by Al
10:43
jazer and it showed a crowd near the a
10:47
convoy and it also captured the sound of
10:50
gunfire and showed multiple Tracer
10:53
rounds which is a special type of
10:55
ammunition that helps troops fine-tune
10:57
their targeting when it's dark and the
10:59
Tracer rounds originated from the
11:01
direction of a nearby Israeli military
11:04
base so although that did not conclude
11:07
that the shots came from the direction
11:09
of the Israeli military it did add
11:12
another layer of evidence so H it sounds
11:15
like these videos are suggestive but not
11:19
conclusive but what are the people you
11:22
spoke to on the ground say the
11:24
eyewitnesses and survivors and doctors
11:27
you spoke with right we spoke to
11:29
Witnesses and survivors as well as
11:32
doctors at the hospitals that have taken
11:34
in the people who were wounded and
11:37
killed and they said that most of the
11:39
people had died or were wounded by
11:42
gunshots and the Doctor Who runs one of
11:45
the four main hospitals in the area that
11:47
took in the casualties told me that out
11:50
of the 13 people who were killed and the
11:53
170 people who were wounded that the
11:56
hospital took in all of the injuries
11:59
were of gunshot wounds he said that they
12:02
didn't see any injuries that coincided
12:05
with those of a stampede or people being
12:08
run over by trucks and that account
12:12
Echoes the ones that we've heard from
12:14
Witnesses and people who were there who
12:16
saw people get shot and fall to the
12:18
ground next to them but in the chaos of
12:21
everything people were not checking
12:23
who's dead and who's wounded they were
12:25
just taking the flower and they were
12:26
running for their
12:27
lives
12:31
and although the accounts differ on both
12:33
sides what we do know is that many
12:36
hungry and desperate people died while
12:38
trying to get food and secure Aid in a
12:41
place where famine is looming and
12:44
starvation is rampant and that's what I
12:47
spent the last few weeks reporting on
12:50
I'm trying to understand how people in
12:52
the north of Gaza specifically are
12:54
surviving with such little
12:57
food
12:59
[Music]
13:05
[Music]
13:13
[Music]
13:21
we'll be right
13:25
back so Hiba I want to talk about what
13:29
people are doing to survive in Northern
13:31
Gaza but before we get to that what is
13:33
the big picture on the state of hunger
13:36
in
13:38
Gaza hunger has reached unprecedented
13:41
levels in Gaza and specifically in
13:43
Northern Gaza and we're starting to
13:46
already see reports of children dying
13:48
from malnutrition and dehydration and
13:51
this week the health Ministry said that
13:53
15 children have died from malnutrition
13:56
and dehydration at just one of Northern
13:59
gaza's hospitals wow 15 children have
14:02
actually died yes and and we also have
14:05
the UN and eight organizations saying
14:08
that one in six children in Northern
14:10
Gaza were acutely malnutritioned and
14:12
that more than 90% of children under two
14:16
are facing severe food poverty and the
14:20
UN humanitarian coordinator said that a
14:23
quarter of all gazen residents are one
14:27
step away from famine
14:29
and how exactly are people surviving
14:32
Hiba I mean you're talking to people in
14:34
Northern Gaza what are they
14:36
saying I've been reporting on Hunger for
14:39
weeks and I've talked to people about
14:41
what they're doing in order to survive
14:43
with such little
14:51
food and I recently talked to one woman
14:53
whose experience is very typical in
14:57
Northern Gaza
15:00
her name is she's a 23-year-old woman
15:04
from the north who stayed in the north
15:07
and didn't flee and tell me about
15:12
Gada Gada is one of 10 kids she has six
15:16
sisters and three
15:18
brothers and she's actually gaza's first
15:20
female solar power engineer she's won
15:24
many awards
15:25
internationally and she's also the
15:29
provider for her family and she's used
15:31
the money that she won from these grants
15:34
and competitions to help her family
15:36
through this war and with that money she
15:39
actually stockpiled a bunch of food in
15:42
the beginning of the war expecting the
15:45
situation to deteriorate she bought
15:48
flour and milk and canned food and
15:51
everything they might need and they
15:54
stockpiled it in their home and how is
15:57
it that they're still in Northern Gaza
16:00
well actually they tried to stay in
16:02
their home for as long as they possibly
16:04
could until the ground fighting really
16:07
basically reached their
16:12
doorstep and at one point early on
16:15
during Israel's ground invasion of the
16:20
north Israeli soldiers came to their
16:22
building and they forced them out they
16:26
asked everyone to leave the building and
16:28
they did Ed all of the men and the boys
16:30
who were later
16:32
released and she was forced to leave
16:35
with nothing they took nothing with them
16:37
like many other Goins and they moved
16:40
they moved 12 times since one of those
16:44
times was to the South where they got
16:47
there and they realized that it actually
16:48
wasn't much safer it wasn't better for
16:51
them so they realized that they should
16:53
probably just go back to the north and
16:55
stay as close as possible to their home
16:58
in in case they're able to go back later
17:01
but that never happened because Israeli
17:03
forces took up their home as a military
17:06
base and they were there for two weeks
17:08
she
17:14
said after they'd left 2 weeks later she
17:17
went back to check on her home and it
17:20
was burned there was nothing left
17:22
including the food that she
17:24
[Music]
17:26
stockpiled and now she's Sheltering with
17:30
50 members of her extended family
17:33
including children in a two-bedroom
17:35
apartment in the
17:37
North 50 people in a two-bedroom
17:41
apartment that is
17:43
extraordinary so what did they do for
17:45
food early in the war well she told me
17:49
that in the beginning of the war they
17:51
still were able to find some things to
17:53
buy and eat like rice and vegetables but
18:04
she said that by the end of December
18:06
basically when Aid to the north became
18:09
less frequent and things that they were
18:12
eating had started to run out including
18:14
flour which became much less available
18:17
and much more
18:18
expensive they didn't know what to do I
18:22
mean they had nothing to eat so they
18:24
started mixing water with starch to eat
18:27
they were having one meal the day and
18:29
the children were constantly hungry so
18:32
they had to find an alternative and that
18:34
alternative was animal
18:38
food so she told me that they started
18:42
grinding up really any animal food that
18:44
they could find
18:46
so rabbit food and bird food and hay and
18:52
fodder really anything that they could
18:54
get their hands on and they would use
18:57
that to make bread bread with but the
18:59
bread was very dry and it smelled bad it
19:02
tasted bad and it made their stomachs
19:05
hurt but she said that the one that was
19:08
the worst for her was the bird
19:14
food she said the bird food tasted and
19:17
smelled as if you were sitting with a
19:19
bunch of chicken the smell was very bad
19:22
and the taste was even
19:27
worse
19:30
but she told me that even though this
19:32
stuff tasted and smelled bad they really
19:35
tried to make it as less awful as
19:38
possible she told me that one of her
19:41
cousins Sheltering with her loved to
19:43
bake and she made really tasty sweets
19:45
before the war so basically she tried to
19:48
make the most out of these ingredients
19:50
and she was making desserts using the
19:53
cornmeal and the rabbit food and she was
19:57
also making other Savory dishes that
19:59
they liked and they ate frequently
20:02
before the
20:04
war she use the animal feed to make Maul
20:08
which is the Palestinian version of
20:11
cuscus so she was making it with the
20:14
groundup animal feed yes but that was
20:17
still not enough at that point G and her
20:20
family were only eating one meal a day
20:23
and that was not enough for them or the
20:25
children in the
20:27
family
20:32
she told me that her little sister
20:34
2-year-old elen who's actually the
20:37
youngest person Sheltering with them was
20:40
hungry all the time she was going to
20:42
sleep crying and waking up crying and
20:45
she loved milk but they ran out of milk
20:49
more than two months ago so what they've
20:50
been doing is basically giving her
20:53
expired juice it was actually not even
20:56
juice it's a concentrated juice that
20:57
they would mix with water and because it
21:00
was expired it was making her sick but
21:03
that was the only thing that they could
21:04
give her in place of milk and when they
21:07
were able to they would give her sugar
21:10
cane that they would find in the market
21:13
and lemons as a snack and sometimes when
21:15
those weren't even available they would
21:17
just give her gum to chew on and and
21:20
stop crying to silence her
21:27
hunger so I asked her if they had been
21:29
able to get any Aid since the war
21:31
started and she told me that her brother
21:33
Muhammad who's 30 years old had been
21:36
going to the distribution site and
21:39
sleeping on the beach just waiting for
21:41
Aid he would leave at 7 in the morning
21:44
and come back at 3:00 a.m. and he slept
21:47
there for 3 days this week so her
21:49
brother had been sleeping on the beach
21:52
in hopes that there would be Aid dropped
21:54
off here so what
21:57
happened so after waiting for hours near
22:01
the distribution site on
22:03
Thursday he saw the eight trucks coming
22:07
and along with the crowd he ran towards
22:10
them and
22:13
suddenly when the chaos erupted he just
22:15
started seeing people dropping to the
22:17
ground and he's actually deaf and mute
22:21
so he didn't know what was happening he
22:23
just saw people get shot and fall to the
22:25
ground in front of him she told me that
22:27
he saw saw someone get shot in the head
22:29
right next to him God and in the middle
22:32
of all the chaos and the Bloodshed he
22:35
was actually able to grab a bag of flour
22:38
and he just took it and started running
22:41
really fast he was just trying to get
22:43
away and hold on to that bag of flour
22:46
that he was able to get and while
22:49
leaving the site he saw this little kid
22:52
who was also able to grab a bag of flour
22:55
but she said that he told her that the
22:57
kid was was stopped by local gang
22:59
members who had attacked him and grabbed
23:03
the bag of flour from him they stole it
23:05
from him and R's brother just kept
23:08
running until he got home finally and he
23:12
came home after 3 days of sleeping in
23:14
the sand with a bag of
23:17
flour God a terrifying night
23:21
mhm but that was the first time they've
23:24
had flower in months since since
23:29
December basically so obviously they
23:32
wanted to make bread but that bag was a
23:35
25 kog bag of flour and again there were
23:39
50 people Sheltering in one apartment so
23:42
they had to make it last them as long as
23:44
possible so it could feed all the
23:46
members of the family so actually what
23:48
they're doing now is they're mixing the
23:50
flower with animal feed still they're
23:53
doing one cup of flour with three cups
23:56
of animal feed to stretch it out for as
23:59
long as possible and they're making
24:00
bread with it she said that it was
24:03
better but still not normal bread it was
24:07
not what they were
24:18
craving you know they've been through so
24:21
much since the war started they've seen
24:23
people killed they've seen dead bodies
24:26
they've been displaced 12 times they've
24:29
lost friends and family members but she
24:32
said that now with the hunger and the
24:34
starvation in the north it's really the
24:37
worst thing they've gone through since
24:38
the beginning of the war she said that
24:41
she's seeing people kids who are
24:44
rumaging through trash trying to find
24:46
anything to
24:47
eat and so she said that people were
24:51
still going back to that same
24:53
distribution site she even said that
24:55
more people were going back on the beach
24:57
and waiting and camping out and sleeping
25:00
there hoping for more Aid to come and
25:03
she also said that her brother Muhammad
25:05
was also going back every day since
25:07
Thursday hoping to get another bag of
25:10
flour because he was so hungry that he
25:13
wanted to eat anything and risking his
25:15
life for a bag of flour was worth
25:20
it despite the fact that so many people
25:23
had died on Thursday trying to get
25:26
flour the fact that some people did come
25:29
home with a bag of flour that was enough
25:32
for them and others to go back there in
25:35
hopes that more was going to
25:39

intended
26:42
[Music]
26:55
destination we'll be right back
27:11
here's what else you should know today
27:14
on Monday the Supreme Court ruled that
27:16
states may not bar former president
27:19
Donald Trump from running for another
27:21
term rejecting a challenge to Trump's
27:23
eligibility that had threatened to upend
27:26
the presidential race
27:28
the case arose from a challenge brought
27:30
by Colorado voters who cited section
27:33
three of the 14th Amendment a provision
27:36
adopted after the Civil War to forbid
27:39
those who had taken an oath to support
27:41
the Constitution from holding office if
27:44
they engaged in
27:46
Insurrection the justices agreed that
27:48
individual states may not bar candidates
27:51
from the presidency under that
27:53
constitutional provision it was a
27:55
unanimous decision that was largely
28:00
expected and a United Nations report
28:03
released on Monday found quote
28:05
reasonable grounds to believe that
28:07
sexual violence including rape was
28:10
committed in at least three locations in
28:13
Israel during the October 7th attack the
28:16
Nova Music Festival Site Road
28:19
232 and kibutz
28:21
rim the experts also said they had found
28:24
circumstantial evidence that could
28:26
indicate sexual violence had occurred
28:28
with a number of victims mostly women
28:31
who were found fully or partially naked
28:34
bound and shot in addition the UN group
28:38
said it had found clear and convincing
28:40
information based on firsthand accounts
28:42
from released hostages that sexual
28:45
violence including rape was inflicted
28:48
against some women during their time in
28:50
captivity in Gaza the report said that
28:54
the UN team had also heard accounts of
28:56
sexual violence against Palestinians
28:59
that implicated Israeli security forces
29:02
and
