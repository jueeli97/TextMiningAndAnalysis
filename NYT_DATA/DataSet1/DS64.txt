Iranâ€™s Unprecedented Attack on Israel



0:01
I'm Isabelle kersner in Jerusalem it's
0:04
coming up to about 5:30 a.m. at the end
0:08
of a very long and surreal night here
0:12
for the first time in Israel's history
0:16
uh the country came under a direct
0:18
attack from
0:23
Iran this night started
0:26
ominously with cancellations of all educ
0:30
ational activities for Sunday morning
0:33
then the reports on TV that the airport
0:37
was closing down after midnight and
0:43
then came the announcement that swarms
0:46
of drones were actually on their
0:51
way there were lots of diams on TV how
0:55
long it takes drones to arrive how long
0:57
it takes cruise missiles to arrive how
1:00
long it takes ballistic missiles to
1:02
arrive so everybody was basically up and
1:07
[Music]
1:15
waiting sure enough at about 2 a.m. Air
1:18
Raid Sirens were going off in Jerusalem
1:21
very quickly followed by a long series
1:25
of booms in the sky and flashes of light
1:30
wow wow
1:34
wow my apartment building woke carpet
1:38
came to life the neighbors were sitting
1:41
on the stairs in the
1:43
stairwell everybody in this country is
1:45
used to incoming rocket
1:50
fire it was a fairly relaxed
1:54
atmosphere but quite surreal and bizarre
1:57
nonetheless
2:00
[Music]
2:13
and now Dawn is just about breaking I
2:18
can hear bird
2:19
song and we're being told it's not over
2:24
there will be some kind of Israeli
2:26
response and the question is whether
2:30
that will be wrapped up within a couple
2:32
of days or whether we are entering into
2:35
an
2:37
unprecedented Regional
2:40
war from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
2:43
tavernes and this is the
2:47
[Music]
2:53
daily overnight on Saturday Iran
2:56
launched its first direct attack on
2:58
Israeli soil
3:00
shooting hundreds of missiles and drones
3:03
at multiple targets around the
3:06
country today my colleague Eric Schmidt
3:10
on what happened and what it means for
3:14
the risk of a broader war in the Middle
3:17
[Music]
3:22
[Applause]
3:26
East it's Monday April 15
3:30
[Music]
3:36
so Eric we witnessed this extraordinary
3:39
attack overnight on Saturday against
3:41
Israel by Iran you know missiles drones
3:45
lighting up the sky in multiple
3:47
locations around the region the whole
3:49
country was really on high alert I was
3:51
watching New York and it really was like
3:53
the whole world was holding its breath
3:55
with this attack tell me what happened
3:59
at around 9 :00 Israel time we started
4:02
to get intelligence that the Iranians
4:05
had launched a first wave of attack
4:11
drones Iran has basically three buckets
4:15
of weapons that they're launching over
4:17
time against
4:19
[Music]
4:20
Israel so the drones come first they're
4:23
packed with explosives relatively slow
4:25
moving make a lot of noise with their
4:27
buzzing that goes on people can actually
4:29
see them the next wave that's coming
4:32
after this are cruise missiles these are
4:34
larger missiles guided that are headed
4:38
toward Israel at the same time faster
4:40
moving then finally the Iranians launch
4:44
as many as 100 ballistic missiles
4:47
ballistic missiles are the fastest
4:48
moving missiles they carry a big payload
4:51
and what makes them so dangerous is that
4:54
especially if launched in large numbers
4:56
they can overwhelm defenses on the
4:59
ground
5:02
H you've got well over 300 drones and
5:07
missiles of different kinds that have
5:09
been engaged but the thing you have to
5:11
know about these 300 weapons is that the
5:13
vast majority of them are actually shot
5:15
down mostly by Israel but also by allies
5:19
like the United States Britain and
5:21
Jordan and in the end only a dozen or so
5:25
maybe a few more actually impact in
5:27
Israeli territory
5:28
[Music]
5:35
so where do these missiles actually hit
5:38
so you have some damage to this Air Base
5:40
in the n desert you have military
5:42
Targets in the Goan Heights you have
5:45
some injuries on the ground about a
5:46
dozen or so civilians are injured and
5:49
it's unclear whether it's you know from
5:51
the blast themselves or more likely from
5:53
kind of some of the shrapnel and debris
5:55
that's falling from the sky there was
5:57
one seven-year-old girl for instance who
5:59
was severely wounded outside of Arad
6:01
Israel and ban Arab but no fatalities
6:04
that we know of so far uh and no you
6:06
know major injuries which is given the
6:08
scale of this attack is really quite
6:11
remarkable and Eric walk me through why
6:13
this Iranian attack was so clearly
6:16
repelled well there's several main
6:18
reasons one is that the Israelis have a
6:21
very sophisticated layer of defenses the
6:25
best known of them is called Iron Dome
6:27
but it seems here it was another defense
6:30
technology called Aros system that
6:32
shoots down uh ballistic missiles that
6:35
was particularly effective and in
6:37
addition to Israel's already very strong
6:40
defenses you have a number of Israel's
6:42
allies principally the United States uh
6:44
that it's engaging with their combat
6:46
planes they've got F-15 fighter jets up
6:49
in the sky that are shooting down we
6:51
were told more than 70 of these
6:53
exploding drones wow and then you've got
6:55
a couple of US Navy destroyers off the
6:58
coast of Israel in the Eastern
7:00
Mediterranean Sea they take down as many
7:02
as six of these ballistic missiles the
7:05
other thing that's obviously important
7:06
is that Iran gave everyone you know a
7:09
lot of warning this was going to happen
7:11
and we didn't know exactly which bases
7:12
they were going to shoot at we didn't
7:13
know exactly what part of the country
7:15
was going to be attacked but it became
7:17
pretty clear in the messaging that Iran
7:19
did beforehand that they weren't going
7:21
to attack major cities that wasn't the
7:23
goal here that wasn't the objective it
7:25
was going to go after military targets
7:27
uh in the way they did it was pretty
7:29
much as us officials expected the
7:32
Iranians to do H so Eric it seems like
7:35
really at the end of the day this attack
7:37
you know despite its unprecedented
7:39
nature was actually really not nearly as
7:42
bad as it could have been from the
7:44
Israeli perspective but why did Iran
7:47
attack Israel to begin
7:50
with yeah I mean as you said this is
7:52
really from the US and Israeli
7:54
perspective given the vast number of
7:57
drones and missiles that were launched
7:59
at Israel this was a win that they were
8:02
able to get out of this crisis with
8:03
relatively a little damage on the ground
8:06
and all that but for the Iranians you
8:09
have to understand well what prompted
8:10
this in the first
8:12
place the latest now from the Middle
8:15
East Syrian State media reporting that
8:17
an air strike hit Iran's Consular
8:20
building in Syria today and what this is
8:22
really all about was
8:24
retaliation for a strike on April 1st
8:28
that the Israelis carried out in
8:30
Damascus Syria has reportedly killed
8:32
seven members of Iran's Islamic
8:34
revolutionary Gods cor among the dead
8:37
pulled from the rubble a high ranking
8:38
Iranian military leader and even though
8:41
the Israelis haven't come out and
8:42
formally acknowledg this it's clear that
8:44
Israel is behind this Muhammad zahidi
8:47
one of the leaders of Iran's
8:49
revolutionary guard Corps a commander
8:51
that was involved in the weapon
8:53
shipments to groups like Hezbollah and
8:55
Iran backed Syrian Shia militias has
8:58
been targeted in an Israeli air strike
9:00
this afternoon these weren't just any
9:02
old Iranian officers these were a couple
9:05
of their top generals and other senior
9:07
officials from a group called The cuds
9:09
Force it's a wing of the Iranian
9:12
Security Services that carries out
9:14
covert operations across the region in
9:16
places like Gaza in places like
9:20
Lebanon these are the actors that
9:23
organize the very attacks against Israel
9:27
Israel has long targeted Iranian
9:29
military installations in Syria Monday's
9:32
attack marked the first time Iran's
9:34
Embassy compound itself had been hit but
9:37
the other important thing these guys
9:38
weren't killed on some dusty road in a
9:40
military truck in some Battlefield or
9:43
anything like this they were in a
9:44
diplomatic facility this is kind of
9:46
essentially their Sovereign soil in a
9:48
foreign country and if that's violated
9:50
it's a big
9:52
[Music]
9:53
deal so for the Iranians it's not just
9:56
the loss of these key operatives in this
9:59
CT organization that carries out some of
10:01
their most Sinister activities but it's
10:03
almost as if you're carrying out a
10:05
strike on Iranian soil itself this
10:07
Embassy complex and they feel they need
10:11
to respond to this and respond in kind
10:14
respond in force because carrying out an
10:16
attack on Iranian soil effectively was
10:18
really an audacious thing to do
10:21
absolutely and this was so audacious
10:24
that the Israelis didn't tell their
10:26
closest Ally the United States until
10:28
about 5 minutes before the strike is
10:30
going to hit wow American officials were
10:32
not happy not only does it create this
10:35
diplomatic and security challenge but it
10:37
also for Secretary of Defense Lloyd
10:39
Austin it presents a very serious
10:42
problem about what will the response be
10:44
and what kind of threats now will this
10:46
POS to American troops in the Middle
10:48
East so the US does something pretty
10:50
unusual right away one is they come out
10:54
and say publicly that the Israelis
10:56
didn't give them any kind of advanced
10:57
notice of this and the other thing they
10:59
do that's also unusual is the United
11:02
States kind of both publicly but very
11:04
much privately starts to Signal the
11:07
Iranians through back channels that the
11:09
US government had nothing to do with
11:11
this attack on April 1st and the
11:13
Damascus Embassy you know they had no
11:15
prior knowledge of it and were not
11:16
involved in it and so the message to the
11:19
Iranians from Washington is don't blame
11:21
us we know Israel is our key Ally but we
11:24
had no idea this was coming you know we
11:26
don't want to get caught in the blowback
11:29
interesting so the Americans are
11:30
basically saying look Israel we're in
11:32
the middle of a pretty high stake
11:34
situation here there's this war in Gaza
11:37
proxies are firing Rockets into your
11:39
territory it's all kind of on a Harris
11:41
trigger taking this shot at these
11:44
Iranian military officials was not a
11:46
good idea how do the Israelis respond
11:50
what is their explanation to their
11:52
American Allies for killing this top
11:54
Iranian commander on April 1st well the
11:57
Israelis are saying look these are the
11:59
people that are planning attacks on us
12:02
through their proxies and we are in a
12:05
war of survival with them and they are
12:07
the root of the problem that we are
12:09
facing not just in in Gaza with Hamas
12:12
but with hisbah with the houthis in
12:14
Yemen with these milias in Iraq and
12:16
Syria Iran is behind all of these groups
12:18
these partners and proxies that they
12:20
have and they're willing to take the
12:22
risk despite the blowback that they
12:24
almost certainly know will happen once
12:26
they strike these Iranians in Syria they
12:29
willing to take it because they just
12:31
don't get opportunities like this very
12:35
often and they feel pretty confident
12:38
that they can take a step like this as
12:40
risky it is and audacious as it is
12:43
because they've seen it work
12:48
[Music]
12:53
before we'll be right back
12:59
[Music]
13:03
so Eric why were the Israelis so
13:05
confident that engaging with Iran in
13:07
this kind of risky way was something
13:09
they were willing to gamble on I mean it
13:12
resulted in this historic Iranian attack
13:14
so why risk something like that so the
13:17
Israelis had been involved in a shadow
13:19
war with Iran for years where each side
13:22
took shots at some of their senior
13:23
military people or other operatives but
13:26
it's always been kind of below the radar
13:28
if you will the Israeli strike on April
13:31
1st that precipitated this attack from
13:34
Iran was a clear departure from that
13:37
shadow war and I think one reason why
13:41
Israel had that change in approach was
13:44
because it was looking to a specific
13:46
American action against Iran as a kind
13:49
of a
13:52
model in January 2020 the United States
13:56
under President Trump made an EXT
13:59
extraordinary move he went after a guy
14:02
named Major General kasum
14:07
sulamani now sulamani at the time was
14:10
Iran's most powerful security and
14:12
intelligence
14:13
commander and he worked closely with
14:16
Iraqi and Lebanese allies he nurtured
14:19
proxy forces to form a kind of Shiite
14:22
axis of power throughout the whole
14:25
region medy in in Iran lauded him as a
14:28
hero somebody he was essentially
14:30
Untouchable to the west and he was
14:32
almost too big to kill however he'd also
14:36
been long designated as a terrorist by
14:38
the United States and because many of
14:40
his forces had been fighting against the
14:43
United States after the United States
14:45
invasion of Iraq so Trump orders a
14:48
strike to kill General sulamani he was
14:50
on a visit to Iraq and while he's at the
14:52
Baghdad airport they take him out and
14:55
it's just stunning I remember the strike
14:57
because it was you know everybody was
14:59
saying this is going to be the beginning
15:01
of the end I mean this guy is the most
15:03
important guy in many ways in Iran and
15:05
the United States just killed him yeah
15:08
yeah well Trump said he was plotting
15:11
imminent and Sinister attacks against
15:12
American interests that was his
15:14
reasoning after the strike but everybody
15:17
was just waiting to holding their breath
15:19
for what's going to happen next what
15:20
will be Iran's response to the death of
15:23
their top General and sure enough 5 days
15:27
later
15:29
Iran responded they launched more than a
15:32
dozen ballistic missiles at al-asad
15:35
Airbase a major American base in Western
15:38
Iraq where hundreds of US service
15:40
members are stationed the response was
15:43
important in Iran's view this a major
15:45
attack again using a very sophisticated
15:48
weapon against an American base in Iraq
15:51
more than 100 Americans suffered brain
15:53
injuries but no one was killed given
15:56
suman's position and the influence he
15:59
had over covert operations the Iranian
16:02
attack could have been much
16:03
[Music]
16:06
worse in fact the Iranians come out
16:09
looking kind of restrained in the
16:12
response Iran did not want a full-scale
16:15
war with the United States at this point
16:17
despite their public remarks despite the
16:20
loss of this revered General would push
16:23
came to shove at that point they did not
16:24
want to cross that line so what is the
16:28
lesson in the sumani example for what we
16:30
saw this past weekend Eric I mean is it
16:33
fair to say that perhaps the Israelis
16:35
were right in their assumptions you know
16:38
that what we saw in how Iran prosecuted
16:41
this attack on Saturday the advanced
16:42
warning the slow rollout the targeting
16:45
of remote bases rather than Urban
16:47
centers that all of this seems to have
16:49
been done to send a signal and that that
16:52
signal was that Iran is only willing to
16:55
go so
16:56
far yes they're essentially you know
16:59
maneuvering themselves to give them a
17:02
way out it's an offramp here by
17:04
basically saying okay look we're done
17:07
for these strikes for now this has been
17:09
a defensive measure that's how they're
17:10
calling it that's how they're casting it
17:13
and basically unless you israelies want
17:15
to ramp this thing up you know we're
17:17
done we're done for now and that seems
17:19
to be where Iran wants to leave it right
17:23
and so the ball is in Israel's court
17:25
right now as to what the response will
17:27
be next okay so what do we know about
17:31
what Israel is thinking what's going to
17:32
be Israel's response so that's the
17:35
question everyone is asking right now
17:37
Israel's closest and strongest Ally the
17:40
United States is pushing Israel to
17:42
basically stop here President Biden
17:45
spoke with prime minister Netanyahu and
17:47
told him hey you got everything you
17:50
wanted you killed the generals you
17:52
stabed off this massive Iranian attack
17:55
this basically could not have worked out
17:57
any better for you take the out the
17:59
Iranians are giving you and let this be
18:02
the end of it for now yeah look we came
18:05
to your Aid when you were in need we put
18:08
our planes and our Ships In Harm's Way
18:10
and help knock down these missiles and
18:12
drones but we will not help you
18:15
retaliate against Iran if that's the
18:17
decision you decide to make Eric this
18:20
strikes me as a pretty tricky moment for
18:23
President Biden right because you know
18:26
he's asking Netanyahu not to ESC at but
18:30
at the end of the day you know Netanyahu
18:32
has lots of constituencies he's dealing
18:34
with he's under lots of pressure and now
18:37
that Iran has attacked like this
18:40
directly it's going to be harder for
18:42
Biden to use his leverage against Israel
18:45
so I guess the next question then is
18:47
Will Netanyahu actually take the win as
18:49
the Americans are advising him to do
18:52
well and that's the open question you've
18:54
got in one year the Americans are
18:56
telling him stop take the win don't make
18:59
this any worse but in the other year
19:02
you've got the far-right cabinet members
19:04
saying you cannot let this stand you
19:07
know you you must strike aggressively
19:08
back you cannot do this and so what you
19:11
seem at least the early statements from
19:13
the Israelis are saying look we will
19:15
continue to defend ourselves and we will
19:18
respond at a time and place of our
19:21
choosing it's sort of international
19:23
speak for we're going to do something
19:25
but we're going to do it later that's
19:26
right and of course we're the the
19:28
hardliners in netanyahu's cabinet to win
19:31
out that of course would potentially
19:34
spark the regional war that we've long
19:36
been worrying about and have been
19:38
talking to you for a long time about
19:40
Eric that's right and of course that
19:42
would have multiple effects I mean think
19:45
about it just as there's this huge
19:46
debate before all this happened over the
19:49
Israeli operation in Rafa and Southern
19:51
Gaza now well Israel's ability already
19:55
is so difficult to do that but can you
19:57
imagine having to to and prosecute its
20:00
mission of dismantling the last
20:02
stronghold of Hamas and Gaza and having
20:04
to what fight some other kind of broader
20:07
second or third front at the same time
20:10
as a whole it would you know upset the
20:11
stability of the entire region this
20:13
happens and any escalation here would
20:16
open the door to a much wider Regional
20:19
War I gu the question is you know will
20:22
Israel bring us into one or will Iran
20:25
lose patience and and bring us into one
20:26
from that side yes in the United States
20:30
and Iran they're saying here is this the
20:32
line we're willing to walk up to and the
20:35
question is whether Israel is willing to
20:37
set that line or go
20:40
further you know you seem to have in
20:42
this case the Iranians and the Americans
20:45
in a weird way are kind of aligned in
20:47
this like enough enough already in the
20:49
Israelis everybody's kind of leaning
20:50
forward and saying okay now
20:53
what is this going to get
20:56
worse and that's what we just don't
20:58
don't know
21:04
yet Eric thank
21:07
you thank
21:19
you on Sunday the United Nation Security
21:23
Council held an emergency meeting at the
21:25
request of Israel with diplomats urg
21:28
restraint by all parties to prevent the
