Chuck Schumer on His Campaign to Oust Israelâ€™s Leader


0:01
from The New York Times I'm Michael borro this is the [Music]
0:11
daily today in a speech without precedent Senate Majority Leader Chuck
0:17
Schumer called for Israelis to hold an election and vote out their current
0:24
leader soon after my colleague Annie Carney sat down with Schumer to
0:30
understand why he did it it's Friday March
0:37
[Music]
0:43
13th and this Story begins with a speech so let's start there tell us about this
0:50
speech I Rise to speak today about what I believe can and should be the path
0:57
forward to secure Mutual peace and Lasting prosperity for Israelis and
1:05
Palestinians so last Thursday without much warning Chuck Schumer the Senate
1:10
Majority Leader took to the senate floor and started delivering what ended up being a really personal really meaty
1:17
speech about his Jewish identity and about Israel I speak for myself but I
1:23
also speak for so many mainstream Jewish Americans a silent majority whose
1:30
nuanced views on the matter have never been well represented in this country's
1:35
discussions about the war in Gaza so he starts by describing himself
1:41
and giving a sense of why he sees himself as a guardian of the people of Israel of course my first responsibility
1:48
is to America and to New York but as the first Jewish majority leader of the
1:55
United States Senate and the highest ranking Jewish elected official in America ever I also feel very keenly my
2:05
responsibility as a chare Israel a guardian of the people of Israel but he
2:13
quickly turns to the humanitarian catastrophy in Gaza and describes some
2:18
of the suffering and displacement there entire families wiped out whole neighborhoods reduced to Rubble Mass
2:26
displacement children suffering and he gets to his point that Israel has a moral obligation to do
2:33
better Palestinian civilians do not deserve to suffer for the sins of Hamas
2:38
and Israel has a moral obligation to do better the United States has an obligation to do better and that this is
2:46
not in line with Israel's values what's happening in Gaza what horrifies so many Jews especially is our sense that Israel
2:53
is falling short of upholding these distinctly Jewish values that we hold so
2:58
dear we we must be better than our enemies lest we become them that
3:04
Israel's approach to its war against tamas and Gaza is not in sync with what
3:10
he sees as the very meaning of being a Jew and what Israel is supposed to
3:16
represent that's right and he also kind of frames it as this is not only hurting
3:22
Palestinians but it's hurting Israel support for Israel has declined worldwide in the last few months and
3:28
this trend will only get worse if the Israeli government continues to follow
3:34
its current path he thinks that when they're Prosecuting the war in this fashion they are quickly losing Global
3:42
support American support their reputation on the world stage and he thinks that Israel's future is in
3:48
Jeopardy if it doesn't have public support from the rest of the world the existence of Israel he's saying is in
3:56
Jeopardy yes we cannot let anger or trauma determine our actions or Cloud our
4:04
judgment so Schumer in the speech carefully lays out that he thinks the only path out of this is a peace deal he
4:12
specifically says they need to work towards a two-state solution the only real and sustainable solution to this
4:19
decades old conflict is a negotiated two-state solution a demilitarized
4:25
Palestinian State living side by side with Israel in equal measures of Peace
4:30
security Prosperity dignity and mutual recognition and then he goes through
4:36
four obstacles to such a peace deal right now there are four four major obstacles standing in the way of two
4:42
states and until they are removed from the equation there will never be peace in Israel and Gaza and the West Bank the
4:51
four major obstacles are Hamas and the Palestinians who support and tolerate
4:57
their evil ways radical right-wing Israelis in government and Society the most shocking
5:04
one that he lists Palestinian Authority president mmud abas is Israeli Prime
5:11
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel I
5:16
will explain each in detail the first major obstacle and what specifically does Schumer point to about Netanyahu
5:24
prime minister Netanyahu has lost his way by allowing his political survival
5:30
to take the precedence over the best interests of Israel he has filled his
5:37
government with far-right extremists that Schumer called out by name in the speech he has put himself in Coalition
5:44
with far-right extremists like Minister smotri and Ben gavier and as a result he has been too willing to tolerate the
5:51
civilian toll in Gaza which is pushing support for Israel worldwide to Historic
5:57
lows Israel cannot survive if it becomes a pariah and
6:03
Netanyahu has ruled out what Schumer is saying is the answer which is a two-state solution and he has shown zero
6:10
interest in doing the courageous and Visionary work required to pave the way for
6:16
peace even before this present conflict the way he's carrying out this war even
6:21
the Biden Administration has criticized him for not doing more to mitigate civilian deaths he won't commit to a
6:27
military operation in Rafa that prioritizes protecting civilian life he
6:33
won't engage responsibly in discussions about a day after plan for Gaza and a
6:38
longer term Pathway to peace and Schumer's view the Netanyahu Coalition
6:44
no longer fits the needs of Israel after October 7th he is stuck in the past
6:51
nobody expects prime minister Netanyahu to do the things that must be done to break the cycle of violence to preserve
6:58
Israel's credibility on the world stage and to work towards a two-state solution
7:04
and can't do the things Min necessary to move Israel into the Future Past this
7:10
War 5 months into this conflict it is clear that Israelis need to take stock
7:16
of the situation and ask must we change course then he gets to what becomes that
7:23
real big headline of this speech and makes it kind of the bombshell moment in
7:28
US Israel relations that it became I believe a new election is the only way
7:35
to allow for a healthy and open decisionmaking process about the future of Israel he says that as the War Winds
7:42
down Israel should have a new election and he makes it clear that he
7:48
thinks Netanyahu should be removed from Power I also believe a majority of the
7:53
Israeli public will recognize the need for change and I believe that holding a new election one once the war starts to
8:00
wind down would give Israelis an opportunity to express their vision for
8:06
the post-war future the reason he is saying this now is because Israel doesn't have to hold an election until
8:13
2026 two years from now yes that's a lot of time for Netanyahu to stay in power
8:20
and according to Schumer watch Israel's reputation abroad ER Roe so what
8:27
Schumer's saying is hold that election much sooner as soon as this war is over
8:32
and get rid of Netanyahu so Israel can correct course I mean everything about
8:38
that is highly unconventional it's unprecedented and
8:44
this is why Schumer is really careful with his language in this section of the speech of course the United States
8:49
cannot dictate the outcome of an of an election nor should we try that is for
8:56
the Israeli public to decide making it clear that Israeli voters will decide
9:02
he's not trying to decide for them if prime minister netanyahu's current Coalition remains in power after the war
9:08
begins to wind down but then later in the speech he also makes it clear that if Netanyahu stays in power the us will
9:15
have no choice but to take additional measures to push back on him then the
9:20
United States will have no choice but to play a more active role in shaping Israeli policy by using our leverage to
9:28
change the course and he is not specific about what those are but makes clear
9:34
that there will be more push back from America if Netanyahu stays the United
9:39
States bond with Israel is unbreakable but if extremists continue to unduly influence Israeli policy then the
9:47
administration should use the tools at its disposal to make sure our support for Israel is aligned with our broader
9:53
goal of achieving long-term peace and stability in the region right and I was
9:58
listening to this section of the speech and he he uses the word tools and it
10:04
definitely felt to me and I wonder how you heard it that the word tools meant money American Aid to Israel almost
10:12
certainly the US sends several billion dollars of military aid to Israel every year that is underpinning this war in
10:19
Gaza Schumer is critical to moving that Aid through Congress and this is him
10:25
sort of saying that not explicitly he doesn't say money he says tools but that
10:30
they have a lot of Leverage over Israel and this is also what makes the speech
10:35
so remarkable in the first place because Schumer is calling for these new elections and then following it up by
10:42
saying we have other tools if this continues in the direction it's going right now From the Ashes may we light
10:50
the candles that lead to a better future for
10:55
all right and what did feel so historic about this speech I think to so many of us is that Schumer is saying so many
11:04
quiet things out loud the first being that the US sees BB Netanyahu as a
11:11
problem that needs to be removed big enough saying that and on top of that he
11:17
says we are willing and ready if we need to to essentially turn off the US
11:23
Financial spigot to Israel if the Netanyahu government doesn't leave or
11:30
significantly change and both of those just cannot be overstated for their enormity and their unprecedented it was
11:38
a huge historic risky speech that Chuck Schumer made I mean I think this was
11:43
probably one of the riskiest moments of his career that he is putting himself
11:48
out there to make this call and ramp up this pressure on
11:54
[Music] Netanyahu people of Israel
12:00
at home and in captivity deserve America's support
12:06
immediately after Schumer leaves the floor Mitch McConnell the minority leader takes to the podium and blasts
12:15
the speech it is grotesque and hypocritical for Americans who
12:21
hyperventilate about foreign interference in our own democracy to call for the removal of a
12:28
democratically elected leader of Israel Republicans try immediately to say we
12:34
need to be standing with Israel and we need to give our friends and allies our full support Democrats aren't being
12:42
anti-b they're being anti-israel Shu Schumer speech was an act of Courage an
12:47
act of love for Israel Democratic responses mixed some said he did a great
12:53
job he he did something Brave and others I've got full faith and confidence in
12:58
the Israeli people to make the right determination about what their future should look like and said he crossed a
13:04
line and this was inappropriate President Biden was brief in responding but he called it a good
13:12
speech I'm not going to exact elaborate on a speech he made a good speech and I
13:18
think he uh expressed a serious concern shared not only by him but by many
13:24
Americans many people interpreted that as the administration thinking that SCH
13:30
speaking out was helpful to their aims and then there's Trump because he was always pro-israel he's very anti-israel
13:37
now who called any Jew who votes for Democrats to be self-hating and hate
13:43
Israel any Jewish person that votes for Democrats uh hates their religion they
13:50
hate everything about Israel and they should be ashamed of themselves and finally on Sunday Netanyahu made the
13:58
rounds on some of the Sunday shows here I think Schumer's statements are wholly inappropriate I think when we're not a
14:04
Banana Republic the people of Israel will choose when they'll have elections who they elect and it's not something
14:09
that will be foed upon us and in fact he continues to say we're going to invade Rafa we're going to keep up the
14:15
aggression in Gaza so clearly he doesn't feel the need to react in terms of his
14:21
policies to the speech in anyway but we have to finish the job we need total Victory there's no substitute for total
14:28
victory [Music]
14:37
netanyahu's message to Schumer basically is go fly a kite I don't care what you say to me I am not changing a thing
14:44
about my approach to this war that's right this is a watershed moment for
14:50
Schumer and a turning point in the US relationship to Israel in the middle of
14:56
this war and in part because the reaction to the speech was all over the place I was left with a lot of questions
15:04
about why Schumer decided to do this in the first place and that's how I ended up sitting with him in Brooklyn on
15:11
Sunday afternoon to ask him why did you give this speech what were you hoping it
15:17
would do who is it for and how does it fit in with your long-standing relationship with Israel and with your
15:24
own Jewish faith
15:32
we'll be right [Music]
15:41
back so Annie tell us about this interview you end up having with Schumer in Brooklyn so we end up meeting at
15:49
James Madison High School in Midwood Brooklyn nice to see you thank you you
15:55
want me to sign great thank you we walk in together and he has to sign in at the front desk
16:02
right this is his Alma Moder a few blocks away from the house he grew up in in the 1950s and 60s what a moment to
16:09
come back here yeah to Where it All Began sort of see I guess that's the
16:17
Golden Nights it was a heavily Jewish neighborhood at the time
16:22
mhm okay now we can go this is the library okay so as we're walking around
16:28
the school he's reminding me of what it was like to grow up in this neighborhood was right right after World War II and
16:35
America was advancing and so as a Jew in the shadow of the Holocaust recent
16:40
memory recent memory there were ladies on my block who would show you the numbers on their arms from the camps and
16:48
I remember that was a very present reality for him and yet at the same time for the Jewish people for me so much
16:55
part of my existence Israel was there well out of the holoc came Israel and we
17:00
were so proud of Israel and he talked about how exciting and enamored he was
17:07
with the creation of a Jewish state that came out of the Holocaust in the Holocaust Jewish people
17:14
we didn't fight back enough and here is Israel fighting to create a Homeland
17:19
against overwhelming odds but Israel in 1967 when Israel was fighting a war with
17:28
Arab Neighbors was nearly wiped off the map he was very invested you know when I walked around the halls of this High
17:34
School Madison High School in 1967 I was walking with the transistor radio it's June we're ready to graduate
17:41
attached to my ear cuz I thought Israel would be pushed into the sea that's the connection it's long before politics
17:47
this was part of his identity in these formative high school years right the story he's telling which is familiar to
17:53
many American Jews is of growing up at a time when the Holocaust is still casting
17:59
a very long Shadow and Israel is such a potent symbol of Jewish survival and
18:05
strength and for somebody like Schumer the very idea of Israel its very
18:11
existence tugs at their heart they don't live there but it is a source of extraordinary inspiration that's right
18:19
absolutely and by the time he gets into politics in the late 70s and early
18:24
80s he's also very aware of the fact that Israel is a bipartisan issue Democrats
18:32
and Republicans alike steadfastly support Israel they're committed to the close relationship and giving Aid and Military
18:40
Support to Israel and he is really proud of the fact that he said whenever I
18:45
carried legislation for Israel I always had a republican that was a CREDO and
18:51
that he thinks is key to Israel's success that it's bipartisan right so
18:56
how do I know BB I know him for a long time right it's around this time that he first crossed his path with BB Netanyahu
19:04
he had gone to Harvard with BB's brother who was an Israeli War hero who died in
19:09
combat and became a huge National figure they didn't know each other personally but he said that kind of helped Foster a
19:16
connection with BB and you know in the beginning BB did a lot of good things
19:21
for Israel he was the economic Minister and created almost an economic Miracle we
19:27
were so proud that Israel was doing startups and Tech and all these things and when he first became prime minister
19:33
he was fine he look he was to the right but not far right and when Netanyahu
19:39
becomes prime minister he wanted to back him his gut was to stay with him and
19:44
back n who even as other Democrats thought he was moving too far to the right right and BB's right word drift
19:50
becomes extremely pronounced so much so that he opposes President Obama's plan
19:57
to make peace with Iran through a nuclear deal and Netanyahu actually travels to the US Congress to give a
20:04
speech asking Congress asking someone like Schumer to reject that nuclear deal
20:11
exactly and Schumer at the time was the rare Democrat who broke with Obama over
20:18
the Iran deal you sided with Netanyahu against Obama yes and I talked to Netanyahu quite a lot he must have been
20:24
thrilled with that vote he was but and said it was a matter of just to protect Israel and he voted against that
20:32
deal I mean suffice it to say for a very long time Chuck Schumer is a supporter
20:40
of BB Netanyahu so much so that he's even willing to break with his own
20:45
Democratic president because he agrees with Netanyahu that policies like the
20:51
Iran nuclear deal are bad for Israel yes I'd say that maybe he had some
20:57
criticisms but Chuck Schumer was netanyahu's best hope in terms of
21:03
Democratic Leadership in the United States but somehow BB drifted way to the
21:08
right and one of the turning points was when he just embraced Trump so completely and I'll tell for Schumer his
21:15
views on BB start to change when Donald Trump is elected here and Netanyahu
21:20
becomes extremely close with him and starts to pursue policies that Democrats see as not at all in keeping with their
21:27
values mhm so BB together with Trump pursues diplomatic deals between Israel
21:34
and its Arab neighbors that do not take into account the future of Palestinians his government expands
21:40
settlements with Trump's support and basically what this means is that Israel is taking the land that would be
21:46
essential to creating a two-state peace deal in the future right and all of this infuriates Democrats who think these
21:52
policies are making a two-state solution impossible and taking away the Leverage The palestin might have had he has now
22:00
become so interested in self-preservation that he does also faces corruption investigations which
22:06
forc him to bring very right-wing politicians into his government right and Schumer told me that he thinks he
22:13
never would have made these alliances 10 years ago so really what happens during the Trump years in Schumer's mind is
22:20
that BB just gives up on Democrats and what they want for Israel and the Palestinians and just wants to be
22:26
aligned with Trump I'll tell you in a meeting I had he comes in to see me it's
22:32
about 2018 2019 and I said BB I agree with you the
22:38
greatest short-term threat to Israel is the Rockets Iran gives his Bala and they put them in Lebanon and shoot them at
22:45
Israel but the greatest middle and long-term danger is you lose America
22:50
particularly the half of America that's more Progressive Andor the half of America that's young and by your
22:56
embracing Trump you are making that happen that was so in his mind BB
23:04
chooses Republicans and walks away from this history of bipartisan support
23:11
that's right and that becomes even more of a problem after October 7th well just explain that Annie well after October
23:18
7th there's broad support for Israel who was just the victim of a terrorist attack against defenseless
23:25
citizens but as the war continues and and the Netanyahu regime starts to take
23:32
these aggressive actions in Gaza that support starts to dwindle States because I look at the numbers and they're
23:37
rapidly decreasing terms when you ask people do you support Israel or Palestinians it's getting all too
23:43
close and in his mind you know his fear that Israel will lose the support of
23:51
America seems to be playing out in a really acute way he can see it in his
23:56
party um who's really divided over what's happening in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there I am worried
24:04
if Israel loses support from America it's going to be it's its future could well be over I want and his fear what he
24:12
fears is that there could come a Tipping Point when the majority of this country
24:19
does not support Israel and it's alone in a hostile Middle East without the
24:25
necessary Financial backing from the United States so as the highest elected Jewish official in America and one of
24:31
the leading Jewish whatever you want people in America I felt an obligation to do this this was not political and
24:39
this is why he says he ultimately sat down to write this speech this is so
24:45
part of my core my soul my in yish my Mana by the way in his mind the goal
24:52
here is to try to save Israel from bib's actions which he thinks imp Peril it's
24:59
future once Schumer decides to write this speech Annie and to encourage
25:04
Israelis to hold an election and in that election vote out Netanyahu I'm curious
25:10
how does Schumer tell you he thinks about the precedent that that SS that
25:16
the US will try to influence a foreign country's decision about who should lead
25:23
it I asked him about that and he said he was aware that this section of the
25:29
speech was the most delicate line he had to tell no did you consider I thought it was in did you consider not
25:35
personalizing it with Netanyahu and just calling for policy changes I didn't think that would be enough and he's the
25:40
found to the prop to just call for policy changes I thought it wouldn't pierce it wouldn't do anything it wouldn't do anything it forget yes it's
25:47
so urgent and so important I didn't think it was appropriate to call for him to step down but I thought the next step
25:53
thing over and say why I think he's a bad leader and did you think so he wasting this speech with the notion of
26:01
being careful about appearing to interfere front of mind and he thought
26:07
where he landed going further than simply calling for policy changes but stopping short of calling for a
26:12
resignation and calling for new elections he thinks he towed the line and didn't cross it got it now clearly
26:19
many people including Netanyahu disagree about whether Schumer crossed the line but I'm curious if those people were his
26:27
a a I mean who is Schumer really talking to with this speech does he think he's
26:34
speaking directly to Israelis and asking them to demand a new election and that
26:40
they're going to listen or actually is he really talking to a more domestic
26:45
audience in particular his fellow Democrats who are increasingly upset
26:50
about this war and potentially it looks like willing to hold it against their
26:55
party's leaders he put this pretty simply when I asked
27:01
him it's tended for all people who love Israel and feel so conflicted by what's going on now the purpose of the speech
27:09
is to say you can still love Israel and feel strongly about Israel and totally disagree with BB Netanyahu and the
27:16
policies of Israel right he said that it was aimed above all at American Jews and
27:22
non-jews who love Israel and he wanted what he wanted to do here was separate Netanyahu from Israel and make it
27:30
crystal clear to people that you can be anti Netanyahu you can totally disagree
27:35
with how he's conducting the war in Gaza and you can still be as pro- Israel as ever he wanted to create this separation
27:43
between Netanyahu and Israel and make Jews and non-jews alike feel like it's
27:48
still okay to be pro-israel this feels kind of important so I want to linger on it for a second Andy Schumer's telling
27:54
you that what he's really trying to do is give Americans a kind of new
28:01
structure and vocabulary for thinking about Israel in this moment and that
28:07
structure in vocabulary is there's an Israel separate from Netanyahu and so if
28:13
you're angry at Israel in this moment you should really be angry at Netanyahu
28:19
not Israel that's right he's asking them to blame BB not Israel that Israel is
28:24
better than this is better than BBE and to see it that way it's almost the same way that people who
28:31
love America but hate Donald Trump would have felt during the Trump Administration that they still believe
28:38
in this country but they don't believe in Trump that feels like a very
28:43
complicated request that Schumer is making because the reality is that Israelis have repeatedly made BB
28:50
Netanyahu their leader so much so that if you're an American especially a
28:56
younger American and Schumer wants those younger Americans to separate BB from Israel that would be pretty hard to
29:02
accomplish because he's been leader of Israel for as long as some of these Young Americans have been alive so how
29:09
is Schumer thinking about whether what he's asking for is really possible I
29:14
mean yes it's a little bit of wishful thinking like it's true that a lot of Americans don't really know the Israel
29:21
of Schumer's childhood that he's able to remember but they are not he's doing this in the middle of a six month long
29:28
War where people are just horrified by the conditions in Gaza and the Israeli
29:37
government is the one that is carrying on this offensive but a lot of Jews a
29:42
lot of American Jews are really conflicted because at the same time they understand that Israel has a right to
29:49
defend itself against Hamas and I think that Schumer is trying to give voice to
29:55
these conflicted maybe middle of the road politically American Jews who don't know
30:01
what to think about Israel right now and do probably love Israel the way he does
30:08
but also feel awful about the images they're seeing from Gaza so this call
30:13
from Schumer for a new leader of Israel is kind of his way of resolving that internal conflict that people are
30:19
feeling but of course it's not clear if that election will be called and even if
30:25
it were called it's not clear whether Israelis would elect a new leader so I
30:31
guess my question is what then Schumer's speech does mention these other tools
30:38
that the US has at its disposal when would Schumer be willing to use those
30:44
tools yeah I asked him about the question of what then line you don't want to seize fire but like what is
30:52
there like 30,000 more Palestinians dead well I wouldn't I I'd say look isra no I have to I just I said you know what's
31:00
your red line should be what is the civilian death toll that would have to
31:07
be reached for you to say we're pulling this funding you said in your speech if
31:13
something doesn't change then there's the threat of American rich I didn't I didn't say conditions and I didn't say
31:20
um leverage I just said America's going to look at it as a thing and you didn't say exactly what no because they didn't
31:26
want to you didn't want to but what would the scenario be where that would well I you'd have to see it I don't I
31:32
couldn't speculate on the future and he didn't want to say Well then why even give the speech
31:40
if Schumer is not willing to talk about the real consequences for Israel if
31:46
there are no elections and if Israelis don't end up removing Netanyahu from
31:52
