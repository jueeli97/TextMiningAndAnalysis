A Terrorist Attack in Russia



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
Tavern and this is the
0:06
[Music]
0:11
daily a terrorist attack on a concert
0:14
hall near Moscow Friday night killed
0:16
more than 100 people and injured scores
0:19
more it was the deadliest attack in
0:21
Russia in
0:23
decades today my colleague Anton trosi
0:27
on the uncomfortable question it raises
0:30
for Russia's President Vladimir Putin
0:32
has his focus on the war in Ukraine left
0:35
his country more vulnerable to other
0:42
threats it's Monday March
0:46
[Music]
0:52
25th so Anton tell us about this
0:54
horrific attack in Russia when did you
0:57
first hear about it so it was Friday
1:00
night around 8:30 Moscow time that we
1:05
started seeing reports about a terrorist
1:09
attack at a concert hall just outside
1:13
Moscow I frankly wasn't sure right at
1:16
the beginning how serious this was
1:19
because we have seen quite a lot of
1:21
attacks inside Russia over the last 2
1:24
years since the full-scale invasion of
1:26
Ukraine and it was hard to make sense of
1:29
right away
1:30
but then within a few hours it was
1:33
really looking like we were seeing the
1:36
worst terrorist attack in or around the
1:40
Russian capital in more than 20
1:46
years on Friday night croca City Hall
1:50
was the venue for a concert by a oldtime
1:54
Russian rock group called picnic it was
1:57
a soldout show thousands of people
1:59
people were expected to be there and
2:03
before the start of the concert it
2:06
appears that four gunmen in camouflage
2:10
walked into the
2:14
venue and started
2:18
shooting we started seeing videos on
2:22
social media just incredibly awful
2:25
graphic footage of these men shooting
2:29
concert goers at Point Blank
2:32
Range in one of the videos we see one of
2:35
them slitting the throat of one of the
2:38
concert
2:40
goers and then what appears to have
2:43
happened is that they set the concert
2:46
hall on fire Russian investigators said
2:48
they had some kind of flammable liquid
2:51
that they lit on fire and basically
2:53
tried to burn down this huge concert
2:56
hall with Wounded people in it some of
2:59
these people
3:00
ended up trapped as the building
3:07
burned as eventually the roof of this
3:11
concert hall collapsed and it seems as
3:14
though much of the casualties actually
3:16
came as a result of the fire as opposed
3:19
to as a result of the
3:21
[Music]
3:24
shooting the actual attack it looks like
3:27
didn't take more than 15 to 30 minutes
3:30
at which point the four men were able to
3:33
escape they got into a white Renault
3:37
sedan and fled the
3:39
[Music]
3:41
scene it took the authorities clearly a
3:45
while to arrive the attackers were able
3:47
to spread this horrific violence for as
3:51
I said at least 15 minutes or so so
3:54
among other things there's a lot of
3:55
questions being raised right now about
3:57
why the official resp bonds took so
4:05
[Music]
4:10
long and you said the perpetrators Got
4:13
Away what happened next so it looks like
4:18
they were caught at some point hours
4:20
after the attack on Saturday morning the
4:23
Kremlin said that 11 people had been
4:27
arrested in connection to the attack
4:30
including all four perpetrators they
4:34
were taken into custody according to the
4:36
Russian authorities in the bransk region
4:39
of Russia roughly a 5-hour drive from
4:42
the concert hall in Southwestern Russia
4:45
also pretty close to the border with
4:48
Ukraine obviously we have to take
4:51
everything that the Russian authorities
4:53
are saying with a grain of salt and as
4:56
we've been reporting on this throughout
4:58
the weekend we have very much tried to
5:01
verify all the claims that the Russian
5:04
authorities are making independently and
5:07
so our colleagues in the visual
5:09
investigations unit of the times have
5:11
been working very hard on that and what
5:14
we can say based on the footage of the
5:19
attack that was taken by many different
5:22
individuals and posted to social media
5:24
it very much looks like the four men who
5:28
were detained who Russia says
5:30
were the attackers in fact are the same
5:34
people who are seen doing the shooting
5:37
in those videos of the attack judging by
5:40
their clothes judging by their hairstyle
5:42
judging by their build and and other
5:44
identifying characteristics that our
5:46
colleagues have been looking at so it
5:49
does appear that by Saturday morning The
5:53
Men Who directly carried out this attack
5:57
had been taken into custody wow so the
6:00
Russian government actually apprehended
6:03
the perpetrators according to our
6:05
reporting work that our colleagues have
6:06
done so who are these guys we don't know
6:10
much about them the Russian government
6:12
says that none of them are Russian
6:15
citizens after the arrest throughout the
6:18
weekend videos short clips of
6:23
interrogations of these men have been
6:25
popping up on the telegram social
6:28
network clearly leaked or provided by
6:32
Russian law enforcement you see these
6:34
men blooded hurt and is this Russian
6:39
interrogators abusing them yes that is
6:42
very much what it looks like and it's
6:43
also notable that the Russian
6:45
authorities aren't even hiding it two of
6:49
the suspects in those videos are heard
6:52
speaking tajic so that's the language
6:55
spoken in Tajikistan a Central Asian
6:58
country but also in some of the
7:00
surrounding countries including
7:02
Afghanistan at the end of the day this
7:04
is still a very much developing
7:06
situation and there's a ton that we
7:09
don't know but hours after the attack
7:12
the Islamic State Isis took
7:15
responsibility and uh they then really
7:18
tried to emphasize this by even
7:19
releasing a video on Saturday showing
7:23
the attack taking place as it was filmed
7:25
apparently by one of the attackers and
7:28
US intelligence official have told our
7:30
colleagues in Washington that they
7:32
indeed believe this to be true that they
7:35
believe that this Isis offshoot did
7:38
carry out this attack wow so the
7:42
Americans actually think that Isis the
7:45
extremist group that we know so well
7:46
from Iraq and Syria carried out this
7:48
attack yes and all of this is really
7:51
remarkable because just a few weeks ago
7:54
on March 7th the United States actually
7:57
warned publicly that something just like
8:01
this could happen the US Embassy in
8:04
Moscow issued a security alert urging US
8:09
citizens to avoid large Gatherings over
8:11
the next 48 hours they said that the
8:14
embassy is monitoring reports that
8:16
extremists have imminent plans to Target
8:19
large gatherings in Moscow to include
8:22
concerts crazy that is a very specific
8:26
warning absolutely and of course the the
8:29
statement mentioned that specific 48h
8:32
hour time frame but nevertheless it
8:35
feels really significant and did the
8:37
Russian authorities respond to that they
8:39
did and frankly they responded mostly by
8:43
ridiculing it this is all obviously
8:46
happening against the backdrop of the
8:48
worst conflict between Moscow and the
8:52
West since the depths of the Cold War
8:55
and so Vladimir Putin actually publicly
9:00
dismissed this warning he called it
9:03
blackmail in a speech that he gave just
9:07
3 days before the attack last Tuesday so
9:11
despite the specificity publicly at
9:13
least the Russian authorities did not
9:15
take it seriously that is remarkable and
9:19
so three days later this huge attack
9:23
happens where is Putin in all of this
9:26
and who is he blaming what's his version
9:28
of events so he's coming off this
9:32
Russian election season as you know
9:34
where he declared this very stag managed
9:37
Victory and after that had been taking a
9:40
Victory lap of sorts but Putin doesn't
9:43
appear on camera until around 19 hours
9:49
after the attack at that point Russian
9:51
State television airs a five minute
9:54
speech by
9:58
Putin
10:00
he's sitting at this nondescript desk
10:03
surrounded by two Russian Flags but it's
10:05
not clear where he is located at that
10:08
point it doesn't look like he's at the
10:10
Kremlin and Anton what does he
10:17
say so he describes the horror of this
10:21
attack he declares Sunday a national day
10:25
of mourning he says the most important
10:28
thing is
10:29
to make sure that the people who did
10:32
this aren't able to carry out more
10:39
violence he also says that the four men
10:42
who carried out the attack were captured
10:45
as they were moving toward Ukraine and
10:48
he claims that based on preliminary
10:51
information as he put it there were
10:53
people on the Ukrainian side who were
10:55
going to help these men cross the border
10:59
safely and remember this is an extremely
11:02
dangerous militarized border given that
11:04
Russia and Ukraine have been in a state
11:06
of fullscale War right for over two
11:09
years
11:18
now and as he ends the speech he says
11:21
that Russia will punish the perpetrators
11:23
whoever they may be whoever may have
11:25
sent
11:28
them
11:33
[Music]
11:37
so what's important about all that is is
11:39
first of all that Putin did not mention
11:42
the apparent Islamic extremist
11:46
connection here that Western officials
11:49
have been talking about and that is in
11:51
front of all of us given that Islamic
11:54
state has claimed responsibility for the
11:57
attack but he does set the stage for
12:01
blaming Ukraine for this horrific
12:04
tragedy even though it seems that Putin
12:07
and the Russian government may be alone
12:08
in thinking
12:15
[Music]
12:22
that we'll be right
12:25
[Music]
12:28
back
12:36
so Anton the Islamic state has claimed
12:39
responsibility for this attack but Putin
12:41
ignores that and kind of obliquely
12:43
points the finger at
12:45
Ukraine what do we actually know about
12:48
who did this well let's start with the
12:50
group that claimed responsibility for
12:52
this attack that's Isis the Islamic
12:55
State and in particular us officials are
12:58
talking
13:00
about a branch of Isis called Isis K or
13:05
Islamic State corasan which is an
13:08
Islamic State affiliate that's primarily
13:10
active in
13:12
Afghanistan and that in recent years has
13:15
gained this reputation for extreme
13:17
brutality they might be best known in
13:20
the US for being the group behind the
13:22
Cabell airport bombing back in
13:25
2021 after the Taliban took over when
13:27
thousands of Afghans were trying to
13:29
escape that was a bombing that killed 13
13:32
American troops and 171 civilians and it
13:35
really raised Isis K's profile so this
13:39
terrorist group is mainly based in
13:41
Afghanistan what do they want with
13:43
Russia so what's notable is our
13:46
colleague Eric Schmidt in Washington
13:48
talked to an expert over the weekend who
13:49
said Isis K has really developed an
13:52
obsession with Russia and Putin over the
13:56
last two years they say Russia has
13:59
Muslim blood on its hands so it looks
14:02
like the primary driver in this enmity
14:06
against Russia is Russia's alliance with
14:08
Bashar al-assad the Syrian president who
14:11
is also a sworn enemy of Isis and Russia
14:15
intervened of course on Assad's behalf
14:17
in the Syrian Civil War starting back in
14:20
2015 but it's not just Syria so the
14:23
experts we've talked to say that in the
14:25
Isis K propaganda you also hear about
14:29
R's wars in the southern region of
14:31
chetna in the 1990s and the early 2000s
14:34
and also even about the Soviet Union's
14:36
war in Afghanistan throughout the 1980s
14:40
there's this really long Arc of Russia's
14:43
and the Soviet Union's Wars in Muslim
14:47
regions that appears to be driving this
14:51
violent hatred of Russia on the part of
14:54
Isis K okay so Isis K is pointing not
14:57
only to Russia's actions in Syria but
15:00
actually further back into Russian
15:01
history even Soviet history to its war
15:04
in cha and then to the Soviets war in
15:06
Afghanistan yet Putin in his speech
15:09
ignores the group entirely and instead
15:11
points in the direction of Ukraine is
15:15
there a chance that this attack could
15:16
have been carried out by
15:18
Ukraine well look it is true that
15:21
Ukraine has carried out attacks inside
15:25
Russia that put Russian civilians at
15:28
risk there have been several bombings
15:31
that American officials have ascribed to
15:35
parts of the Ukrainian government
15:37
perhaps most famously there was the
15:40
bombing that killed Daria dugana uh the
15:43
daughter of a leading Russian Ultra
15:46
nationalist back in the summer of
15:48
2022 that was a bombing that happened
15:51
just outside Moscow and of course there
15:53
have been various drone strikes by
15:55
Ukraine against things like Russian
15:57
energy infrastructure even just in the
16:00
last few weeks but we really don't see
16:04
any evidence right now of any connection
16:09
of the Ukrainian state to this attack us
16:13
officials tell us they don't see
16:15
anything and we haven't in our own
16:17
reporting come across such a connection
16:20
either and there is of course the
16:22
context of the US has said very clearly
16:26
that they don't want to see Ukraine UK
16:29
carrying out big attacks inside Russia
16:32
American officials have said that doing
16:34
so is
16:36
counterproductive could lead to the risk
16:39
of Greater escalation by Putin in his
16:42
war and we're in an extremely sensitive
16:45
time right now when it comes to us
16:48
support for Ukraine right the US of
16:50
course has given all these weapons tens
16:52
of billions of dollars in Aid to Ukraine
16:55
but right now $60 billion in Aid are
16:58
stuck in US Congress and you would think
17:02
that Ukraine wouldn't want to do
17:03
anything right now that could risk that
17:05
that could risk that exactly I mean Also
17:08
let's just say I mean this was an
17:10
incredibly horrific attack and we
17:14
haven't seen anything from Ukraine and
17:17
the way they've carried themselves in
17:19
defending against Russia in this war
17:21
that would make us think they would be
17:23
capable of doing something like this
17:25
Anton just to step back for a moment I
17:27
mean it's interesting you know because
17:29
this attack it really doesn't remotely
17:32
fit into Putin's Obsession about where
17:36
the threat is coming from in the world
17:38
to Russia right his obsession is Ukraine
17:41
and this kind of short circuits that
17:44
absolutely I mean Russia has had a real
17:47
Islamic extremism problem for decades
17:50
going back to the 1990s to those brutal
17:54
Wars against Chetan separatists that
17:56
were a big part of Putin coming to power
17:59
and developing his strongman image so
18:02
it's really remarkable how we've arrived
18:03
at this Turning Point here for Putin
18:05
where he used to be someone who really
18:08
portrayed himself as the man keeping
18:10
Russians safe from terrorism now the
18:15
threat of terrorism coming from Islamic
18:18
extremists doesn't really fit into that
18:21
narrative that Putin has because now
18:23
Putin's narrative is all about the
18:25
threat from Ukraine and the west and
18:27
that the most important thing to do now
18:30
for Russian national security is to win
18:32
the war against Ukraine and does a
18:35
security failure here have anything to
18:37
do with Russia actually being obsessed
18:38
with Ukraine like it's kind of taken its
18:40
Eye Off the Ball well look the Russian
18:43
domestic intelligence agency the FSB
18:47
they're the ones who are supposed to
18:50
keep the country safe from terrorism but
18:52
that has also been the agency that has
18:55
been charged with asserting control over
19:01
the territories in Ukraine that Putin
19:03
has occupied and the FSB has been
19:06
spending all this time hunting down
19:08
dissidents of Putin right just a few
19:10
hours before the attack on Friday Russia
19:14
officially classified the so-called LGBT
19:19
movement as they put it on their list of
19:22
terrorists and extremists so terrorists
19:25
in the current Putin narrative are and
19:28
anyone who disagrees with him who
19:30
criticizes the War and who doesn't fit
19:33
into the kremlin's conception of
19:35
so-called Traditional Values which has
19:37
become such a big Putin talking point so
19:40
the FSB has been pretty busy but not in
19:42
terms of Islamic terrorism in terms of
19:43
its own people exactly we don't know for
19:46
sure obviously how the FSB is
19:49
apportioning its resources but there's a
19:52
lot of reason to believe that as the
19:55
leadership of that organization has been
19:57
looking at Putin's priorities in Ukraine
20:00
and in terms of cracking down on descent
20:03
domestically they could well have lost
20:06
sight of the risks of actual terrorism
20:10
inside Russia which is pretty remarkable
20:13
right Anton because you and I know and
20:14
we've spoken a lot about on the show a
20:17
big part of the reason that Putin
20:19
actually appeals is argument to Russians
20:22
is that he's the security guy you know
20:24
think what you will about him he's the
20:26
guy who's fundamentally going to keep
20:28
you safe
20:29
and here we have this attack that's
20:31
right and so he needs to continue making
20:34
the case that he knows how to keep
20:37
Russia safe and that's why my colleagues
20:40
and I have been watching a lot of
20:41
Russian State TV this weekend and this
20:43
Isis claim of responsibility barely
20:46
comes up and when it does come up it's
20:48
often being referred to as fake news
20:51
instead Russian propaganda is already
20:54
assuming that it was Ukraine and the
20:57
West that did this we'll see if the
21:01
Russian public buys that but if you look
21:03
at the way the last two years have gone
21:05
in Russia I think you have to draw the
21:07
conclusion that Russian propaganda is
21:09
extremely powerful and I think if this
21:12
message continues it's quite likely that
21:15
very many Russians will believe that
21:18
Ukraine and the West had something to do
21:22
with this
21:27
attack and so the worry now as we look
21:30
ahead is that Putin could end up using
21:34
this to try to escalate his War even
21:37
further which shows us why this is such
21:39
a tenuous and perilous moment because at
21:42
the same time this attack reminds us
21:45
that Russia faces other security risks
21:48
and as Putin deepens that conflict with
21:51
the West he may be doing so at the cost
21:54
of introducing even more
21:57
instability in inside the
22:03
country Anton thank you thank you

[Music]
22:14
Sabrina late Sunday night the four men
22:17
suspected of carrying out the concert
22:19
hall attack were arraigned in a court in
22:21
Moscow and charged with committing an
22:23
act of terrorism all four are from
22:27
Tajikistan but were worked as migrant
22:29
laborers in Russia they range in age
22:32
from 19 to 32 and face a maximum
22:36
sentence of life in prison also on
22:39
Sunday Russian authorities said that 137
22:43
bodies had been recovered from the
22:45
charred remains of the concert hall
22:47
including those of three

23:11
back here's what else you need to know
23:14
today in January I underwent major
23:16
abdominal surgery in London and at the
23:19
time it was thought that my condition
23:21
was
23:22
non-cancerous the surgery was successful
23:25
however test after the operation found
23:28
cancer had been
23:29
present in a video message on Friday
23:32
Catherine Princess of Wales disclosed
23:35
that she'd been diagnosed with cancer
23:37
and has begun chemotherapy ending weeks
23:40
of fevered speculation about her absence
23:43
from British public life this of course
23:45
came as a huge shock and William and I
23:48
have been doing everything we can to
23:50
process and manage this
23:53
privately in her message Middleton did
23:56
not say what kind of cancer she had had
23:59
or how far it had progressed but
24:01
emphasized that the diagnosis has
24:03
required meaningful time to process it
24:07
has taken me time to recover from major
24:09
surgery in order to start my treatment
24:12
but most importantly it has taken us
