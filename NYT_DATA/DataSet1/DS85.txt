A Journey Through Putinâ€™s Russia



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina tavernes and this is the [Music]
0:12
daily Russians go to the polls today in the first presidential election since their country invaded Ukraine 2 years
0:19
ago the war was expected to carry a steep cost for Vladimir Putin but as my
0:26
colleague Valerie Hopkins explains the opposite has happened happened today
0:32
Valerie travels around Russia to understand how Putin has done it and how
0:38
long that can
0:43
last it's Friday March [Music]
0:49
15th so Valerie the presidential elections in Russia are starting today
Putins Support
0:55
and it's the first one since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine two years ago and back then you know there
1:01
was this idea that the war could potentially become ruinous for Vladimir
1:06
Putin both politically and economically and here we are with Putin running for
1:12
reelection two years later so we come to you as our on the ground Russia expert
1:18
to talk about where we are in the ark of President Putin's power well Saina these
1:24
elections are set to run Friday to Sunday 29 regions are are voting online
1:31
and some of them have already started and it's a big event for Putin but you
1:36
and I both know very well that elections aren't necessarily the best measure of
1:43
the People's Choice in Russia um Putin is running once again without any real
1:51
genuine competition some of my friends in Moscow actually just refer to it as the voting the voting because it's not
1:58
really an election people are going to vote but it's not truly a choice exactly so Putin is expected to just Glide to
2:07
another six-year term his Fifth and that puts him on a path to becoming the longest serving leader in Russia since
2:13
the Russian Revolution more than 100 years ago W incredible and what's so remarkable is
2:18
that this isn't just a story about an autocrat extending his Reign this is a
2:24
leader with pretty Skyhigh polling numbers right now and seemingly Broad
2:30
support so tell me about that what is that support I mean Sabrina you and I both know that opinion polls are to be
2:38
taken with a grain of salt in Russia especially in a time when repression has
2:43
become very intense and is only getting stronger by the month but you know polls
2:48
conducted by independent pulsers like the levada center which use focus groups and really big sample sizes show that
2:56
Putin's approval rating is at 86% wow the highest in nearly a decade
3:02
86% yeah and even the more general question is Russia going in the right
3:08
direction that answer has really shocked me it's 75% right now it's the highest
3:15
it's ever been since a pollster started asking the question in 1996 that is incredible I mean the highest number
3:21
since the beginning of polling basically yes and you know for me that's really so in congruous because remember you and I
3:28
were on the ground Ukraine when the war started and Russia began being deluged
3:34
with Western sanctions you know one company after another announced they were pulling out and then slowly it
3:40
became clear that this war was going to last much longer and be far more deadly
3:46
than anyone originally expected I think including Mr Putin himself and it seemed
3:51
like Russia's future was a massive question mark So looking at the polls now it's kind of remarkable to see that
3:58
Putin has managed to get past all of that and so I really wanted to get out into the country and talk to some of the
4:04
people behind these numbers to understand what it is that has kept
4:11
their support for Vladimir Putin so high and how he's been able to defy the
4:17
expectations that so many people had at the beginning of this war so where did you start so a few months ago I decided
4:25
to go to the ninth largest city in Russia Samara it's a city on the vulgar River and I was interested in Samara
4:33
because it's a pretty big industrial city and I really wanted to see how ordinary people living there were
4:39
feeling about the war and were experiencing all these changes to Russia's economic life I mean again this
4:46
was one of the big questions hanging over the war would it crater the Russian economy and it occurred to me that a
4:53
really good place to get a feel for that is at the mall so I went to one downtown with a
Russian Malls
5:01
couple of my colleagues and I was really interested to go and see what ordinary life is like for people who are doing
5:08
some shopping or catching a film Valerie you are our Russian Mall expert also our Russia expert but our Russian Mall
5:14
expert continue what did you see in this one this mall was really
5:20
interesting you know I saw a lot of
5:26
activity one thing I have to say I appreciate is that there a group of young teenage boys who are playing with
5:32
large size chess pieces very Russian there's no empty storefronts
5:39
they've all been replaced by new brands um from different countries in the world
5:45
some of them Russian some of them from the Middle East the gulf Etc and let me
5:51
tell you Sabrina that's really different from what I saw in malls even in Central Moscow at the end of
5:56
2022 many Russian especially young hip Urban Russians were devastated by the
6:03
departures of Zara H&M McDonald's Coca-Cola and these were departures of
6:09
Western companies because of the sanctions absolutely and you would go to
6:14
malls and it would just feel like a dead zone stores shuttered dark hallways you
6:20
could see what was no longer available to you as a Russian consumer and now all
6:25
that has changed but I don't know there's also a lot of news was like B free and GJ like
6:32
I don't know what that is oh but that's a Russian brand right of course Zara and H&M have been
6:40
replaced by stores that we in the states have never heard of but you could still
6:45
get a lot of the same Goods it seemed like your average Mall teenagers walking
6:52
around drinking [Music] soda us F you oh
7:03
one of the big questions I get from friends back home is did you tried the fake Coca-Cola doca the new brand that
7:12
has essentially taken over all of Coca-Cola's business inside of Russia so
7:17
I've just bought a do Cola and for the uninitiated doola means good Cola right
7:25
cool Cola I mean yeah I've seen various translations good Cola cool Cola let's see if there's any difference
7:34
whatsoever I don't think so so what is good Cola taste like pretty much like
7:39
the real thing maybe like a normal knockoff Coke do you think there's any difference um a little bit
7:48
really I don't know if Coca-Cola like took their secret sauce when they left or not but I don't mean to paint a
7:54
picture of a mall full of only knockoffs you know I think frankly I was Aston
7:59
by the amount of Western Goods still available there was still Chanel all of
8:06
the luxury cosmetics and perfume are widely available in Russia so really
8:12
what you're seeing is a mall that has actually returned to some semblance of
8:17
economic normal yeah in the past two years Russia has been able to really
8:22
successfully reorient its economy consumers clearly still have the money
8:28
to buy expensive Western Products so they're often paying a huge premium importing them from China from
8:35
Kazakhstan from Georgia Armenia and the neighboring countries through middleman oh let's talk to the m Apple people
8:42
they're selling all the Apple products let's find out like how do they get them are they more expensive
8:48
the this became really clear to me once I set foot into a shop selling Apple
8:55
products so tell me about that shop so it looked like an ordinary Apple store
9:01
they had all the MacBooks and MacBook Pros and accessories iPhones and in fact
9:07
when I first went in just to inquire about the price the salesman that I talked to was
9:14
really proud to say that it wasn't that much more expensive than the west and that actually they had gotten the latest
9:20
iPhone model in stock 3 days only after it debuted in America interesting so
9:27
what did the guy say
9:32
he kind of shrugged his shoulders about the economy about the sanctions he said
9:38
you know we have no problems getting any of this stuff in people are still able to buy it and he told me that he
9:45
actually felt very confident that Russia would be able to survive and maybe even
9:52
Thrive
9:58
economically he compared Russia to Iran which has been under sanctions for
10:04
decades not that it's the most economically successful country in the
10:09
world his point was that other countries have figured out how to survive economic sanctions and Russia is as well
10:17
positioned as anyone to do that I mean he mentioned how resourc rich Russia is
10:22
it's one of the world's biggest oil producers and that has already helped it to generate money to keep the economy
10:33
float so this is one of the keys to Putin's success right keep the people
10:39
happy with iPhones have the stuff still come in make sure that they're not cut off from the world in terms of the stuff
10:46
that they want exactly standing in this fake Apple Store in the Samara Mall the
10:52
war felt really distant to this guy you know he's injured so he couldn't be
10:58
mobilized although he does feel bad for some of his friends who are fighting but
11:03
he said the war is not really this immediate presence in his life and that his life really hasn't changed at all H
11:10
and when I thought about it more it wasn't all that surprising to me I mean here we were in a relatively big city
11:17
and I knew that Russia had been drafting far more soldiers from rural areas around the country than they are from
11:25
cities I started to think I needed to go further a field to the more rural
11:32
communities that are actually bearing the brunt of this war so my team and I hopped in a car and
11:40
we drove for hours along a poth hold road all the way to a little village
11:46
called [Music] oatmeal we'll be right
Odessa
11:57
back so Valerie tell me tell me about the town of oatmeal and is it actually called oatmeal well yes I mean in
12:05
Russian it's of Sanka it was a collective Farm back in the days of the
12:10
Soviet Union in some of the Open Fields you can just see like the remains of
12:15
collapsed infrastructure but the village of oena itself provides almost no jobs
12:22
mostly people are working in subsistence agriculture or you know hunting for
12:28
scrap metal doing odd jobs here and there I mean the place is really
12:34
impoverished every year it seems like there's another suicide which in a really small place takes its toll it
12:42
feels like a place with a lot of Despair so really kind of a classic posts Soviet
12:49
you know economically depressed landscape a place that had been this large functioning farm this Collective
12:56
farm with the whole village employed in working it and after the Soviet collapse that just
13:03
died right I mean this is a place that really hasn't seen any of the fruits of Putin's economic success
13:09
story and these small depressed Villages are the kind of places that have sent a
13:14
lot of people to this war so I arrived in oatmeal and went
13:21
straight to the house of the kadira family who had lost their son in the
13:28
war and I was really interested in how the
13:34
family would make sense of their loss and of the war and what they thought of
13:39
Russia in that moment and what they thought of Putin who launched this
13:45
war and as we arrived the family were waiting for his body to be brought by by
13:54
the local military officials and as we sat cross-legged on
14:00
the floor of their main room as mourners kind of trickled in and out to pay their
14:05
respects they told me about him
14:12
um his name was Gary P
14:18
asadov he was an ethnic kazak like most of his relatives but to his friends and
14:25
family he was known by his Russian nickname Vita
14:34
he was a softspoken farmer and shortly after Vladimir Putin
14:39
announced a general mobilization officials from the military commissariat came to his house and told
14:46
him he was going with them and so you know his family said
14:52
that though he didn't expect to be drafted as soon as he was called up he said it was his duty
15:00
and he went that very day to start his military training but after just a few months
15:09
into his Tour of Duty he was killed in a part of Ukraine that had been a meat
15:14
grinder for Russian
15:20
soldiers shortly after we arrived a military Convoy came carrying his
15:27
body his mother sobbed most of the day and
15:34
one of his sisters was wailing so much that she needed to take
15:43
sedatives and just witnessing the pain it was
15:50
immense and then the whole village assembled for a formal ceremony for him
15:58
with military
16:04
honors the head of the district government even came to
16:09
speak he gave a patriotic speech about him dying for the sake of
16:18
Freedom he said it is precisely thanks to guys like him that there are peaceful
16:24
Skies over our country and by participating in the special military operation which is what Russia calls the
16:31
war they are protecting our freedom our lives and the health of our
16:41
children so what did the family make of all of this well despite the fact that
16:47
they had lost their son their brother in the war despite the the poverty and pain
16:54
of this small village community
17:02
you hear them embracing certain elements of Putin's messaging around the war you know many relatives repeated a
17:10
lot of the shorthand that Putin has been using from the
17:17
beginning saying that this was for the good of the motherland you
17:25
know and that this has long been Russian Terror that most of Ukraine has always
17:32
historically been a part of Russia that ukrainians and Russians are actually one ethnic
17:41
[Music] group one thing that really stuck out to me the most was the fervent belief that
17:50
this is a war against the West there was a strong conviction that
17:56
the West had turned Ukraine against Russia and and this was not a war of choice for
18:05
Putin so you know I don't think this was purely that they were taking Putin's
18:10
propaganda wholesale you know but you could see a need to make sense of their
18:18
loss and to understand the tragedy that befell their [Music]
Compensation
18:25
family but there is another ele in this too you know which is something the the
18:32
family didn't really speak about and that's the fact that you know men who
18:38
often are not able to really provide very much for their families while they're alive know that if they do die
18:45
their family can get you know somewhere up to 60 70
18:50
$80,000 in compensation payments after their death wow so extremely meaningful
18:59
for a family like VZ absolutely you know this is a place where presumably people
19:05
are you know living on maybe the equivalent of a hundred a couple hundred dollars a month so these salaries are an
19:13
incredible Boon and in fact you know Putin in his most recent State of the Union speech last month actually talked
19:20
about wanting to elevate the role of soldiers and veterans in society and
19:26
give them more leadership roles and uh more opportunities and you know this is
19:31
widely perceived as an attempt by Putin to kind of re-engineer a new middle
19:37
class comprised of people involved in the war effort wow God I mean it's very
19:43
dark but it's also quite cunning of Putin right that there is an economic
19:49
element to this war for the people who are dying and that is something that can
19:55
blunt any potential political opposition to it so the people doing the dying are not going to be the people asking the
20:02
questions in part because this money is coming in and he knows that yes and I mean Sabrina I've spoken to other family
20:09
members who have lost their sons and and husbands in this war and they all say
20:14
that no amount of money can can bring back their son but it does have an effect of making these families far less
20:23
vocal and far less um prone to uniting in some kind of a pro movement that
20:29
could challenge
20:38
Putin but you know Sabrina with with all that being said the longer I spent time
20:44
in the kirov house the more I realized that there were so many layers to this family's
20:51
grief and that there were people present at the funeral who really aren't on the
20:58
same page about this war so tell me about those people so I had this really
21:05
surreal reporting experience after this military honors ceremony the Crimson
21:13
military issued casket was actually brought into the house where according
21:18
to local custom VTO was to spend one final night at home before being buried
21:24
in a nearby cemetery and as members of his family gathered around his
21:30
coffin they got into a debate actually about why he died wow you know they're
21:38
gathered around his CIT nobody knows what was inside the members of the family knew that the body had actually
21:45
been decomposing for some time in the trench before the Russians were able to to get it out so you know many people
21:52
were heartbroken that they they couldn't wash the body they couldn't see the body and I think that drove
21:59
one of the family members especially to start speaking out against the
22:08
[Music] war he called the war in Ukraine
22:13
nonsense wow and then he said what defending the
22:18
motherland from who he said that he thought the people
22:25
who believed that this war was necessary had been in some kind of a
22:32
stuper he was one of the few people in the family who was willing to say actually we attacked Ukraine not the
22:39
other way around you know amazing there were other people around who chimed
22:49
in one family member compared it to to Putin's annexation of Crimea saying you
22:54
know what do we even need that for in other words like Russia is already such
23:00
a vast and huge country I mean the biggest one territorially in the world like why do we need new territories and
23:07
this idea of a greater unified Russia encompassing Ukrainian land wasn't
23:14
really Landing for [Music]
23:20
him I mean these are very brave questions right you know saying this also to you sitting there an American
23:27
reporter like this is the thing Putin has really been focused on the people not say
23:33
things like this right and and yet there they were saying these things against the war there's no doubt this is a
23:40
really dangerous thing to say to a journalist at a time
23:46
when the Russian government is really policing all kind of dissenting voices
23:53
on this war and the extent of repression in Russia now is so strong wrong that
24:00
even Whispering about them can get you in huge trouble can land you in jail can
24:05
land you with a fine you know with my colleague Anton trnovski and and other members of the our Bureau we've been
24:13
reporting on the way that you know people have been fined for anti-war
24:19
scribbles on a bathroom wall or a simple you know request to a DJ to play a song
24:24
by a Ukrainian musician not to mention people who take the risk of standing in
24:30
the street with an anti-war slogan right boosting the economy and paying off soldiers is one thing but repression is
24:37
really the foundation of what Putin has been up to here absolutely I mean that's what holds this whole system together
24:45
right you know there are a lot of people in Russia who share anti-war views and
24:52
who are fed up with more than two decades of Putin in power but they have
24:57
very little recourse to do anything to change the situation at this
25:03
point we've been reminded of that in the past few weeks in the aftermath of the
25:08
death of Alexa naani the biggest and most important opposition politician and
25:13
dissident in post Soviet Russia you know his supporters have shown up to
25:19
memorials to his funeral but everywhere you turn you're reminded of the
25:24
repression that still keeps all of them in check I went to some of the memorials
25:30
and watched as riot police stood on checking people's IDs and encouraging
25:36
people not to linger while I was there I talked to a 17-year-old student who said
25:43
he had been too scared to put down flowers because of possible consequences and you know he's right to worry I mean
25:51
hundreds of people have been arrested across Russia for the simple Act of laying down flowers or publicly Mourning
25:58
Mr naal wow so even in this moment where the opposition may have been galvanized
26:04
to some degree in the leadup to election day we're still reminded of the hold that Putin has on
26:10
[Music] Russia so Valerie to answer the question
Conclusion
26:16
you started with you know how has Putin managed to keep such a tight grip on
26:21
things repression is still Central to how he's doing that but he's also worked
26:26
extremely hard to keep people happy right in malls with their iPhones
26:32
keeping the economy going and also paying out those bonuses to soldiers families in these very poor areas and at
26:39
this moment heading into his reelection that's all basically working that's true Sabrina but these
26:47
are a lot of plates he's spinning you know trying to keep the economy afloat
26:54
while paying huge salaries to military personnel and you know revamping the
27:00
entire military industry the Kremlin has dipped into reserves to make these
27:06
Financial payments the economy has changed so much and no one knows how it
27:12
will be affected in the long run the oil price could change and on top of that the kernel of descent remains despite
27:20
this inertia of repression interesting so you know he's of course very much in control but it's
27:26
tenuous right I mean for it to work Putin really needs to keep his eyes on
27:32
all of these areas at once absolutely Sabrina I mean it's a precarious
27:39
[Music] balance and you know traveling across
27:44
this vast country I've seen the tremendous power and reach of Putin even
27:51
if these elections are not legitimate he's still on the cusp of becoming one of the longest serving leaders in
27:57
Russia's history and that is a testament to his tremendous staying power but you also do
28:03
see the cracks and the tension here and so the question is whether these cracks begin to widen or whether Putin will
28:11
prevail as he has over yet another tumultuous period in Russia's
28:17
[Music] history Valerie thank you thank you
28:27
Sabrina Alexa naval's Widow Julia naal has
28:35
called on Russians who oppos Putin to show up at the polls at noon on Sunday
28:40
as a sign of collective protest earlier this week naval's top Aid Leonid vov who
28:47
was helping lead that call to action was beaten and sprayed with tear gas near
28:52
his home in vilnus Lithuania just hours before the attack vov had in an interview in which he
28:59
expressed concern for the safety of naval's supporters saying quote the key
29:06
risk is that we will all be
29:12
killed we'll be right [Music]
29:27
back here's what else you should know today a
29:33
jury in Michigan found James Crumbley guilty of involuntary manslaughter holding him partially responsible for
29:39
failing to prevent his son from carrying out the state's deadliest school shooting in
29:46
2021 crumley's wife was convicted of similar charges in a separate trial last
29:51
month the couple's parenting skills had come under intense scrutiny as had their
29:56
son's access to a handgun that his father had bought now two separate
30:02
juries have taken the unusual step of holding parents criminally responsible
30:07
for their child's crimes and Senate Majority Leader Chuck
30:13
Schumer of New York condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during
30:19
a speech on the senate floor calling him a major obstacle to peace in the Middle
30:24
East and calling for new leadership in Israel as a lifelong supporter of Israel
30:30
it has become clear to me the Netanyahu Coalition no longer fits the needs of
30:36
Israel after October 7th Schumer's speech was the sharpest critique yet
30:41
from a senior American elected official he was effectively urging Israelis to
30:46
replace Netanyahu who is under indictment in Israel for bribery and fraud I believe in his heart he has his
30:55
highest priority is the security of his Israel however I also believe prime
31:01
minister Netanyahu has lost his way Schumer the highest ranking Jewish
31:07
elected official in the United States said that he believed that Netanyahu had chosen himself and his ambition as a
31:15
politician over his country Schumer also said that Netanyahu had allowed too many
31:22
civilian deaths in Gaza which he argued had reduced support for Israel around
