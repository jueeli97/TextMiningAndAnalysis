Is $60 Billion Enough to Save Ukraine?


0:01
from The New York Times I'm Sabrina
0:03
tavernes and this is the
0:07
[Music]
0:11
daily late last night a long delayed Aid
0:15
package for Ukraine passed its final
0:17
hurdle in Congress throwing the
0:19
embattled country a $60 billion Lifeline
0:23
but given Ukraine's desperation on the
0:26
battlefield will that be enough to save
0:28
it today my colleague Mark santor
0:36
explains it's Wednesday April
0:40
[Music]
0:43
24th so Mark last night after many many
0:46
months the US Congress finally approved
0:49
an aid package to Ukraine it passed in
0:51
the Senate just before 10 p.m. and of
0:54
course it's very very substantial
0:56
billions and billions of dollars but we
0:58
also know that the war is not going well
1:01
at all for the ukrainians right now
1:04
you've been in Ukraine covering this war
1:06
since the beginning in 20122 you're in
1:09
Kiev right now so my question for you is
1:12
this what does all of this money mean
1:15
for Ukraine at this point in the war is
1:17
it going to make a difference given the
1:20
state of
1:21
things 100% it's going to make a
1:23
difference and the ukrainians had been
1:26
waiting for months and months for this
1:28
news 60 billion of which 46 billion is
1:32
military aid basically is the equivalent
1:34
of all that the United States has given
1:36
Ukraine over the past two years in total
1:40
so it's a lot of money it's a lot of
1:41
supplies it can buy a lot of what
1:43
Ukraine needs but they need it right now
1:46
because the situation across the front
1:49
has been turning increasingly Grim for
1:51
The ukrainians Who find themselves
1:53
outmanned and out guned so on that point
1:56
mark it's been a couple of months now
1:58
since we last talked about the war on
2:00
the show and you know I've been reading
2:03
your coverage our colleagues coverage
2:06
and it looks like a very desperate
2:08
situation for the ukrainians remind us
2:11
why that is right so first of all if we
2:14
just step back a
2:16
little first year of the war was one
2:19
that started with shock at the breath of
2:21
what Russia was trying to do invade and
2:24
capture a nation of 40 million people
2:26
the largest in Europe and then it was
2:28
about Russian failure and Ukrainian
2:31
success in pushing back that Invasion
2:33
first protecting the capital then
2:35
reclaiming like 50% of the country right
2:38
that was the David and Goliath story
2:39
that was year one yeah exactly and I
2:42
think Ukraine surprised the world they
2:44
surprised the Kremlin and maybe even
2:45
they surprised themselves a bit but the
2:47
year ended on sort of this optimistic
2:49
note that Ukraine cannot just hold their
2:52
own but they can take the fight to the
2:53
Russians and then we get to year
2:57
two and year two is this year of Gastly
3:01
violence but very little change along
3:03
the front lines Russia tries to do an
3:05
offensive they fail Ukraine tries to do
3:07
an offensive they fail Russia again they
3:10
try and gain more land and largely fail
3:13
so you have this sort of back and forth
3:14
going on but at the end of year two
3:18
something changes for the first time in
3:20
the course of the war USA first slows
3:24
and then it basically stops so as we get
3:27
into year three now we see the
3:29
ukrainians they're not not just stuck
3:30
but they're basically fighting to hold
3:32
on for dear
3:35
[Music]
3:38
life and what does it look like right
3:41
now to be holding on for dear life
3:43
describe that for us so Sabrina there
3:46
are three main challenges and the first
3:48
most critical and probably the most
3:51
obvious is a shortage of weapons and
3:54
ammunition for those weapons it's pretty
3:56
simple in war the side that can't shoot
3:59
back generally
4:00
loses and when we would go on visits to
4:03
the front line over the course of the
4:05
winter and then into the spring here
4:07
what we found were commanders who were
4:09
rationing their shells they had maybe
4:12
one for every three Russian shells in
4:15
the late winter and then it went to one
4:17
to every for every five Russian shells
4:19
and more recently it's 1 to 10 so they
4:23
found themselves you know not just in a
4:25
position of being outgunned but outgun
4:27
to such a degree that they might have to
4:29
fall back
4:30
simply put running out of bullets which
4:32
is the most basic building block of War
4:35
yeah and this war in particular 80% of
4:38
the deaths have been from direct fire
4:41
from artillery and Rockets and the way
4:44
the Russians fight sending wave after
4:46
wave of soldiers to attack Ukrainian
4:48
trenches and
4:49
fortifications the main way you stop
4:52
these waves of attacks is kill as many
4:54
of the attackers as you can and without
4:57
artillery you simply can't kill enough
5:00
people and So eventually their positions
5:02
will become overrun and they'll have to
5:04
fall back and in the past couple months
5:08
we've started to really see that and the
5:10
impact it's having on the battlefield as
5:12
Ukraine loses
5:14
territory okay so that's artillery what
5:17
else what I think almost every Ukrainian
5:19
would tell you what they desperately
5:21
need are air defense systems and the
5:24
Munitions that make those systems work
5:28
so when we're talking about air defense
5:29
systems we're talking about a whole
5:32
range of stuff from basically guys on
5:34
the back of pickup trucks with machine
5:36
guns who are searching for Russian
5:38
drones in the sky to the most
5:40
sophisticated air defense systems that
5:43
only America can provide which are
5:45
called The Patriot batteries so Russia's
5:49
most sophisticated missiles fly like 10
5:51
times the speed of sound that's where
5:53
you need something like the Patriot and
5:55
these are the only thing Ukraine has
5:57
really that can shoot down Russian
5:59
ballistic missiles so these are like
6:01
defending the skies basically like it's
6:04
very very dangerous to not have them
6:06
it's not just dangerous for the people
6:08
in the cities and towns it's really
6:11
dangerous for the troops on the front
6:12
line because the other thing air defense
6:14
systems give you is it prevents or at
6:18
least it deters Russian fighter pilots
6:21
from flying into the area where these
6:23
things are operating so once these air
6:25
defenses basically ran out Russian
6:28
fighter bombers are are now basically
6:31
strafing the front line flying closer
6:33
and closer and dropping these massive
6:35
bombs onto Ukrainian fortifications and
6:38
also some of these towns and cities that
6:41
had been out of range of Russian
6:43
Artillery and Mark what are we seeing as
6:45
a result of Ukraine being kind of naked
6:48
in the sky like this well on the front
6:51
it's opened up this whole new challenge
6:53
because it's allowed Russian war planes
6:56
to basically dip into Russia's almost
6:58
Limitless stock of one ton two ton big
7:02
bombs that were built ages ago but that
7:05
they can strap Wings to and guidance
7:07
systems and obliterate Ukrainian
7:10
fortifications I mean I'll just tell you
7:12
personally you know whenever you go into
7:14
a combat zone it's the noise that
7:15
strikes you first but the first time I
7:18
heard these things it shocked me we were
7:21
outside of Diva maybe two miles away and
7:25
you just heard this thunder and Russia
7:27
was dropping at the peak of the battle
7:29
for atifa something like 250 of these in
7:32
48 hours each of them weighing and
7:34
loaded with more than one ton of
7:36
explosives it's really hard to get your
7:38
head around just how big this is so the
7:41
introduction of these in Mass along the
7:43
front has really changed the dynamic and
7:45
presented all kinds of problems for the
7:47
ukrainians of DF of course being the
7:49
town that Russia took this winter after
7:52
practically obliterating it exactly and
7:54
so then when you take this all together
7:56
the introduction of these heavy bombs
7:58
the lack of Defense against ballistic
8:00
missiles what you see is it's starting
8:02
to take a growing toll on civilians as
8:04
well the UN estimated that in March we
8:09
saw a 20% increase in the number of
8:11
Civilian deaths compared to just the
8:13
month before and they attributed that
8:16
mostly to widespread and more successful
8:19
Russian aerial strikes so this is really
8:21
just a disaster for Ukraine right I mean
8:23
it's running out of almost everything
8:26
and this is put it in kind of a
8:27
defensive Crouch it's really a complete
8:30
turnaround from where it was at the
8:31
beginning of the war what's the second
8:34
challenge Ukraine has been dealing with
8:36
well this is a challenge that affects
8:38
really the entire country and that has
8:40
to do with the power grid the ability of
8:43
Russia to Target and Target successfully
8:46
a number of key Ukrainian power
8:48
generating facilities has had a
8:50
devastating impact on Ukraine's ability
8:53
to Supply Power particularly in the East
8:57
we just came back from harke in eastern
9:00
Ukraine where Russia has completely
9:02
destroyed every single thermal power
9:05
plant the city had to produce its own
9:07
power so it's basically trying to bring
9:10
power from across the country to provide
9:14
at least a minimal level of energy for
9:17
critical infrastructure like water and
9:19
sewage and people have you know
9:21
sometimes as little as two three hours
9:23
of power a day and then if you just you
9:26
know pull back a bit you look across the
9:28
country and I'm met with the head of one
9:30
of the major power utilities here who
9:33
said that these strikes starting on
9:36
March 22nd really have been more
9:39
successful and done more damage to the
9:41
Ukrainian power grid than even the
9:44
strikes that occurred in the first
9:45
winter of War which if you remember
9:48
Sabrina those almost took down the grid
9:50
and caused the country to go into a
9:52
blackout so Ukraine is in a really tough
9:56
spot when it comes to power generation
9:58
so this all all adds up to a pretty
10:01
serious problem for Ukraine right I mean
10:03
lack of electricity can really a
10:06
country's economy absolutely Sabrina and
10:09
you know these power outages they affect
10:10
civilians across the
10:12
country which brings us to probably our
10:15
third biggest challenge for Ukraine
10:18
which is people they need soldiers and
10:22
this is by all accounts the deadliest
10:24
war since the end of the second world
10:25
war even conservative estimates put the
10:28
number of Ukrainian and Russian soldiers
10:31
killed and wounded at over a half a
10:34
million wow the Russians are dying
10:36
probably at a rate of maybe 3 to one
10:38
according to most analysts although
10:39
these numbers are fuzzy so you have a
10:42
situation where you have this incredibly
10:45
deadly front and you have people across
10:49
the country who still by and large
10:52
supporting the military doing what they
10:54
can sewing blankets donating building
10:57
drones volunteering in many ways
10:59
but a lot of people are really just
11:01
afraid afraid that if they go volunteer
11:04
or go into the military they're going to
11:05
be put into the Infantry right away and
11:07
then rushed off to the front and put in
11:09
a trench and quite frankly it's it's
11:12
really
11:13
scary so that is a big problem for
11:16
Ukraine if they're not getting the
11:18
soldiers at the front then they're not
11:20
really able to continue their War so
11:23
what are they doing to combat that well
11:26
the main way is something they call
11:28
mobilization we would probably call a
11:30
draft which is basically recruiting
11:34
everyone between a certain age to serve
11:37
in the military but it was created back
11:41
in the Soviet era there are ways that
11:44
people find around it for instance by
11:46
not registering other people have been
11:48
found to sort of paid bribes to get out
11:50
of it a few thousand have fled the
11:52
country to avoid it basically it was
11:55
just a mess and so the zalinsky
11:58
government knew they needed to rewrite
12:01
and change this law to give it a bit
12:03
more order but that was politically
12:06
risky because this is a country that
12:09
does not have a lot of young men so
12:12
what's ended up happening is you have
12:14
the situation where people who signed up
12:17
more than two years ago are still
12:19
fighting on the front with very little
12:22
rest and the average age of the soldier
12:24
in the trenches is now 40 wow 40 that's
12:28
really up there for a
12:30
soldier precisely and the government
12:33
here was really resistant and afraid of
12:37
throwing its youngest generation and
12:39
losing them in this war but on the flip
12:43
side most people here really feel this
12:45
is an existential War a struggle for
12:47
their survival so if they don't win it
12:50
there will be no Society for these young
12:52
people worth growing up in so earlier
12:56
this month president zalinski relent did
12:59
and he lowered the draft age from 27 to
13:02
25 so effectively broadening the pool of
13:06
potential men he could draft as soldiers
13:09
right so upping his numbers exactly
13:12
that's the goal but again these things
13:14
take time to translate from legislation
13:16
and changes to the battlefield which of
13:20
course brings us to this moment and the
13:23
passage of the aid through Congress
13:25
right and the key question is what's
13:28
coming and perhaps more importantly how
13:32
fast is it going to get
13:34
[Music]
13:42
here we'll be right back
13:45
[Music]
14:03
so the aid package finally passed
14:05
through Congress it's real what does it
14:08
look like in practice I mean what are
14:10
the actual things that Ukraine is going
14:12
to be getting well Sabrina as we're
14:14
taping this we don't know precisely but
14:16
we do know broadly what's going to be in
14:19
these first batch of stuff coming here
14:21
which is number one the ammunition for
14:25
the artillery number two the air defense
14:30
missiles and interceptors for the air
14:32
defense systems but most critically more
14:35
than each individual thing is quantity
14:39
they're going to get resupplies in the
14:41
kind of quantity they desperately need
14:44
as much as each particular thing they
14:45
need is important it's also important
14:48
that they get a lot of them so
14:50
essentially they're hoping that in this
14:52
Aid package they'll be able to replenish
14:54
their ammunition their artillery and
14:57
Take Back Control of their Skies by
14:59
getting some replenishments of those
15:01
Patriot missiles that you were telling
15:02
us about precisely to close the skies
15:06
and basically repair and fortify and
15:09
solidify what are currently fraying
15:12
front lines that are in danger along
15:14
multiple points of the front and what
15:17
else are they going to get so one of the
15:20
things they've asked for and wanted
15:23
since the earliest months of the war
15:25
which are Precision long range missiles
15:29
known as attacks attacks yeah attacks uh
15:32
it's an abbreviation but it does what it
15:34
sounds like which is it attacks and it
15:37
it can attack at distance and so what
15:40
Ukraine has wanted desperately is to be
15:42
able to hit Russia anywhere on Ukrainian
15:46
territory including Crimea where Russian
15:50
forces are currently based and for the
15:53
longest time throughout this war Ukraine
15:55
has kind of been having to fight with
15:57
one hand tied behind its back Russia can
16:00
reach any corner of Ukraine but Ukraine
16:03
can't even hit Russia on every corner of
16:05
their own country and the Biden
16:08
Administration for months and months
16:10
worried that these weapons could be seen
16:13
as escalatory in some way by Moscow but
16:17
I think the decision was made that
16:19
Ukraine needs all it can at this moment
16:21
in the fight and Ukraine is hoping to
16:25
use these weapons to go after some
16:27
targets that have long been on their
16:29
list none more so than this bridge that
16:32
connects Crimea to Russia after Russia
16:36
illegally annexed Crimea in 2014 Putin
16:39
you know this is for him the symbol of
16:41
the connection between Crimea and Russia
16:44
and for ukrainians it's the exact
16:47
opposite they've tried twice now to take
16:49
it out they've blown up a truck bomb on
16:51
it they've sent Maritime drones loaded
16:53
with explosives to blow up under it
16:55
they've done damage to it but they
16:57
haven't been able to take out and I
17:00
think anyone who's watched this war
17:02
knows that this on the list of targets
17:04
Ukraine has that they think could make a
17:06
difference this bridge is high up on
17:09
that list it would be important
17:11
militarily but also very important
17:13
symbolically like Ukraine would actually
17:14
be able to strike this important piece
17:17
of infrastructure for the Russians
17:20
exactly okay so the Americans are
17:22
actually relenting on their earlier
17:23
skepticism and actually giving the
17:25
ukrainians something that is very
17:27
precise and potenti damaging for Russia
17:31
right and the Biden Administration has
17:34
relented and is allowing Ukraine's
17:37
allies in Europe to provide something
17:39
else Ukraine desperately wanted which
17:41
are F-16 fighter jets now these are not
17:44
part of this military aid package but it
17:47
took a decision of the Biden
17:48
Administration to allow these fighter
17:51
jets to be sent to Ukraine since they're
17:53
American made and several European
17:56
countries have already committed to
17:58
giving ukra dozens of these and Pilots
18:01
as we speak have been training on them
18:03
for months we don't know when they're
18:04
going to appear in the sky some people
18:06
think by mid late summer but that will
18:09
be another part of what Ukraine thinks
18:11
is essential to have the kind of layered
18:14
air defense that will allow it to
18:16
finally protect its Skies from these
18:19
deadly and Relentless bombardments okay
18:22
so the US is replenishing supplies but
18:24
it's also sending stuff that they'd
18:26
never sent before including American
18:29
made f-16s through the Europeans but
18:32
what do we know about when it will
18:34
actually get to Ukraine like What's the
18:36
timing here yeah so again this comes
18:38
back to the question of quantity I think
18:41
you know most people believe here will
18:43
start to see things relatively quickly
18:46
that some of this is positioned in
18:48
Poland already or in Europe and so the
18:50
minute after the president signs it
18:52
stuff will start moving but it's a
18:55
question really of how much they can get
18:58
and how fast so we talked earlier about
19:01
shell hunger this need of Ukrainian
19:03
commanders to be able to at least start
19:05
to match the number of shells the
19:07
Russians have and on an average day here
19:10
Ukraine can fire 10,000 rounds to
19:13
Russia's 20,000 rounds I mean we're
19:15
talking thousands and thousands of
19:17
rounds every day day after day so some
19:20
of it will move in quickly but it's much
19:22
harder to calculate when it'll start to
19:25
have a dynamic impact on the battlefield
19:27
but most people think uh it's probably a
19:29
month or two before we really see this
19:33
start to reshape the front line in the
19:35
fight there at least so this is a pretty
19:38
important moment and a real window of
19:41
time in which the Russians could kind of
19:43
take advantage of the ukrainians not
19:45
having the stuff yet right 100% Russia
19:49
they know that this stuff is coming and
19:51
so now they whatever plans they had they
19:54
might want to step up the Ukrainian
19:56
intelligence officials we talked to all
19:58
think that this next month here is going
20:00
to be particularly violent there's going
20:02
to be things that probably go wrong for
20:04
Ukraine and they're trying to brace the
20:06
public for that but they also have this
20:09
now because of this Aid bill passed by
20:11
the US chiefly this sort of longer term
20:14
optimism that they know that they're
20:16
going to stay in the fight whatever
20:17
these next few weeks bring and what are
20:20
we seeing the Russians actually do
20:23
what's happening right now on the front
20:25
yeah so nobody I speak to thinks the
20:27
fight's going to suddenly speed up up
20:29
somehow very dramatically and and
20:31
massive amounts of land will will change
20:32
hands but the place right now where
20:35
everyone is watching is a little Hilltop
20:37
town that before the war had maybe
20:39
15,000 people is now maybe a few hundred
20:42
left there that's been turned into
20:44
basically a Ukrainian Garrison just a
20:47
few miles west of bmot that serves as
20:50
sort of a key to the Eastern front in
20:53
some ways because if the Russians can
20:55
manage to drive the ukrainians out of
20:57
there it would give them these elevated
21:00
Heights to attack some of the last
21:02
remaining Ukrainian fortified cities in
21:05
the East so Ukraine is potentially about
21:08
to lose a key town to Russia right and
21:12
Russia is using the full arsenal the
21:15
advantage in ammunition and artillery
21:18
those big bombs they're dropping from
21:20
war planes and their advantage in
21:22
Manpower Point 20 to 25,000 soldiers to
21:25
take this little town that's about 5
21:27
square miles wide and president zinski
21:30
believes that they're doing it because
21:33
President Putin wants to have a victory
21:35
before May 9th and May 9th is this day
21:40
that was traditionally meant to
21:41
celebrate the Soviet Union's victory
21:44
over Nazi Germany but that Putin has
21:47
turned into this Marshall patriotic
21:50
display of Russian power right this is
21:53
kind of how he projects his power in the
21:55
country ex and he wants to have a
21:56
victory to show right so Mark stepping
21:59
back here for a moment you know we've
22:02
talked a lot on the show about how the
22:04
US Aid to Ukraine has never really been
22:08
quite at a level where Ukraine could
22:11
actually win the war right that it
22:14
stayed at this level where Ukraine
22:16
doesn't lose but isn't quite enough to
22:19
actually help it win I mean Ukraine is
22:22
in this terrible situation is this
22:24
enough to really jolt it into a winning
22:28
posture
22:29
what is this current trunch going to do
22:32
well s first and foremost what it's
22:34
going to do is stop the bleeding to some
22:36
degree it's going to give Ukraine a
22:39
better chance of preventing Russia from
22:42
taking more territory and I think it's
22:45
really worth pausing here and
22:47
remembering what Ukrainian defeat looks
22:49
like we we don't have to guess we've
22:51
seen places where Russian soldiers
22:54
occupied and then were driven out and I
22:56
visited the mass Graves where those
22:58
Russian soldiers murdered civilians the
23:00
torture chambers where they put
23:02
civilians trying to get information from
23:04
them we know that the Russian army
23:07
leaves a trail of Destruction everywhere
23:09
in its wake so first and foremost what
23:12
the ukrainians hope is that this robust
23:15
Aid package will allow them to stop the
23:18
Russian advance and then give them time
23:22
to regroup and rebuild so that going
23:25
forward they can take the fight back to
23:27
the Russians but that's part two part
23:29
one is
23:31
surviving one thing that seems clear to
23:34
me you know just from an American
23:36
political context is that this is
23:39
probably it for American Aid I mean this
23:41
is likely the final package like the end
23:44
of the line do ukrainians understand
23:47
that well I think before this long delay
23:50
in the aid everyone was looking at a
23:52
very specific date on the calendar which
23:53
was the American presidential election
23:56
nobody's under any illusions that
23:58
without American Support Ukraine would
24:01
probably lose this war they certainly
24:03
couldn't win this war and so I think you
24:06
know when we say what's going to happen
24:08
next this is enough money to get through
24:11
the next six months it seems like along
24:13
with stepped up European Aid and
24:15
Ukraine's own domestic production but I
24:17
think that everyone is watching
24:18
anxiously to see what happens in the
24:20
American presidential election and then
24:23
what impact that will have on American
24:25
support for Ukraine in this
24:27
war and Mark what about ukrainians
24:30
themselves what are they saying you talk
24:32
to people around the country it's
24:34
remarkable how much this package has
24:36
lifted the spirits of people across the
24:38
country who quite frankly have been
24:41
going through some of the worst months
24:44
since the earliest chaotic days of the
24:47
war but Sabrina it's important to
24:49
remember and not really be under any
24:51
Illusions here uh about just how hard it
24:53
is for ukrainians not just the soldiers
24:56
but millions of civilians
24:59
I recently took a trip out to the city
25:01
of harke and even though there are still
25:03
1.3 million people there they are now
25:06
living under a level of bombardment we
25:08
haven't seen since the first weeks of
25:10
the war and what we found in harke was
25:13
the question of what's going to happen
25:14
is not this meta question of how does
25:17
the war turn out it is how do I survive
25:19
the day we drove around with paramedics
25:23
firefighters and we saw block after
25:25
block with you know buildings all their
25:28
Windows shattered and blown out some
25:31
scarred with shrapnel others reduced to
25:35
Rubble it's a big city so even with a
25:37
Relentless missile bombardment there's
25:40
still activity people amazingly go to
25:43
work and go to coffee shops but at the
25:45
same time they go to bed each night with
25:47
the knowledge that the next missile
25:51
might fall either on them or someone
25:53
they love
25:56
[Music]
25:59
so Sabrina at its most basic level what
26:02
this Aid does for ukrainians who on a
26:05
daily bases are worried about what's
26:07
going to happen the next day is it
26:09
allows them to survive to fight and to
26:13
protect their cities from Russian
26:15
missile strikes and also to they hope
26:19
stabilize the situation on the
26:21
front but what this package doesn't do
26:24
is tell us the path forward for how
26:27
Ukraine can achieve what they really
26:29
want their ultimate goal which is
26:33
driving the Russians from their land and
26:35
securing the kind of victory that is
26:38
both
26:39
lasting and just in their
26:43
[Music]
26:49
minds mark thank you thank you Sabrina
26:53
[Music]
27:00
we'll be right
27:01
[Music]
27:10
back here's what else you should know
27:12
today on Tuesday in a major ruling the
27:16
Federal Trade Commission banned
27:18
companies from using non-compete
27:20
agreements that prevent their employees
27:23
from working for rival companies the FTC
27:27
argued that not competes which affect at
27:30
least a fifth of private sector workers
27:32
hold down wages by making it hard to
27:35
switch jobs a reliable way of securing a
27:39
raise and during his second day of
27:42
testimony in the hush money trial of
27:44
Donald Trump David pecker the former
27:47
publisher of the national Inquirer
27:49
confirmed his role in what prosecutors
27:52
have described as conspiracy to promote
27:55
Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and
27:58
damage the campaigns of Trump's rivals
28:02
on the stand pecker recalled a 2015
28:05
meeting in which Trump asked how pecker
28:08
could help his campaign in response
28:11
pecker told Trump quote I will be your
28:14
eyes and ears soon after in coordination
28:19
with Trump pecker said he began to use
28:21
the national Inquirer to purchase and
28:24
then kill off negative stories about
28:27
Trump in including claims that Trump had
28:29
fathered a child out of wedlock and had
28:32
had an affair with a former Playboy
28:35
model pecker is expected to resume his
28:38
testimony
