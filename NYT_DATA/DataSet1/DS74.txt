Ronna McDaniel, TV News and the Trump Problem


0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael babbaro this is the
0:06
[Music] daily today The Saga of Ronald McDaniel
0:14
and NBC and what it reveals about the state of television news headed into the
0:20
2024 presidential race Jim rudenberg a times writer at
0:26
large is our guest
0:36
it's Monday April [Music]
0:43
1st Jim NBC News just went through a very public a very searing drama over
0:49
the past week that we wanted you to make sense of in your unique capacity as a
0:54
longtime media and political reporter at the times this is your sweet spot you
1:00
were I believe born to dissect the story for us
1:06
brother well on the one hand this is a very small moment for a major Network
1:11
like NBC they hire as a contributor not an anchor not a correspondent as a
1:16
contributor Ronda McDaniel the former RNC chairwoman it blows up in a mini
1:22
scandal at the network but to me it represents a much larger issue that's been there since that moment Donald J
1:28
Trump took his shiny gold escalator later down to announce his presidential run in 2015 this struggle by the news
1:35
media to figure out especially on television how do we capture him cover him for all of his lies all the
1:41
challenges he poses to democratic Norms yet not alienate some 74 75 million
1:49
American voters who still follow him still believe in him and still want to
1:56
hear his reality reflected in the news that they're listening to right which is about as gnarly a conundrum as anyone
2:04
has ever dealt with in the news media well it's proven so far unsolvable well let's use the story of
2:11
what actually happened with Ron McDaniel and NBC to to illustrate your point and
2:17
I think that means describing precisely what happened in this situation the
2:22
story starts out so simply it's such a basic thing that television networks do
2:29
as election get underway they want people who will reflect the two parties
2:34
they want Talking Heads they want insiders they want them on their payroll so they can rely on them whenever they
2:39
need them and they want them to be high level so they can speak with great knowledge about the two major candidates
2:45
right and rather than needing to beg these people to come on their show at 6 o'clock when they might be busy and it's not their full-time job they go off and
2:51
they basically put them on retainer for a bunch of money yeah and in this case here's this perfect scenario because
2:57
quite recently Ron and McD Daniel the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee through the Trump era most of
3:04
it is now out on the market she's actually recently been forced out of the party and all the networks are
3:10
interested because here's The consumate Insider from Trump World ready to get
3:16
snatched up under contract for the next election and can really represent this movement that they've been trying to
3:22
capture so NBC's key news Executives move pretty aggressively pretty swiftly
3:29
and they sign up for a $300,000 a year contributor's contract nice money if you
3:34
can get it not a millions of dollars that they pay their anchors but a very nice contract I'll take it you'll take it in the eyes of NBC execs she was
3:42
perfect because she can be on Meet the Press as a panelist she can help as they figure out some of their coverage they
3:49
have 24 hours a day to fill and right here's an official from the RNC right you can almost imagine the question that
3:54
would be asked to her it's 10 p.m. on Election night R what are the Trump people thinking right now they're
4:00
looking at the same number as you are that was good but that's exactly it and we all know it right this is
4:06
television in our current ERA so last Friday NBC makes what should be a routine announcement but one they're
4:12
very proud of that they've hired Ronda McDaniel and in a statement they say it couldn't be a more important moment to
4:18
have a voice like Ras on the team so all's good right except for there's a
4:23
flying the ointment because it turns out that Ronald McDaniel has been slated to
4:29
to appear on Meet the Press not as a paid NBC contributor but as the former recently ousted RNC chair with the Meet
4:36
the Press host Kristen Welker who's preparing to have a real tough interview with Ron McDaniel because of course Ron
4:44
McDaniel was chair of the party and at Trump's side as he tried to refuse his
4:50
election loss so this was supposed to be a showdown interview from NBC News in
4:56
Washington the longest running show in television history this is Meet the Press with Kristen Welker and here all
5:04
of the sudden Kristen Welker is thrown for a loop in full disclosure to our viewers this interview was scheduled
5:10
weeks before it was announced that McDaniel would become a paid NBC News contributor because now she's actually
5:16
interviewing a member of the family who's on the same payroll right suddenly she's interviewing a colleague this will
5:21
be a news interview and I was not involved in her hiring so what happens during the interview so Welker is
5:28
prepared for tough interview and that's exactly what she does can you say as you sit here today did Joe Biden win the
5:34
election fair and square he won he's the legitimate s fair and square he won it's certified it's done she presses her on
5:41
the key question that a lot of Republicans get asked these days do you accept Joe Biden was the winner of the
5:47
election why you to say that why has it taken you until now to be able to say
5:53
I'm going to push back a little McDaniel gets defensive at times because I do think it's fair to say there were
5:58
problems in 2020 and to say that does not mean he's not the leg when you say that it suggests that there was
6:05
something wrong with the election and you know that the election was the most heavily scrutinized Chris KB it's a really combative interview I want to
6:12
turn now to your actions in the aftermath of the 2020 election and Welker actually really does go deeply
6:19
into McDaniel's record in those weeks before January 6 on November 17th you
6:25
and Donald Trump were recorded pushing two Republican Michigan election officials not to certify the results of
6:32
the election and I'll call for instance she presses McDaniel on McDaniel's role in an attempt to convince a couple
6:38
County Commissioner level canvassers in Michigan to not certify Biden's Victory
6:44
our call that night was to say are you okay vote your conscience not pushing
6:49
them to do anything and then McDaniel says look I was just telling them to vote their conscience they should do
6:55
whatever they think is right but you said do not sign it you can go home tonight do not sign it how can people
7:02
read that is anything other than a pressure campaign no the pressure and Welker's not going to just
7:09
let her off the hook Welker presses her on Trump's own comments about January 6 and and Trump's efforts recently to
7:16
gloss over some of the violence and to say that those who've been arrested he'll free them do you support that I
7:23
want to be very clear the violence that happened on January 6th is unacceptable
7:29
and this is a frankly fascinating moment because you can hear McDaniel starting to if not quite reverse some of her
7:35
positions though in some cases she does that at least really soften her language it's almost as if she's switching
7:41
uniforms from the RNC one to an NBC one or almost like breaking from a role she was playing R why not speak out earlier
7:49
why just speak out about that now when you're the RNC chair you you kind of
7:54
take one for the whole team right now I get to be a little bit more myself right this is what she says hey you know what
8:00
sometimes is r in C chair you just have to take it for the team sometimes right what she's really saying is I did things
8:06
as chairwoman of the Republican National Committee that now that I no longer have that job I can candidly say I wished I
8:12
hadn't done which is very honest but it's also another way of saying I'm two faced or you know I was playing a
8:20
part R McDaniel thank you very much for here this
8:27
morning then something extraordinary happens and I have to say I've never seen A Moment Like This in decades of
8:35
watching television news and covering television news welcome back the panel is here Chuck Todd NBC News Chief
8:40
political analyst Kimberly Welker brings her regular panel on including Chuck Todd now the senior NBC political
8:47
analyst Chuck let's Dive Right In what were your takeaways and he launches right into what he calls look let me
8:53
deal with the elephant in the room the elephant being this hiring of mcdang I think our bosses owe you an apology for
8:59
putting you in this situation and he proceeds on NBC's air to lace into
9:05
management for as he describes it putting Welker in this crazy awkward
9:10
position because I don't know what to believe she is now a paid contributor by NBC News I have no idea whether any
9:17
answer she gave to you was because she didn't want to mess up her contract and Todd is very hung up on this idea that
9:25
when she was speaking for the party she would say one thing and now that she's on the p Ro at NBC she's saying another
9:30
thing she has credibility issues that she still has to deal with is she speaking for herself or is she speaking
9:36
on behalf of who's paying her Todd is basically saying how are we supposed to know which one to believe right what can
9:42
we believe it is important for this network and for always to have a wide aperture having ideological diversity on
9:50
this panel is something I prided myself on we take you and what he's effectively saying is that his bosses should have
9:57
never hired her in this capacity Network I understand the motivation but this
10:03
execution I think was poor someone said to me last night we live in complicated times thank you guys for being here I
10:08
really appreciate it now let's just note here this isn't just any player at NBC
10:14
Chuck Todd is obviously a major news name at the network and him doing this
10:20
appears to open the floodgates across the entire NBC News brand especially on
10:26
its sister cable network MSNBC and where I said I'd never seen anything like what
10:31
I saw Meet the Press that morning I'd never seen anything like this either cuz now the entire MSNBC lineup is an open
10:39
Rebellion I mean from the minute that the sun comes up there is Joe SCB mik brazinski we
10:47
weren't asked our opinion of the hiring but if we were we would have strongly objected to it for several reason they're on fire over this we believe NBC
10:54
News should seek out Conservative Republican voices but it should be conservative Republicans not a person
11:02
who used her position of power to be an anti-democracy election denier and we
11:08
hope but it rolls out across the entire schedule because R McDaniel has been a
11:14
major pedler of the big lie Joy Reed tell you the fact that Miss McDaniel is on the payroll at NBC news to me that is
11:22
inexplicable I mean you wouldn't hire a mobster to work at a DA's office right
11:28
Rachel mat devotes an entire half hour it's not about just being associated
11:33
with Donald Trump and his time in the Republican party it's not even about lying or not lying it's about our system
11:39
of government thumbing her noses at her bosses and basically accusing them of abetting a traitorous figure in American
11:47
history I mean just extraordinary stuff it's television
11:54
[Music] history and let's face it we journalists
12:00
our bosses know we can be seen as crybabies and we're paid complain that's what we're paid to do but in this case
12:07
the NBC Executives cannot ignore this because in the outcry there's a very
12:12
clear point that they're all making Ronda McDaniel is not just a voice from the other side she was a fundamental
12:20
part of Trump's efforts to deny his election loss mhm this is not inviting
12:26
the other side this is someone who's on the wrong side of History of history of these moments that we've covered and are
12:31
still covering right and I think it's fair to say that at this point everyone understands that Ronald McDaniel's time at NBC News is going to be very
12:38
shortlived yeah basically after all this the executives at NBC have to face facts
12:43
it's over and on Tuesday night they release a statement to the staff saying
12:48
as much they don't cite the questions about red lines or what R McDaniel
12:53
represented or didn't represent they just say we need to have a unified Newsroom we want cohesion this isn't
13:00
working I think in the end she was a paid contributor for 4 days yeah one of the shortest Tangers in television news
13:08
history and look in one Respect by their standards this is kind of a pretty small contract a few hundred, they may have to
13:14
pay out but it was way more costly because they hired her they brought her
13:19
on board because they wanted to appeal to these tens of millions of Americans who still love Donald J
13:27
Trump and what happens now is that this entire thing is blown up in their face
13:32
and those very same people now see a network that in their view in the view of Republicans across the country this
13:38
network will not accept any Republican so it becomes more about that and Fox News NBC's longtime rival goes wall to
13:46
wall with this now NBC News just cave to the breathless demands from their
13:51
far-left frankly emotionally unhinged host I mean I had it on my desk all day and every minute I looked at that screen
13:59
it was pounding on these liberals at NBC News driving this Republican out it's
14:04
the shortest tenure in TV history I think but why well because she supports
14:09
Donald Trump period so in a way this leaves NBC worse off with that Trump
14:17
Republican audience they had wanted to court than maybe even they were before
14:23
it's like a boomerang with a Grenade on it yeah like it completely explodes in their face and that that's why to me the
14:30
whole episode is so representative of this 8year conundrum for the news media
14:38
especially on television they still haven't been able to crack the code for
14:43
how to handle the Trump movement the Trump candidacy and what it has wrought
14:49
on the American political system and American
14:55
[Music] journalism
15:02
we'll be right back Jim put into context this painful
15:07
episode of NBC into that larger conundrum you just diagnosed that the
15:13
media has faced when it comes to Trump well Michael it's been there from the
15:18
very beginning from the very beginning of his political rise the media was on this kind of seesaw you know they go
15:24
back and forth over how to cover him sometimes they want to cover him quite
15:29
aggressively because he's such a challenging candidate he was bursting so many Norms but at other times there was
15:36
this instinct to understand his appeal for the same reason he's such an unusual
15:42
candidate so there was a great desire to really understand his voters and frankly
15:47
to speak to his voters because they're part of the audience and we all lived it right but just let me take you back
15:54
anyway because everything's fresh again with perspective and so if you go back you know let's look at when he first ran
16:01
the networks if you recall saw him as almost like a novelty candidate he was going to spice up what was expected to
16:08
be a boring campaign between The Usual Suspects and he was a ratings magnet and
16:14
the networks they just couldn't get enough of it and they allowed him at times to really shatter their own Norms
16:20
welcome back to Meet the Press sir good morning Chuck good morning let me start he was able to just call into the studio
16:25
and riff with the the likes of George Stephanopoulos Chuck Todd can be true what does it have to do with she can't
16:32
talk about me because nobody respects women more than Donald Trump and I'm and
16:38
CNN gave him a lot of unmitigated airtime if if you recall during the campaign when they would run the press
16:44
conferences it's the largest Winery on the East Coast I own it 100% no and let
16:49
him promote his Trump stakes and his Trump wine Trump Stakes where are the stakes do we have Stakes I mean it got
16:55
that crazy but again the ratings were huge and then he wins and because they had
17:05
previously given him all that airtime they've in retrospect sort of given him a political gift and more than that now
17:12
have a journalistic imperative to really address him in a different way to cover
17:18
him as they would have covered any other candidate which let's face it they weren't doing initially so there's sort
17:24
of this extra motivation to make up for lost ground and maybe for some journalistic omissions right kind of
17:31
correct for the lack of a rigorous journalistic filter in the campaign
17:38
exactly and the big thing that this will be a remember for us we're going to call a lie alive I don't want to sugarcoat
17:44
this because facts matter and the fact is President Trump lies he
17:49
Li Trump lies we're going to say it's a lie and I think we can't just me Sur it
17:54
because they are lies and so we need to call them what they are and I we're no longer going to use euphemisms or you
18:01
know loser language we're going to call it for what it is Trump lies in tweets he spreads false information at rallies
18:07
he lies when he doesn't need to you know he he lies when the truth is more than enough for him CNN was running chirons
18:15
that would fact check Trump and call lies lies on the screen while Trump is talking they were challenging Trump to
18:21
his face one of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign in the midterms that here we go that well
18:29
if you don't mind Mr President that this Caravan was an invasion in these crazy press conferences they're hundreds of
18:35
miles away though they're hundreds and hundreds of miles away that that's not an invasion honestly I think you should
18:40
let me run the country you run CNN and if you did it well your ratings let me ask if I may ask one other question Mr
18:47
President if I may ask one other question are you worried that's enough that's enough president and Trump is giving it right back I'll tell you what
18:54
CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them you are rude
18:59
terrible person you shouldn't be working for CNN very
19:04
[Music]
19:10
combative so this was this incredibly fraught moment for the American Press
19:17
you've got tens of millions of trump supporters seeing what's really basic factchecking these look like attacks to
19:22
Trump supporters Trump in turn is calling the press the reporters are enemies of the people so it's a terrible
19:29
Dynamic mhm and when January 6 happens it's so obviously out of control and
19:35
with the traditional press that follows traditional journalistic rules has to do is make it clear that the claims that
19:41
Trump is making about a stolen election are just so abjectly false that they
19:47
don't warrant a single minute of real consideration once the reporting has been done to show how false they are and
19:55
I think that American journalism really emerged from that feeling strongly about its own values and its own place in
20:02
society but then you know there's still tens of millions of trump voters and
20:08
they don't feel so good about the coverage and they don't agree that January 6 was an Insurrection and so we
20:16
enter yet another period where the Press is going to have to now maybe rethink
20:22
some things in what way well there's a kind of quiet period after January 6
20:28
Trump is off of social media the smoke is literally dissipating from the air in
20:34
Washington and news executives are kind of standing there on you know the
20:39
proverbial Battlefield taking a new sort of look at their situation and they're
20:45
seeing that in this clearer light they've got some new problems perhaps
20:50
none more important for their entire business models than that their ratings
20:55
are quickly crashing and part of that diminishment is that a huge part of the
21:01
country that Trump loving part of the audience is really now severed from from
21:08
their coverage they see the press as actually in some cases being complicit
21:14
in stealing an election and so these news Executives again especially on television which is so ratings dependent
21:21
they've got a problem so after presumably learning all these lessons
21:26
about journalism and how to confront power there's a first subtle and then
21:32
much less subtle rethinking maybe we need to pull back from that approach and maybe we need to take some new lessons
21:39
and switch it up a little bit and reverse some of what we did and one of the best examples of this is none other
21:46
than CNN it had come Under New Management was
21:51
being led by a guy named Chris lick a veteran of cable news but also Steven CO's late night show been his last job
21:58
and his new job under this new management is we're going to recalibrate a little bit so Chris lick proceeds to
22:05
try to bring the network back to the center and how does he do that well we
22:12
see some key personalities who sort of represented the Trump combat Era start
22:18
losing air time and some of them lose their jobs there's talk of we want more Republicans on the air there was a
22:25
famous magazine article about Chris Lick's balancing act here and Chris lick says to a reporter Tim albera of the
22:32
Atlantic magazine look a lot in the media including at his own network quote unquote put on a jersey took a side they
22:40
took a side and he says I think we understand that Jersey cannot go back on
22:46
because he says in the end of the day by the way it didn't even work we didn't change anyone's
22:55
mind he's saying that confrontational approach Ro that defined the four years
23:01
Trump was in office that was a reaction to the feeling that TV news had failed to
23:06
properly treat Trump with sufficient skepticism that that actually was a
23:12
failure both of Journalism and of the TV news business is that what he's saying
23:19
yeah on the business side it's easier call right you want a bigger audience
23:25
and you're not getting the bigger audience but he's making a journalistic argument as well that if the job is to
23:31
convey the truth and take it to the people so that they and they take that into account as they make their own
23:36
voting decisions and formulate their own opinions about American politics if tens
23:41
of millions of people who do believe that election was stolen are completely tuning you out because now they see you
23:47
as a political combatant you're not achieving your ultimate goal as a journalist and what does licks don't put
23:52
a jersey back on approach look like on CNN for its viewers wow it didn't look
24:00
good people might remember this but the most glaring example please welcome the
24:06
front runner for the Republican nomination former president Donald
24:11
Trump was when he held a town hall meeting featuring Donald J Trump now
24:18
candidate Trump before an audience packed with Trump's fans when you look at what happened during that election uh
24:24
unless you're a very stupid person you see what happens a lot of the people Trump let loose a string of falsehoods
24:31
most people understand what happened that was a rigged election the audience this prot Trump audience was cheering
24:37
him on are you ready are you ready can I talk yeah what's the answer can do you mind I would like for you to answer the
24:43
question okay it's very simple to answer that's why I asked it it's very simple to you're a nasty person I'll tell
24:49
you and jering the CNN anchor hosting this Caitlyn Collins right on CNN's own
24:55
air it was it was a disaster right it felt like a call back to to the unlearned lessons of 2016 yeah and in
25:02
this case CNN staff was up in arms big shake up in the cable news industry as
25:07
CNN makes another change at the top Chris lick is officially out at CNN after a chaotic run as chairman and CEO
25:15
and Chris didn't survive it the chief executive's departure comes as he faced criticism in recent weeks after the
25:21
network hosted a town hall with Donald Trump and the Network's ratings started to drop but I want to say that the CNN
25:29
leadership still even after that as they brought new leadership in said this is still the path we're going to go on
25:35
maybe that didn't work out but we're still here this is still what we have to do right and this idea is very much in
25:40
the water of TV news that this is the right overall direction yeah this is by
25:46
no means isolated to CNN this is throughout the traditional news business these conversations are happening everywhere but CNN was living it at that
25:54
point and this of course is how we get to NBC deciding to hire Rana McDaniel right cuz
26:02
they're picking up right where that conversation leaves off they're having the same conversation but for NBC You
26:08
could argue this tension between journalistic values and audience it's even more pressing because even though
26:13
MSNBC is a niche cable network NBC News is part of an old-fashioned broadcast
26:19
network it's on television stations throughout the country and in fact those networks they still have 6:30 newscasts
26:26
and believe it or not millions of people still watch those every night maybe not
26:32
as many as they used to but there's still some six or seven million people right tuning in tonightly news that's
26:37
important right we should say that kind of number is sometimes double or triple that of the cable news Prime Time shows
26:44
that get all the attention on their best nights so this is this is big business still and that business is based on
26:51
Broad it's called broadcast for a reason that's based on Broad audiences so NBC
26:57
had a business imperative and they argue they had a journalistic imperative mhm so given all
27:04
of that Jim I think the big messy question here is when it comes to
27:10
NBC did they make a tactical error around hiring the wrong Republican which
27:16
blew up or did they make an even larger error in
27:21
thinking that the way you handle Trump and his supporters is to work this hard
27:27
to reach them when they might not even be reachable the best way to answer that
27:34
question is to tell you what they're saying right now NBC management what Management's saying is yes this was a
27:40
tactical error this was clearly the wrong Republican we get it m but they're
27:46
saying we are going to and they said this in their statement announcing that they were severing ties with McDaniel
27:52
they said we're going to redouble our efforts to represent a broad spectrum of the American voter ship and that's what
27:59
they meant was that we're going to we're going to still try to reach these Trump voters with people who can relate to
28:06
them and they can relate to but the question is how do you even do that when so many of his supporters believe a lie
28:12
how is NBC how is CNN how are any of these TV networks if they have decided
28:17
that this is their mission how are they supposed to speak to people who believe something fundamentally untrue as a core
28:27
part of their po political identity that's the Catch 22 how do you
28:32
get that Trump movement person who's also an Insider when the lip Miss test to be an Insider in the Trump movement
28:39
is to believe in the denialism OR at least say you do so that's a real
28:45
journalistic problem and and the thing that we haven't really touched here is what are these networks doing day in and
28:51
day out they're not producing reported pieces which I where I think it's a little easier you just report the news
28:58
you go out into the world talk to people and then you present it to the world as a nuanced portrait of the country right
29:04
this thing is true this thing is false again in many cases pretty straightforward but their bread and
29:10
butter is Talking Heads it's live it's not edited it's not that much reported
29:16
so their whole business model especially again on cable which has 24 hours to fill is Talking Heads and if you want
29:22
the perspective from the Trump movement journalistically especially when it
29:27
comes to denialism but when it comes to some other major subjects in American life you're walking into a place where
29:34
they're going to say things that aren't true that don't pass your journalistic standards the most basic standards of
29:39
journalism right so you're saying if TV sticks with this model the kind of
29:45
lowcost lots of talk approach to news then they are going to have to Solve the
29:51
Riddle of who to bring on who represents Trump's America if they want that
29:57
audience and now they've got this red line that they've established that that
30:02
person can't be someone who denies the 2020 election reality but like you just
30:07
said that's the litmus test for being in Trump's orbit so this doesn't really
30:13
look like a conundrum this looks like a bit of a crisis for TV news because it may end up meaning that they can't hire
30:20
that person that they need for this model which means that perhaps a network like NBC does need to wave goodbye to a
30:27
big seg M of these viewers and these eyeballs who support Trump I mean on the
30:32
one hand they are not ready to do that and they would never concede that that's something they're ready to do the
30:38
problem is barring some kind of change in their news model there's no solution to this but why bar changes to their
30:45
news model I guess is the question because over the years it's gotten more
30:50
and more expensive to produce news the news that I'm talking about like recorded packages and and what we refer
30:57
to is reporting just go out and Report the news don't gab about it just what's going on what's true what's false that's
31:04
actually very expensive in television and they don't have the kind of money they used to have so the Talking Heads
31:10
is their way to do programming at a level where they can afford it they do some packages 60 Minutes still does
31:15
incredible work NBC does packages but but the line share what they do is what we're talking about and that's not going
31:20
to change because the economics aren't there MH so then a final option of course to borrow something Chris lck
31:27
said is that a network like NBC perhaps doesn't put a jersey on but
31:36
accepts the reality that a lot of the world sees them wearing a
31:42
jersey yeah I mean nobody wants to be seen as wearing a jersey in our business
31:48
no one wants to be wearing a jersey in our business but maybe what they really have to accept is that we're just
31:54
sticking to the true facts and that may look like we're wearing a jersey but we're not and that may at times look
32:00
like it's lining up more with the Democrats but we're not if Trump is lying about a stolen
32:07
election that's not sighing against him that's ciding for the truth and that's what we're
32:12
doing easier said than done and I don't think any of these concepts are new I think there have been attempts to do
32:18
that but it's the world they're in and it's the only option they really
32:24
have we're going to tell you the truth even if it means that we're going to
32:30
lose a big part of the
