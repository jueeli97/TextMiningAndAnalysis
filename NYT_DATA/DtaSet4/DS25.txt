Why Donald Trump Won Nevada Before Any Votes Were Cast


0:01
[Music]
0:03
so historically out of the four early
0:06
voting states in the presidential
0:07
nominating process Nevada often gets the
0:10
least amount of
0:12
attention it's way out in the west far
0:15
from Washington DC and in recent history
0:18
the state has voted by caucus a method
0:21
that has long been criticized for
0:22
limiting who can vote because generally
0:25
people have to show up in person at a
0:27
specific time so after 2020 and more of
0:31
that criticism State officials decided
0:34
to scrap the caucus and hold a
0:36
primary the Democrats complied and
0:39
President Biden is expected to win that
0:41
primary today without much competition
0:44
on the Republican side however the Trump
0:47
campaign exerted pressure on Republican
0:49
officials in the state to hold a
0:51
separate caucus a method that seen is
0:54
more beneficial to Trump and the state
0:56
party decided to do that and to make the
0:58
caucus winner not the primary winner the
1:01
official recipient of the state's
1:03
presidential delegates effectively
1:05
making Nevada switch to a primary
1:08
meaningless and guaranteeing that Trump
1:10
would leave the state one step closer to
1:12
the nomination so when Trump said this
1:15
in New Hampshire next week it's Nevada
1:17
it's not South Carolina we love South
1:18
Carolina but next week it's Nevada and
1:21
I'm pleased to announce we just won
1:24
Nevada just
1:26
100% he was basically right all of them
1:29
from New York Times I'm a hearnen this
1:32
is the
1:35
runup to understand that more I called
1:38
up my colleague Jenny Medina Jenny it's
1:40
good to see you can you tell me where
1:42
you are right now and then tell me where
1:44
you were four years ago with me at this
1:47
time right now I'm in my house in Los
1:49
Angeles but around this time last four
1:52
years ago we were definitely in Las
1:53
Vegas she's based in California and
1:56
reports on politics and voters with a
1:59
specific Focus focus on the west combing
2:01
the strip and really combing Off the
2:03
Strip looking for election stories right
2:06
right right we were doing journalism by
2:08
day and hanging at the cosmo by night if
2:10
I remember
2:13
correctly Peak campaign Trail fun it
2:16
doesn't get any better so in today's
2:19
Republican primary it's Nikki Haley and
2:21
a whole bunch of randoms Where's Donald
2:23
Trump Donald Trump does not come until
2:25
Thursday on Thursday the state party
2:28
will have a caucus and people who want
2:31
to vote will show up in gyms and in
2:33
ballrooms across the state and say they
2:36
support Donald Trump but he's the only
2:38
player there and that caucus is arguably
2:41
the the election that really matters
2:43
because all the delegates will be
2:44
decided based on what happens there so
2:46
what I'm hearing from you is that Trump
2:49
kind of went through a whole separate
2:50
process and is now virtually guaranteed
2:53
to win all of the state's delegates when
2:56
it relates to the Republican nomination
2:57
that's right how did he pull that off
2:59
you know Trump has got a lot of allies
3:02
and he certainly has a lot of allies in
3:03
this state party the Nevada party has
3:06
been sort of on his side and loyal to
3:08
him for a long time he cultivated that
3:11
his campaign created these conditions
3:13
long ago kind of before most people
3:16
certainly most of the national press was
3:18
paying attention he just made it happen
3:21
we've talked to some of our colleagues
3:23
including Maggie Haberman and Jonathan
3:24
Swan about how this version of the Trump
3:27
campaign might be a little more
3:28
organized than the previous version of
3:30
the Trump campaign what I hear from you
3:31
is kind of another example of that it
3:33
sounds like the Trump campaign virtually
3:36
bullied the state party into doing
3:37
exactly what it wants and frankly the
3:39
other candidates couldn't stop him
3:41
that's right I mean Ron santis when he
3:43
was still in the race had said he was
3:46
going to participate in the caucus Nikki
3:48
Haley had always said that she was going
3:50
to participate in the primary but yes
3:53
Trump got exactly what he wanted and
3:55
even the governor who is a Republican
3:57
and is a trump supporter has endorsed
3:59
Trump
4:00
has voiced his disappointment with the
4:02
way that this is how it's playing out
4:04
wow okay since Donald Trump is kind of
4:06
correct and this caucus does have a
4:08
result where we know who the winner is
4:10
let's focus on some different things we
4:12
can think about when it relates to
4:14
Nevada of course this is a different
4:15
type of State than we saw earlier in
4:18
Iowa and New Hampshire and places that I
4:19
had spend a lot of time reporting I
4:21
haven't been out to Nevada so you tell
4:22
me what's the difference between a
4:24
Nevada voter and an Iowa New Hampshire
4:25
voter I think the biggest difference is
4:27
that both Iowa and New Hampshire are
4:30
overwhelmingly white voters and Nevada
4:33
is a much more diverse State more than
4:35
20% of Voters there are Hispanic there's
4:38
a significant black voting population a
4:40
significant Asian population and a very
4:43
significant young population and even
4:46
more than young people move in and out
4:48
of Nevada very quickly so a transient
4:51
State very transient and one of the
4:53
things you always hear when you talk to
4:55
political organizers and strategists is
4:57
that they don't know who their body of
4:59
voter voters is voters who voted in 2020
5:02
are very different than voters who voted
5:03
in 2016 and will be very different than
5:06
voters who vote in 2024 you know another
5:08
difference that jumps out to me is that
5:10
Nevada is a Battleground State when we
5:12
think of the general election whereas
5:14
Iowa and New Hampshire are less so what
5:16
Clues do we have right now about who the
5:18
most important voting block would be
5:20
come November when it comes to a
5:21
presidential contest which is likely to
5:23
be a rematch between Trump and Biden
5:25
yeah I mean Nevada for a while Obama won
5:27
Nevada and for a while people thought of
5:29
Nevada as being a blue state but anybody
5:32
who spends time there really does think
5:34
of it as a purple State and a constant
5:36
Battleground State and I think that's
5:38
even more true this year why I would say
5:41
the two big populations are Latino
5:44
voters and working class voters and
5:46
there's a really big overlap between
5:48
those two Nevada is a place that has a
5:50
lot of people who aren't college
5:51
educated who consider themselves working
5:53
class who vote the unions play a huge
5:56
role in that and Hispanic voters we
6:00
already know that Democrats have lost
6:01
ground with Hispanic voters over the
6:03
last several election cycles and this is
6:06
a big test sort of how much ground can
6:08
they make up can they gain ground or are
6:10
they going to lose more ground that
6:12
gives us two good populations to look
6:14
for I mean I remember the importance of
6:16
kind of appealing to workingclass
6:17
Latinos that both Democrats and
6:19
Republicans have put a focus on in the
6:21
state but you've uniquely focused on
6:23
Latino voters in the last couple years
6:25
what questions do you have at the start
6:28
of this race when it comes to that
6:30
population in the general election what
6:31
should we be looking for when it comes
6:33
to the very broad very unnuanced term of
6:36
the Latino vote I mean I think there's a
6:38
few different things one that constantly
6:42
comes to mind is gender you know how
6:44
much of this is going to be driven by
6:45
men and how much do women also get on
6:49
board on the Trump on Trump board or on
6:51
Biden's board um I think young people
6:54
sort of how much young people are
6:56
enthusiastic or not and do they want to
6:58
stay home or not I think sort of overall
7:01
I'm really wondering like what's the
7:03
level of enthusiasm for politics now one
7:06
of the things we know is that Trump
7:07
activated Latino voters who had not
7:10
voted previously and who just decided
7:12
for the first time here's a guy who
7:14
looks interesting enough that I want to
7:16
vote for him yeah so let's talk about
7:19
some of the specific reporting you've
7:20
been doing around these questions I know
7:22
that you recently made a trip to Nevada
7:24
with our colleague Alisa Gutierrez to
7:26
talk with some Latino men specifically
7:28
about how they're feeling around the
7:30
question around Trump and Biden can you
7:32
tell me about that reporting sure I
7:35
first came across a barber shop in East
7:37
Las Vegas when I was out in the area in
7:40
2022 trying to understand this very
7:42
question sort of how endangered were
7:45
Democrats in the state and I met these
7:47
two guys who had owned a barber shop for
7:50
more than 20 years together one of them
7:53
considered himself a pretty DieHard
7:55
Democrat although he had a lot of
7:57
frustrations with the party and and the
7:59
other guy had voted for Democrats in the
8:01
past but had become pretty devoted to
8:03
Trump and these were two guys who I just
8:06
thought were pretty fascinating and
8:09
interacted and sort of debated and
8:11
sparred with each other about their
8:13
politics all the time and I when given
8:16
the chance wanted to go back to their
8:18
place and see what the atmosphere of the
8:20
shop was like where am I going you're on
8:22
here for 1.7 miles taking exit 73 thank
8:25
you let me just say Logistics really
8:27
quick the shop caters in entirely to men
8:30
and mostly Hispanic
8:32
[Music]
8:34
men I wonder how busy they are today he
8:37
said Thursday Friday Saturdays are the
8:39
biggest day so that was part of makes
8:41
sense people are trying to look good for
8:43
the weekend and on the front window of
8:45
the barber shop it has a a painting of
8:48
the old Barber pool oh that's
8:50
interesting the working
8:52
class on their uh oh yeah in the classic
8:55
like Barber Shop sort of like spinning a
8:58
painted spinning
9:00
that says the working class someone and
9:03
most of these guys you know a lot of
9:05
them work as cops a lot of them work in
9:08
the casinos a lot of them work as
9:11
servers and they're all there to kind of
9:13
yes get their haircut but also relax and
9:16
part of relaxing is like shooting the
9:17
and and politics comes up basically
9:21
all the time now no what's up ladies how
9:23
you guys doing today and part of that is
9:26
is Danny Danny is one of the owners who
9:28
is a trump guy and Danny really has a
9:32
good time and he's conspiracy theorist
9:34
so you might get some real uh crazy deep
9:38
uh deep what's that called the dark
9:40
internet no I just question everything
9:42
yeah the dark some really dark web
9:43
answers like entertains himself by being
9:46
provocative by like kind of teasing
9:48
people and and talking about sort of
9:51
what he thinks might offend or shock or
9:55
just things that he thinks people will
9:57
enjoy that's why I think a lot of the
9:59
black lives matter a lot of the
10:00
political sociological problems that are
10:02
happening we have that happen here
10:04
everybody here the main the main color
10:05
is green money you know every barber
10:09
shop has one Barber who is purely there
10:11
to start stuff that is definitely Danny
10:15
so Danny you know he does it all the
10:18
time and he loves he kind of has really
10:21
taken great pride and joy and being the
10:24
Trump guy now and it turns out as we
10:27
found most most of the guys in there
10:30
actually agree with him or at least most
10:31
of the guys who are talking about
10:33
politics agree with him the people who
10:35
told us they plan to vote this year most
10:38
of them said they plan to vote for
10:40
Trump interesting why the wise are
10:43
pretty complicated it's tough to see
10:45
what's going to happen in everything
10:48
right in just the world in general
10:50
there's a lot of things going on that we
10:52
have no control
10:53
over so it's tough I mean a lot of these
10:58
guys have pretty dark dark visions of
11:00
what the world looks like now of what
11:01
the United State looks like now my my
11:03
youngest 32 don't want kids she says she
11:06
ain't bringing no kids in this damn
11:08
world good for her they feel like
11:10
there's nothing in it for them there's
11:12
no way for them to get ahead they're
11:14
very worried about their kids being able
11:16
to achieve or or to get the same kind of
11:20
things that they had in terms of like a
11:22
house or trappings of the middle class
11:25
so does she have a better Economic
11:26
Opportunity than you did absolutely not
11:29
absolutely no one does right now no one
11:32
does we got actors they also feel like
11:35
very attacked I mean one of the things
11:36
that kept coming up again and again is
11:38
how woke our society is now you say the
11:41
wrong thing right now no they're not
11:42
even woke they're s what does that mean
11:44
that mean everybody's looking to be
11:46
offended everybody want if they say
11:48
something to their kids their kids will
11:49
be offended this sort of feeling that
11:52
like the ground is changing underneath
11:54
them and there's nothing they can do to
11:55
stop it and this feeling of you know
11:58
that Trump is
12:00
somehow an avatar for what is possible
12:03
in this country these are little things
12:06
that regular person has not the
12:08
financial meanss to
12:10
do said regular person you guys were
12:15
both like yes I'm so glad Trump is
12:18
running Trump's not a regular
12:22
person he is a regular person the fact
12:24
that you can as an individual become
12:26
successful just like he do if you know
12:29
how to that his success is their success
12:32
that he shows anybody can do it there's
12:35
just a lot of excitement there's a lot
12:38
of desire for like what do we have to
12:40
lose let's blow up the system isn't
12:42
working for us let's blow it up with
12:44
this guy anyway Shake Up America that's
12:47
why you get to get it all these all
12:48
these ones that are sof out there shake
12:50
them up you better act right because the
12:52
big Uncle Uncle Uncle uh Uncle Trump
12:55
might be coming
12:57
back and these are guys Danny included
13:01
who really believe in the lift yourself
13:03
up by your bootstraps who think their
13:05
parents did it my grandfather was an
13:07
attorney during the baradero program
13:10
ambassad program he'd come pick fruit
13:13
for 3 months and made more during that
13:16
time than in the attorney in Mexico who
13:18
think they've basically done it for
13:19
their kids do you think your kids are
13:22
having a better life than you had do you
13:24
think your grandkid will have a better
13:25
life because of me though cuz of me and
13:27
my wife and you want their kids to be
13:29
able to do it for their grandkids like
13:30
they really truly believe it and that's
13:33
what they are most concerned with what
13:36
one of the first times I ever talked to
13:37
Danny he made it clear like we live in
13:39
Vegas we know better than anybody money
13:42
is what makes the world go around yeah I
13:44
think that was one of the big takeaways
13:46
in the 2020 election when you did see
13:48
Trump improve his numbers specifically
13:50
with some portions of the Latino
13:51
electorate their concerns actually
13:53
pretty much align things like a LW of
13:55
American dream or a focus on the economy
13:57
or even some concerns about changing
14:00
language and culture that s sounds kind
14:02
of trumpy even if it's coming from an
14:04
unexpected Source yeah and these guys
14:06
just to be clear most of these guys who
14:08
I'm talking about in this shop for
14:10
example are not red hat mea wearers you
14:14
know they are not people who are who are
14:16
super devoted to the Trump cause they're
14:18
not going to rallies they're not Flying
14:21
Flags off the back of their truck but
14:23
there're people who just feel like the
14:25
political system doesn't speak to me
14:27
doesn't speak for me or speak to me and
14:29
this guy does and they don't see him as
14:33
attacking them at all they don't feel
14:35
attacked they're like ah he's just
14:37
saying what he knows will work I like
14:39
Trump you know I like you got to admit
14:41
Trump keeps you entertained for
14:42
entertainment value I mean I mean it was
14:45
fun to just oh let see what this Fool's
14:46
going to say today I mean now now did he
14:48
have good policies of course but he had
14:49
bad ones he had good ones a lot of women
14:52
don't like him because of the dumb
14:53
he said you know grabbing Whatever by
14:55
whatever he didn't mean women he just
14:57
meant I'm grab him by his fo it is what
15:01
it is it's nothing it's a man thing and
15:03
he said the wrong thing at the wrong
15:05
time
15:07
and I mean it's interesting because In
15:09
that clip you hear someone who is not
15:13
only entertained by Trump but likes the
15:16
way that Trump offends people who he
15:19
thinks are too sensitive and you know
15:22
the quote that quote it's a man thing I
15:24
mean it can't get more literal than that
15:25
how much are you when you were there how
15:27
much of it was what we would call maybe
15:29
like traditional like you know maybe
15:32
masculine identification with Trump
15:34
versus more policy stuff like the
15:36
economy or other things that you have
15:37
mentioned previously I I think it's both
15:40
I think it's both and I've talked to a
15:42
lot of men in the past who have some
15:43
version of it Danny's a little bit more
15:45
colorful and straightforward in how he
15:47
says it but there's not an insignificant
15:50
number of men of Hispanic men who who
15:52
speak that way who talk that way about
15:54
Trump I think it would be wrong to say
15:57
that it is only about masculinity I
15:59
think it is also about like something
16:01
slightly deeper which is this feeling of
16:04
like I want to provide for my family
16:07
he's going to help me provide to my
16:09
family you know what I mean like I would
16:10
link those two things I think the
16:12
economy or the perception of the economy
16:15
and the masculinity thing goes hand
16:17
inand right it strikes me that Iowa New
16:19
Hampshire and South Carolina the early
16:21
states that get the most kind of
16:23
attention play into the traditional kind
16:26
of American dichotomy of really black
16:28
white electorate that you know when we
16:30
talk about race or when we talk about
16:32
people of color or we talk about new
16:34
demographics that really it's often the
16:36
kind of Democratic party leading with
16:39
black people which had traditionally
16:41
been the largest section of its base
16:44
when it comes to rational minorities you
16:45
know some of that is changing and it's
16:47
been a thing that we have covered for a
16:49
while did anyone there speak to the kind
16:52
of changing face of America and whether
16:54
they feel they're included in that yeah
16:57
it's really interesting I think the way
16:59
that a lot of these guys think about
17:01
this even if they don't say it exactly
17:03
this way is we're here get used to it
17:06
like they really conceive of themselves
17:09
as being Mexican or Hispanic or Latino
17:13
whatever the label they use that's like
17:15
an important part of their identity and
17:18
they totally think of themselves as
17:20
American and George talked about this
17:22
and how he thinks the party should be
17:24
thinking about Latinos who are the
17:26
largest non-white voting group in
17:27
America yeah I think the Democrats are
17:30
laying us down and they let us down why
17:32
do you that oh well it's obvious what's
17:34
been going on over the years they're not
17:36
doing nothing for us everything they do
17:38
is for the blacks and the white people
17:39
and that's it they if you let the news
17:41
tell it if you let the papers tell it
17:43
it's a black and white world and we're
17:45
not okay with that and the reason we're
17:46
not okay with that because we're the
17:48
biggest group in America we're the
17:50
biggest voting group if we stick
17:51
together we're the biggest voting group
17:54
we don't need to cater to nobody we can
17:56
we can determine who becomes president
17:58
or not but we're not United you know the
18:01
numbers don't lie I mean the last time
18:03
you on this show we were talking about
18:05
how the rise in terms of numbers of
18:07
Latinos or reshaping the political
18:10
landscape and the interest of both
18:11
parties there does seem to be a kind of
18:14
growing understanding that that
18:16
political power can be exerted both to
18:19
influence Democrats and Republicans
18:22
absolutely I think this person
18:24
absolutely understands that in a way
18:26
that I don't know that every voter does
18:28
does but certainly some people do and
18:31
that's where you get to this what do we
18:33
have to lose attitude they haven't done
18:35
anything for us how can we exert this
18:37
power that we have let's try anything
18:41
you know what can we possibly do what
18:44
George shows I think is like yes there
18:47
is definitely an element
18:50
of anti- wokeism and you know sort of
18:55
pro machismo or hyper masculinity there
18:58
is definitely that and there is
19:00
definitely the economic stuff as well
19:03
but what George says so clearly is like
19:07
who is looking out for us like that big
19:09
question who's looking out for us and he
19:12
doesn't see it in any in either party
19:16
but he goes to what do we have to lose
19:18
let me just try these Republicans and
19:20
see what they can do for me so we know
19:21
how Trump may try to appeal specifically
19:23
to groups like Latino men but when we
19:25
look ahead to the other side on what
19:27
Democrats might do what is the strategy
19:29
to kind of undo the feelings of
19:31
Abandonment that you heard in the barber
19:33
shop I mean the Democrats have taken
19:36
what seems to be a pretty
19:37
straightforward approach of trying to
19:39
remind people how terrible Trump is and
19:43
trying to remind people what Biden has
19:45
done but more of an emphasis on how
19:47
terrible Trump is and I think what you
19:51
see in these men is like that may not be
19:53
enough that that may not be effective I
19:55
think Democrats are going to spend a lot
19:57
of money on this group I think one of
19:59
the big questions is is spending money
20:01
to message and do Outreach in an
20:04
election enough or is it something
20:06
deeper than that is it some some real
20:09
change in policy a change in how the
20:11
government approaches dealing with what
20:14
these kinds of Voters want so Nevada
20:16
feels like a window into what we should
20:18
expect as this race between Biden and
20:20
Trump begins but is there anything that
20:21
we should be thinking about in the short
20:23
term in regards to the state or this
20:25
electorate that you know we might get
20:27
more lose that either Tuesday or
20:29
Thursday I mean I think the question of
20:32
who votes on Tuesday and Thursday is an
20:34
interesting one and one of the
20:35
demographics of those voters I mean the
20:38
thing that we heard a lot in the barber
20:40
shop from these Republican voters is
20:42
just this nihilism this feeling of like
20:44
nothing is going to get better and when
20:46
I was asking these guys I was there more
20:49
recently I was asking these guys hey are
20:50
you voting in the caucus or primary most
20:53
of them looked at me blankly they had no
20:55
idea it was even happening so they're
20:57
not feeling particularly reached out to
20:59
or tied into to the Republican party or
21:02
or even to Donald Trump but they all
21:05
feel pretty obligated or pretty
21:07
committed at least for now of voting in
21:09
November so seeing how that pessimism
21:13
works out is something I'm very curious
21:14
about well you'll be tracking it and
21:17
we'll be tracking you so that's helpful
21:19
Jenny have a great rest of your day
21:22
thank you you
21:27
too so as a refresher here's how it's
21:30
going to work if you're a republican
21:32
voter in Nevada and you've managed to
21:34
more or less figure out what's going on
21:36
this year you'll vote in the Tuesday
21:39
primary if you support Nikki Haley or
21:41
any of the alternative candidates on the
21:44
ballot but if you support Trump you'll
21:47
caucus for him on
21:48
Thursday where he's the only real
21:51
candidate and that's the only vote that
21:53
will matter when it comes to choosing
21:55
this year's Republican nominee
21:58
