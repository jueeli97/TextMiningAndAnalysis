‘What If Someone Dies?’ And Other 2024 Questions, Answered


0:10
this is Amy hi thank you so much for uh picking up and for more importantly
0:16
sending in a question to us can you first just tell me the question that you sent in to the
0:21
show yes so the thing I wanted to know given the age of the presumed candidat
0:28
what does happen if one or both of these candidates dies before the election I
0:34
know that sounds harsh but statistically speaking it's possible and then
0:39
what I guess like when did this question get on your radar I know that's a weird
0:48
way to ask it oh that's a good question I don't I I think because probably like a lot of
0:56
other people I this sounds weird but like just looking for a way out of this
1:02
and obviously by no unnatural ending I don't want that to happen to anyone but
1:07
I just thought is there any circumstance where it's just not Trump Biden again
1:13
just what is every possibility of what could happen to set this up any differently
1:20
whatsoever Amy is not alone for the past few months we've been asking our
1:26
listeners to send in questions and as November gets closer there's an
1:31
increasing sense of desperation reflected in these questions you're
1:36
asking about third party candidates Health emergencies criminal convictions
1:42
death things that could alter the inevitable rematch it kind of feels like as a
1:48
country we all fell asleep on the train and now the conductor is announcing that
1:54
you have to get off at the last stop that you have no other choice but this one and you have this moment of panic
2:02
you're like this is it this is my only [Music] option so today we take on your two
2:09
biggest 2024 questions what if something happens to Biden or Trump and is anyone else
2:17
coming from the New York Times I'm aad hearon this is the
2:23
[Music] runup yo what's up you're wearing a
2:29
you're wearing a t just for you just for you do I need to go change no I see in this morning to start
2:38
we turn to some highly qualified friends my name is Reed Epstein and I cover Joe
2:43
Biden's reelection campaign in the broader Democratic Universe for the New York Times in the time since Amy sent in
2:50
her question the age issue had only gotten more real scrutiny of President
2:55
Biden's age intensified after a recent special counsel report described him as
3:00
quote an elderly man with a poor memory I wondered how um in your work
3:06
reporting on the Biden campaign and the broad Democratic party how did that report land in Biden world and what's
3:13
the campaign's response been uh it landed like a ton of bricks right I
3:19
think of like the old Far Side cartoons where like an anvil would drop from a tree on somebody and it was kind of like
3:25
that um I'm glad I got that I was worried where I would go you know they were
3:30
furious at the inclusion of the broadsides against the president's
3:36
memory which they you know universally felt were out of bounds from uh his
3:42
assignment to determine whether charges should be brought against the president uh on the documents retention
3:49
issue and they were also you know mad at the coverage of the Special council's
3:55
Report uh you know we saw in the immediate aftermath the campaign blasted
4:02
reporters with the number of stories written about Biden's age compared to
4:08
stories about Donald Trump and they like were clearly taking this as a license to
4:15
go to war not just with the Attorney General's office which which they did but also the media for for covering what
4:22
the special counsel said M as this kind of new cycle on age was developing I
4:28
totally see how the Biden camp pain can make this arguments they made those arguments to us directly when we went to
4:33
Wilmington kind of saying that the concerns about Joe Biden's age were overblown and a kind of Insider
4:40
conversation I remember them framing it at the time rather than the ways that people are actually going to experience
4:45
the election but like there are voters who are concerned like the caller who sent in this question what is the
4:52
campaign doing about the legitimate voter issue regarding age looking ahead
4:57
to the summer and the fall well I think you're right you do not have to ask voters about Joe Biden's age um you know
5:05
I ask a lot of open-ended questions to people I talk to and like you usually starts with what do you think of Joe
5:11
Biden yeah and inevitably as you too the answer is he's so old I can't believe
5:17
he's running again I mean I will tell you this I was on vacation last year in Morocco and we were in a car being led
5:24
by a tour guide to the Sahara Desert and in that place the guy asked
5:30
we were talking about he was asking us what we do for a living and I told him I'm a reporter and he said of all the
5:36
people in America is there no one younger than 80 years old who can run for person
5:42
yeah and so this is is is a truly a global concern that people have about
5:48
him and so I don't believe that the media is
5:53
overplaying the issue and concern that voters have with Joe Biden's age I do
5:59
think that and we do know that the campaign is trying to reframe the age
6:06
question every day into a choice question between a return to Trump or
6:12
Joe Biden and not a referendum on Joe Biden in part because we have seen in
6:17
polling you know for years at this point that a referendum on Joe Biden alone the
6:24
president would almost certainly lose and so part of that is them pushing
6:29
stories about Trump being old too and when Trump said that Nikki Haley was in
6:35
charge of security on January 6th when he met Nancy Pelosi like they pushed
6:40
that on their social media platforms and they pushed that out to reporters and they tried to make that into a news
6:47
cycle about Trump's forgetfulness and his predilection for getting things
6:52
wrong while speaking to rallies and they're right that he does do that and he's 77 years old he's gotten a lot of
6:59
things wrong wrong as well but the fact of the matter is voters receive Trump
7:05
and Biden differently when it comes to their age and their Acuity and while
7:10
Trump is also slipping quite publicly that has not baked in for voters in the
7:17
same way that it has been for Biden I mean but that description of what you're saying the campaigns plan is
7:24
which just to reframe the age question into a choice question it it actually like go at the heart of what voters
7:32
think about the President right like is there any plans to put him out there more is there any plans to have him you
7:39
know talk you know I I was with someone yesterday who says that he should call his economic plan like Grandpa economics
7:46
and kind of embrace the older person kind of Mantra I I guess I'm wondering like is there any plans to legitimately
7:53
reframe him on his age rather than just say Donald Trump is also old I mean
7:58
they've gotten a a lot of advice along the grandpa economics lines uh you know I've talked with advisers to the
8:05
campaign donors to the campaign other Democratic elected officials and many of
8:10
them have offered unsolicited advice both directly to the campaign and
8:16
through the press to the campaign about how the President should lean into his
8:21
age is a way to answer that question they have not done that in part because
8:28
you know the president doesn't want to right like he doesn't want the age to be
8:33
an issue and so they haven't done it aside from you know he will make jokes
8:38
about you know when he was with the founding fathers but they don't engage in it in a
8:44
serious way the way that you know some of their allies would like them to and
8:50
that is you know has led to the scenario that we've been talking about where
8:55
voters are concerned about his age and acuity and they don't do a whole lot to answer
9:02
those questions I want to really focus on uh the heart of the question Amy asked us
9:09
though does the Democratic party have a plan if for whatever reason Biden became
9:15
unable to run does a plan B exist somewhere in some secret Lock
9:21
vault so there is no plan B it is Joe Biden will be the Democratic nominee
9:29
unless one of two things happens either there is a major health Calamity that he
9:36
suffers between now and November or Joe Biden himself decides
9:44
that he's not going to run and for the first thing you know we all hope that
9:50
the president remains in good health he Health yeah we're not wishcasting it there's no reason to believe that his
9:57
health is deteriorating you know he seems to be he rides his bike he rides to pelaton uh he is a very
10:04
healthy 81y old man there's also no reason to believe that he's going to wake up one day and decide this is not
10:11
for him like the man has wanted to be president of the United States for most
10:17
of his adult life he first started seriously considering running for president in 1984 he ran for president
10:24
three times he has raised already more than $200 million in this campaign for
10:30
reelection there's no reason to think that he is going to change his mind okay
10:37
let's slow this down though the only two things that could derail what seems like the inevitable path of Joe Biden becoming the Democratic nominee would be
10:45
a major health scare that will cause him to be unable to run I yeah that's right
10:50
okay this would be like a really serious calamitous health episode I mean Bernie
10:57
Sanders had a heart attack in the 2020 election ction and took a couple weeks off the trail if I remember correctly of
11:03
course there was the situation with Senator John featherman uh as he was running but you're saying it would have
11:09
to be something that would completely shift his ability to go out on the campaign Trail a president it would have
11:17
to be worse than those episodes okay I would think the other option is for him to decide independently that he would
11:23
not want to run anymore let's say you know Joe Biden were to say in 2 months
11:30
you know I want to step down what would even be the process like what would even
11:35
have to happen would it automatically go to the vice president like I actually don't know what would happen so I had to
11:42
make some calls on this nice nice thank you for doing that when you all told me that I had to answer this question I
11:48
didn't know either so there's two different scenarios and it depends on
11:53
when either a decision would be made or an episode happened if it was before for
11:59
the Democratic Convention in August the delegates to the convention would choose both the
12:06
president and the vice president if there was a vacancy it would be a free-for-all at the convention and based
12:13
on what we know generally of the makeup of who those delegates typically are it
12:19
would be hard to imagine a scenario where it didn't go to KLA Harris just because the the those are party people
12:26
those are people party people the biggest caucus is women the second
12:31
biggest caucus is African-Americans and those are two
12:36
groups that are generally pretty loyal to the vice president and also
12:43
like in a scenario where Biden is not the nominee anymore and there is chaos
12:50
at the convention you have to wonder like what Democrats are going to step up and
12:55
challenge the Vice President in that scenario further adding to the chaos further adding to the chaos she could be
13:02
in in some of these scenarios she could be the president at that point right and then you'd be challenging a sitting president it's not the vice president
13:09
like that's a very steep political lift for anybody in that type of chaotic
13:15
environment the second scenario is something happens with Biden after the convention there's no precedent for this
13:23
but the Democratic National committee chair who's Jamie Harrison would confer with the Democratic Leadership Congress
13:30
and the leadership of the Democratic governor Association wow and that group
13:35
would then basically be authorized to fill vacancies on the National Ticket
13:42
with some conferring with the broader DNC membership which is about uh 440
13:49
some people wow and again it's this is a scenario where it would be like
13:54
virtually impossible for them to pick anybody but the vice president to fill that spot based on what we know of of
14:02
those groups okay one I so appreciate you doing this kind of reporting because I have not thought about these scenarios
14:08
but there's a couple things that jump out to me in both of those situations either before the convention or after
14:13
this becomes a elite process the leadership of the democratic party whether at the DNC or at the
14:20
Congressional level or the gorial level would essentially get the power to choose who replaces Biden correct that's
14:28
right that's the way it would work and importantly because of that because of
14:34
the who the people are who would then be making the election and their investment in kind of the top levels of the democratic party it becomes very
14:41
difficult to see this becoming a situation that would lead to someone outside of the vice
14:47
president it just is a very difficult scenario to figure out
14:53
how it would be anybody else uh assuming that she wants it which there's no reason to believe that she wouldn't want
14:59
it you know you talk to Democrats and people say what about Gretchen Whitmer or Gavin Nome or you know any of the
15:07
people who ran for president in 2020 uh and it's just it's hard to
15:14
Fathom a scenario where anybody in that crew of Democrats could muster the sort
15:23
of organization and fundraising essentially on a moment's notice to to
15:29
compete in a serious way with the vice president right I mean it's interesting
15:35
because on oneand this is really uh expected right like that is the reason
15:41
the job of Vice President exist you know but at the same time it's super interesting to me that like because of
15:49
the unprecedented nature of this scenario and because it would only come up in a moment of chaos right like
15:57
inherently if Joe Biden's is not going to be the person in the ballot in November or if something were to come up
16:02
that were to trigger some of these scenarios it would inherently be a chaotic moment for the party that like
16:08
it it does seem as if the only answer to what happens after that is more chaos
16:15
you know like it doesn't seem like even if they were to hand it over to the vice president I can't imagine that be a
16:22
thing that happens really swimmingly right like to answer Amy's question of like is there something that very neatly
16:28
takes Joe Biden off of the path of being the Democratic Nomine the answer to me from what you're telling me seems to be
16:34
no the only reason that can happen is mess right if yeah if I mean an alien
16:43
abduction right anything that took Joe Biden off the stage would be immensely
16:50
chaotic and for the political system and the American government in general and
16:56
it's frankly a situation that we've never seen before for um you know you have to go back to 1968 when Lyndon
17:04
Johnson decided after the New Hampshire primary to get out but that was much earlier it was later in the calendar
17:11
than we are now but it was much earlier in the process of nominating a president than than what where Democrats are at
17:18
this point and you know everybody remembers at 1968 ended with riots at the Democratic
17:26
party convention also in Chicago where will be this year and a landslide victory for Richard
17:33
Nixon uh in part because of chaos that
17:40
that was sort of engulfed the Democratic party in that cycle yeah
17:48
yeah thank you re for your time thanks instead
17:56
bye are we still in here are we when is Maggie next up someone to fi our
18:03
questions about Trump who himself is 77 and is appearing to coast in the Republican primary after winning
18:10
contests in Iowa New Hampshire and Nevada he's also favored in this weekend
18:16
South Carolina Republican primary as he's polling well ahead of Nikki Haley the state's former Governor hey Maggie
18:23
how are you hi instead naturally I called Maggie Haberman
18:29
how's it going this has been a crazy morning because of these hearings yeah I'm sure I'm sure hang on let me um let
18:37
me just uh all right we're good we just talked to re Epstein and our colleague about
18:42
Biden's age and if there was anything that could happen that can kind of change the course of his kind of path to
18:47
the nomination in November and he said there was two things one is a big enough Health event and uh two would be
18:53
something that will cause him to wake up morning and decide that he doesn't want to run anymore but the both are very very unlikely scenarios now we know that
19:00
Donald Trump is also of an advanced age uh I guess I wanted to pose the same question to you like is there anything
19:08
that comes up in the kind of plan B category that could mean that Donald Trump wasn't the Republican nominee or
19:15
that the campaign wouldn't kind of continue its inevitable March to the conventions in November it's a really
19:21
good question so instead thinking about what Reed said about you know does Biden wake up one day and decide not to go
19:27
forward the chances of that happening for Donald Trump are close to zero um if
19:32
not you know greater than zero less whatever whatever negative integer you want to use um The Campaign is so
19:40
intertwined with his fight for you know staying out of jail uh given that he has been uh indicted four times and is now
19:48
facing a certain trial starting at the at the end of March in Manhattan so that comes off the table in terms of whether
19:54
there would be a health event that's not an impossible uh thought you know he is somebody who when he was President we
20:00
know from the White House doctors uh he had a form of heart disease U it's unlikely that that has um changed
20:08
dramatically in in a positive direction we don't know what his health is like now but I do know that at the end of
20:14
2022 when they were looking ahead to a a campaign that he was about to run there
20:20
was Private discussion about not holding too many events in part because he's old and you they they they didn't want to
20:27
cause him damage um by running him into the ground and I do think that that's part of why we have seen less of him I
20:32
think there's other reasons too like it saves the money not putting on events and so forth but but his age is a is a
20:38
factor that having been said it would have to be a a catastrophic event to keep him from running if it was
20:44
something mild um or something light I think he would try to push forward and
20:49
I'm not sure we would even know it was happening well let's try to separate these two things the first thing you
20:56
said is that like because of the kind of legal question sring around him and the fact that his political campaign is
21:02
frankly his uh uh uh his response for those things uh that that kind of
21:07
decreases the likelihood that he would ever kind of voluntarily step out the race we're talking to you on the day when those things are jumping off as you
21:13
said there was just a trial set for his uh uh criminal case in New York I guess I wanted to just underscore that part of
21:21
the reason you're saying that there is a not there's very little likelihood next to zero that Trump would voluntarily
21:27
step out of the race is because he needs the campaign as an answer to his legal troubles correct and and and as a answer
21:35
to his legal troubles both in terms of a shield during the cases remember he has
21:40
claimed presidential immunity although that's been struck down by an appeals court and is likely to go to the Supreme Court now uh in the January 6 federal
21:48
trial but in in Manhattan where he's been he's facing trial at the end of
21:53
March and this is related to uh hush money payments to a porn star in 2016
21:58
uh and in Georgia where it's related to his efforts to subvert the transfer of
22:04
power that he's been charged um you know he he is
22:09
claiming pieces related either to his duties in office in Georgia or in Manhattan it's you know this is this is
22:16
being done to distract from my successful Republican Presidential uh primary campaign and I I
22:23
shouldn't have to face this trial because we're in the middle of campaign season and so forth and so on so the president presential campaign has become
22:29
a setpiece got it yeah and and so that makes a lot of sense you know that the second part you're talking about
22:35
regarding his age I do think it's a kind of underrated uh uh point the point about heart disease that you made from
22:41
we learned when he was in office and that you know just as we have been a lot of talk about Biden's kind of visible
22:47
decline there has been more instances of Donald Trump you know I think about him uh confusing Nikki Haley for Nancy
22:53
Pelosi in reference to who was running January 6 security I mean when you think about the question of Trump's age how do
23:01
you think um that is going to be a factor on the campaign's Mind heading
23:06
into November Reed used the term that it need that that B that the things that would trouble the Biden campaign is a
23:12
health Calamity when you think about the Trump campaign is it that similar standard uh when we think about what
23:18
could cause them to kind of alter their Direction yeah it is I mean I you know I think that what you're talking about
23:25
specifically that Nikki Haley Nancy Pelosi moment that was really really pronounced yeah uh and so pronounced
23:31
that Trump felt the need to try to clear it up uh at a rally in South Carolina
23:36
this week when he's trying to um rewrite the history of it and insists he really did it on purpose which he clearly did
23:43
not if you watch the tape um then you can see that he knows this is a problem and that this is this is sinking in but
23:50
I do think it's the same issue if it it it would have to be something significant and and and I I
23:57
would put it actually even in a in a separate category which is a little different than Biden because we don't see an incumbent president or at least
24:04
this incumbent president as often as you might see a challenger because Challengers need to be out on the road
24:09
more presidents are protected by you know the armor of the office and doing
24:14
the job and don't have to be seen as much and always seem to be busy um even if we don't have visibility into that um
24:21
in Trump's case I think it would have to be something that literally could not be
24:26
um hidden right it would have to be an extended Hospital stay or it would have to be something that happens on stage or
24:32
in front of a crowd that's interesting I mean you're kind of pointing to like if they could keep it away from the public
24:38
they would if something were to happen under that kind of public St what correct and what I'm what I'm basing
24:44
that on instead is it's not like we have no predicate for that with Trump he was really really sick with Co and they were
24:52
um to to put it mildly less than candid about what was going on with his health so I have no reason to believe it would
24:58
be different this time yeah I guess I wanted to ask you also about you know some things that came up in our
25:03
conversation with one of our listeners does the Republican Party have a plan B
25:09
uh if it were not to be Trump or if something were to happen we asked this question also of Reed and Democrats it's
25:15
a good question but I mean I would I don't know what Reed's answer was but I would imagine it's similar which is there is no they there is no party
25:22
absent Trump trump is literally in the process of um outing his own handpicked
25:28
Republican party chair to try to get another one who he thinks will focus more on his um you know his false claims
25:35
of widespread election fraud right so um there is there is no they the process
25:41
works this way uh if something happens ahead of the convention um there would have to be a
25:48
change in the rules and it would have to be that the delegates process changes
25:54
because Trump is the is the person leading delegates right and Nikki Haley wouldn't
26:00
necessarily get those by default just because she's the person still actively campaigning I think you would see a lot
26:07
of other candidates who have suspended their candidacies suddenly start campaigning again and then it would get
26:13
decided at the convention just because Nikki Haley is currently the other candidate still actively running would
26:20
not inherently mean that if something were to happen to Trump Niki Haley becomes the nominee correct that is not
26:25
how this works if something were to happen after the convention then the 168
26:30
members of the Republican National Committee would have to meet again and decide on on what happens and
26:36
even then instead it gets murky because depending on when something would happen
26:42
you could end up in a situation where it's a wrin campaign in a lot of States because a lot of states will have
26:48
printed their ballots already they will already say Donald Trump correct and so it just gets it gets hairy okay so if
26:56
something were to happen before the convention then the delegates who formally nominate uh the the party's
27:03
nominee would have to there have to be some rule change that allows for you know them to back somebody else but that
27:09
doesn't inherently mean Nikki Haley it could mean other people try to woo them including the people who have previously
27:15
dropped out of the race if something were to happen after the convention then the Insiders of the Republican party or
27:22
the 168 members of the RNC would then have to kind of Select someone but to
27:27
your Point there's not real Clarity on any direction that would go it sounds like either before convention or after
27:33
if something were to happen it leads to enormous amounts of questions and somewhat inevitable chaos it is it is
27:40
definitely going to be chaos what level of chaos we don't know but yes it would be chaos right right so to sum it up in
27:47
answer to our uh listener Amy's question of there if there's anything that takes us off of this road of Biden Trump we
27:54
ask kind of and specifically in relation to age health and the legal concerns we asked Reed on the Democratic side and
28:00
his answer was uh extremely unlikely that anything would take us off this row
28:07
I'm going to pose the same question to you what is the likelihood that this ends in November with someone other than Donald Trump at this point as a
28:14
republican yes uh extremely unlikely and can I add an an asterisk to that it's
28:19
going to be a long asterisk there's a there is an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm where Larry David is at a
28:26
table and somebody spills on the table and his mother-in-law sits still and doesn't move and says somebody get a
28:31
sponge and Larry David says why don't you get a sponge and this sort of somebody get a sponge approach to Donald
28:38
Trump I mean we hear this a lot about it won't really be Donald Trump from from including Republicans who don't want to
28:45
deal with him but also from Democrats who don't want to deal with him anymore and uh somebody get a sponge has
28:51
somebody else take care of this uh has not been a solution and so that extends to all manners of things that could
28:59
happen to make him not the nominee it is extremely extremely unlikely that he
29:04
will not be the nominee it's not impossible anything can happen as we've seen yeah no I appreciate it I think
29:10
about like just talking to you and re back toback makes me think of just the interconnected nature of this like oh
29:17
yeah like I'm not sure if it wasn't Donald Trump that we would have Joe Biden and I'm not sure if it was Joe
29:23
Biden that we would have Donald Trump on this side but they both seem to at least ially need each other in this I I
29:30
completely agree with you um and I think we've talked about this but this race is
29:35
going to feel a lot less like 2020 at least as it's shaping up than 2016 um
29:41
when it was two nominees with who had had Nei neither of whom had been president with you know
29:47
High negatives now it's a former president and an incumbent president both with high negatives uh in an era
29:54
where every president uh has has bad approval ratings at this point because
29:59
that's just sort of how voters are toward elected officials um right voters have not given anybody High marks but
30:05
they're giving these two people especially low marks the national numbers are a unique situation that is
30:12
true thank you Maggie we really appreciate your time as always thank you thanks for having
30:18
me one more question after the [Music]
30:26
break [Music]
30:45
hey said hey Anna what's up not much you know another beautiful day in the office
30:51
another beautiful day in the office so I've been producing this episode the
30:57
question and answer listeners reaching out and um I actually ended up talking
31:02
to a listener who had a question this guy named Ellie hello hello this is Anna from the
31:08
New York Times hi this is Ellie hi Ellie how you doing I'm doing well and his question
31:15
was kind of in line with the broad theme that we've been talking about you know
31:21
like what could possibly happen that would rock us off the course that we're barreling towards yeah um so far we've
31:28
talked about what's happening like within the parties like what's happening with these candidates party infighting
31:34
and bylaws and all that sort of thing his question was more about outside forces that could make a difference in
31:39
this race I wrote a question asking basically how voters and different
31:47
people in kind of more critical positions are think about third party candidates there's um I mean primarily
31:53
around RFK um I'm a big supporter of RFK oh you are yeah I I'm a big supporter of
32:00
RFK have been since like beginning of this summer basically Ellie's question
32:05
was what about all the people who aren't Trump or Biden who are or might get in this race because he doesn't see what he
32:12
believes represented in either the Democratic or the Republican party I in general have a philosophy of like
32:19
positive politics and not negative politics I I try to resist the urge of
32:26
Dooms politicking like you have to vote for this person know the world's going to end because that just incentivizes
32:33
negative politics and I want to try to find candidates who I actually support for what they're saying even if I don't
32:39
support everything they're saying so like yeah if RFK wasn't in the race I probably would have been supportive of
32:44
maybe Cornell West maybe I would have looked for someone in the green party or libertarian party it's very much a
32:51
question in line with what we've been talking about this whole episode right people want to know is there anyone else
32:56
coming could anybody spoil the match between Trump and Biden like how would all of that even play out and so when I
33:03
was thinking about all that I realized that there's actually quite a few candidates or
33:10
people in this bucket of like potential third party potential Independence and it's been a while since we've talked
33:16
about them on the show so what I was hoping to do to kind of help this listener with his question is to do a
33:24
lightning round update basically where each of these candidates are and what challenges they face yeah that sounds
33:31
great am I the I'm the EXP I'm the lightning round answer yeah I didn't mean for this to feel like a pop quiz
33:36
but now I'm realizing it kind of feels like a pop quiz it definitely feels like a pop
33:41
quiz I'm so sorry did you like pop quizzes uh that's both know I did not
33:47
like pop quizzes now you and me both know I was a mid student the the you
33:52
know the representation Joe Biden gives is for the real sea students of America and so I didn't like quizzes of any form
33:59
told before or pop and I got a little crafty with all
34:06
of the candidates and so I I made something oh my oh this is a wheel yeah
34:14
A Wheel of Fortune Wheel yes yes with with all of the people that I could kind
34:19
of come up with um and so I figured we could spin it and you could give an update got
34:25
it this is so cute I like this okay
34:36
good oh that's so God I'm sorry this is so funny that's little like uh compet
34:42
confetti yeah okay Cornell West yeah what's up with him well Cornell West is
34:48
a pretty famous uh black studies Professor who was taught at like the Harvard's and the yalees we need you to
34:56
be part and parcel of wrestling with this corporate duopoly this two-party system that impedes it gets in the way
35:04
of the unleashing of the kind of policies of abolishing poverty and homelessness of dealing with working he
35:10
announced a green party presidential run last year but then after receiving some
35:15
criticism he got off of the green party ticket and is now uh trying to start his
35:22
own party which is called a justice for all party the problem is is and I think this is going to be an issue that comes
35:28
up with several of these people is when you're not in one of the major parties it's a lot harder to get ballot access
35:35
when you say ballot access are you talking you're talking General right yeah I'm talking about in November will
35:40
their name appear as an option for people to vote for so obviously that's step number one to actually have a
35:46
tangible impact on the race so Cornell West is in the position where uh I'm pretty sure he's only kind of at this
35:53
point focused on Florida I think there's an intent to focus on North Carolina but for the purposes of like will this
35:59
be a person who affects the November race I would say at this point that's
36:04
looking unlikely because of the real ballot challenges but as always with third party candidates they can push
36:10
issues to the top they can push sentiments to the Forefront that go
36:16
beyond their importance of actual votes so I do think you know Cornell West is someone who can highlight uh Biden's
36:22
potential struggles with black voters he's someone who can highlight uh particularly you know the war in Gaza and the progressive kind of leftist
36:29
group who is really upset with Biden and I think that that is a candidacy that threatens to stoke some of those concerns but is Corner W going to be on
36:36
the ballot in all 50 states it's not looking
36:44
likely Jill Stein Jill Stein um well this is helpful because Jill Stein has
36:50
taken the place that coronell West left on the green party Democrats have betrayed their promises for working
36:57
people Youth and the climate again and again while Republicans don't even make
37:04
such promises in the first place and both parties are a danger to our
37:09
democracy expanding like some of the other candidates we're going to talk about uh ballot access is not Stein's
37:15
biggest problem because she is the Green Party candidate and so uh she has ballot access in several States because the
37:22
party already has access Jill Stein threatens to play the same role she played in 2016 um when she was on the ballot at that
37:28
time now remember in that close election there was a lot of talk about whether third party votes really pulled away
37:35
from Hillary Clinton and helped spur the victory of Donald Trump um and while there's some kind of evidence or data to
37:41
that uh you know like I I I think that all of the one determining factors are
37:46
are overblown right it was a really close election in 2016 it was a really close election in 2020 and it threatens
37:53
to be a really close election in 2024 so in that reality all of these other impacts matter right
38:02
and certainly the possibility that some people could follow a trend from 2016 and maybe back a green Party candidate
38:08
over one of the two nominees um could be possible and I think for Jill Stein
38:14
specifically there will be a fear that she would pull from Joe Biden but I
38:20
would say on the scale of potency relative to other candidates I have not
38:25
heard the Biden campaign or someone involved in Democratic politics be particularly concerned about Joe Stein
38:31
this time
38:40
around well this one's easy marann Williamson uh Maran Williamson has dropped out of the presidential rates I
38:46
don't know if that's information that maybe uh has cut through or if people even knew Maran Williamson was running
38:53
but um the candidate that went kind of viral in 201 20 about being a a kind of
38:59
um you know
39:25
vibesyoutube forly dropped out a couple weeks ago and suspended her
39:35
campaign RFK Jr yeah so this is a kind of tricky one RFK Jr is by far the most
39:44
prominent um non-trump Biden candidate who has entered the 2024 race now
39:51
remember originally RFK Jr was running as a Democrat so like Marian Williamson like deam Phillips he was in the
39:57
Democratic primary trying to run against Joe Biden uh several months ago at the towards the end of last year he dropped
40:03
out of the democratic race and announced that he would run as an independent and
40:09
that creates some possibility and some challenges on the possibility side as I
40:15
was saying running in the Democratic primary has not proved really successful for folks right um because you have to
40:22
run in this kind of process that Joe Biden functionally controls through the DNC and there hasn't been real
40:27
motivation from base Democrats to replace Joe Biden even if they express some satisfaction what there has been is
40:34
real kind of polling data that says that people won an option outside of Biden and Trump and that is now where RFK Jr
40:41
is trying to position himself as people are remember his super pack paid a lot of money to have a Super
40:47
Bowl ad that was a carbon copy of an iconic Kennedy ad that JFK ran in the
40:53
60s and kind of updated it to say you should think about someone not a Democrat or repblic
41:01
[Music] who younger than these other candidates and is kind of pitching himself as the
41:06
freeth thinking person's candidate if you look at Poland RFK is in a different category than the Williamson or the dean
41:13
Phillips or the Jill Stein or Cornell West because of his name recognition you can see sometimes 10 15% of Voters even
41:20
upwards of that say they would be interested in that candidacy um but I would also say like that RFK would not
41:27
just represent a challenge for Joe Biden you know Donald Trump is usually the person who that type of libertarian or
41:35
cranky or or doesn't fit in a a conspiratorial voter flows to and that
41:40
not might be the case if RFK is also on the ballot and so that has created a lot of fear from kind of top levels of both
41:47
Democrats and Republicans who think it's not clear exactly who he would play spoiler for that's the first thing
41:54
second thing is like Cornell West he also has ballot access problems the benefit of running in a Democratic
42:00
primary of is of course if you were to beat Joe Biden become the nominee you're on the ballot because he is now saying
42:06
he's running as an independent he is currently engaged in a very expensive and difficult effort to get his name on
42:13
the ballot across the states that's the real thorn in the candidacy side is the
42:19
kind of logistical question of will they be able to get on the ballot but if he can overcome the ballot access problem
42:27
and become uh a legitimate candidate in this race this is the person that will
42:34
keep DNR up at night because if you can combine name money and message that's
42:41
the ingredients of a Ross perau or someone who can take a third- party candidacy and really go far all right
42:50
last one do we still spin the wheel or no I feel like for for to complete the
42:55
wheel we have [Laughter]
43:03
to all right no labels yeah this is a literal followup to the work we did last
43:09
year but um no labels is a nonpartisan independent political group in
43:14
Washington DC that has tried to Brand itself as the organization that's above
43:20
partisanship and polarization tries to encourage kind of bipartisanship through lawmakers and both parties rejecting
43:28
their Extremes in the last year No Labels has made a very public effort to
43:33
try to entice a candidate to run a third- party campaign for president that
43:39
they would support and help get on the ballot they called it a Unity ticket exactly they called it a Unity ticket
43:45
and the premise was that they were going to have one party at the top a different party as vice president and that that's
43:50
what Americans needed was a kind of joint ideological ticket now I think it's important to point out the
43:55
differences between between that and the kind of RFK right that's talking about independence in terms of like picking
44:01
and choosing different ideological buckets but isn't saying I'm strict right or left what no labels is talking
44:07
about is having one Republican one Democrat in a specific ticket that's centered around Unity right and so that
44:14
was their premise now when we talk to no labels it was clear that they had not fully thought through how a Unity ticket
44:22
was the solution to polarization and you know one of the things I really remember
44:27
about that reporting is that it made clear that the kind of top- down ideologically driven premise that no
44:33
labels Works in is not necessarily the language of people who hate both candidates so when you ask why do you
44:39
hate both candidates they might just say because they're old they might just say it because they don't like the system itself it's not clear that the type of
44:45
candidates No Labels was pitching as the solution the Joe Mansions the Mitt Romney the Larry Hogans are even people
44:52
that these folks know or would be people they come to so that's important to say now to update in the last year No Labels
45:00
has kind of had a tough go at it partially because their entire strategy
45:05
is premised on the idea of attracting a top tier candidate to join their ticket
45:11
now the person they have most tried to float is Senator Joe Mansion of West
45:16
Virginia who is um the you know more cous Democrat who has already announced
45:21
that he won't be running for reelection in November he just said last week he would not run uh as a third party
45:28
candidate and close the door on the prospect of working with no labels now this was their Top Choice this is
45:34
someone who is doing a listening tour talking about the need for bipartisanship uh uh and is really the
45:40
avatar for centrism in DC as a whole but
45:45
because of a low likelihood of success from a third party candidate and considering that um you know Mansion is
45:51
someone who does remain close to President Biden it's not particularly a surprise that he decided decided not to
45:56
eventually join the No Labels ticket but it does strike a big blow to the unity ticket that they wanted to project
46:03
because their top candidate that they wanted to lead that has now bowed out the other candidates they've talked
46:08
about have also made different decisions so Larry Hogan the former Republican governor of Maryland who No Labels are
46:14
trying to um entice he just announced that he was going to be running for Senate in Maryland so that's going to be
46:21
a tough race but more importantly he's not taking the presidential option and the drop off between those type of
46:28
candidates and who else they could get is so big that it's really created a
46:33
difficult position for No Labels to be in because if they don't have a candidate to actualize a lot of that
46:39
signing work a lot of that ballot access work it all kind of crumbles so if you're recognizing a theme here it's
46:46
that our system makes it very difficult for these third party options to succeed
46:52
if you want to be president the hardest thing to do is to try to do that without
46:57
the Democratic or Republican parties this unique situation because of the the
47:02
the distastefulness of candidates has created a different space so the rfks so the other parties can Garner more
47:10
interest and the closeness of our elections mean that that interest might really matter but for the broader
47:16
questions for the listener question of will these third- party options mean that we don't have Trump V Biden I think
47:24
that answer is clearly no what they can do is complicate the calculus of how
47:29
Trump versus Biden might play out or impact the type of issues they have to
47:35
address or they could become a vessel for people to Lodge their distaste right
47:41
it would not surprise me if we end this year with the highest number of third party votes we've had in a long time and that would certainly
47:49
matter but it is overwhelmingly likely because
47:56
of the way that our political process works that the next president is either the Democratic or republican nominee
