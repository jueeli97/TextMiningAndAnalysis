Why Joe Biden Isn’t Getting Credit for the Economy



0:02
H hello hello as he runs for re-election it feels like President Biden is talking
0:08
about one specific issue maybe more than anything else today us has the highest economic
0:16
growth rate leading the world economies since the pandemic the highest in the
0:21
world the economy our economy came roaring back unemployment dip below 4%
0:28
by the end of my first year in office under his administration there's been record low unemployment bringing down
0:35
inflation remains one of my top priorities today inflation is less than half less than half of what it was a
0:41
year ago and slowing inflation folks it's no accident he even
0:47
has a catchy nickname for his pitch that's biomics in action biomics is about building an economy from the
0:54
middle out and the bottom up not the top down to hear him tell it his leadership
0:59
brought Americans financial prosperity in the post-pandemic world the problem with that story though
1:07
is that so few Americans seem to buy it a recent survey of battleground States
1:12
from The New York Times and Sienna College found that 51% of Voters think
1:18
the state of the economy is poor and voters especially younger folks
1:24
and people without college degrees trust Biden less than Trump to fix it in fact
1:31
the problem is so bad that while Biden still touts the same economic message
1:36
his campaign seems to have ditched its signature catchphrase so what gives and what's the
1:43
gap between the good economy as described by Joe Biden and the not so great economy as felt by so many
1:52
Americans today a campaign to raise the minimum wage in Ohio and why the poorest Americans
1:59
aren't buying biomics from The New York Times I'm aad
2:05
hearon this is the
2:13
runup when I heard to the political group was organizing low-income service workers in Ohio around the idea of
2:20
raising the minimum wage in November I thought it could be a perfect way to get a view of President Biden's economy from
2:27
the bottom up so this past Saturday on a sunny 80° day in
2:32
Dayton y my colleagues Alisa Sophia and I went
2:38
to the downtown offices of a group called one Fair
2:43
wage hi y this is Alisa and Sophia from the
2:53
time we are greeted by a team of canvases Gathering signatures in order
2:58
to get a $15 minimum wage on the ballot in November want to take my
3:04
picture right now in Ohio the state's minimum wage is $10.45 for hourly
3:10
earners and for tip workers it's 525 an hour the measure needs just over 400,000
3:18
signatures to get on the ballot but the group's goal is to have 700,000
3:23
signatures by July and to get all those folks they've hired canvassers who have
3:29
held low wage service jobs themselves I would love to hear some some stories about y'all too like when did you first
3:35
start canvasing when did you first get involved in one Fair wage I I just got involved but I used to
3:42
be a um a low uh restaurant tip worker
3:48
one of the canvases marshelle is actually from Oklahoma City but has
3:53
recently come to Dayton to help with the organizing effort in Ohio I made did you work uh The Waffle House $213 an hour
4:02
plus tips and I was getting great tips but you know what the catch was the
4:07
people that wasn't getting tips I had to share my tips with them M so yeah so it
4:14
it wasn't it wasn't great that was in the state of Oklahoma yeah it's
4:20
$2.13 so just imagine $213 and I'm getting these tips but I got a sh with
4:26
three or four different people so I was really making nothing mhm when was that
4:32
that was 2 years ago mhm so when you heard about this what did you think I
4:37
thought this was great this is perfect we need to raise minimum wage especially
4:43
like everywhere in my state I come from a very red State and so I would love
4:48
when we get there to that state to my state so we can work on that because if
4:54
just imagine if I didn't get any tips can you live off of $213
5:00
I couldn't so this would be very helpful
5:05
to me if I at that time if I was getting $15 an hour I would live comfortable
5:11
plus tips so yeah you're like that's a tangible difference in quality of life
5:18
mm can you give me like an example about a time in which I mean this might seem
5:23
obvious but when it became really clear to you that that 213 plus tips wasn't
5:28
enough yeah when stuff started getting cut off I had five kids so can you imagine
5:34
having five kids on $2.13 an hour and you got your electric gas and water that
5:41
has to be paid and your cell phone bill can you imagine how I was struggling so
5:47
I had to get uh food stamps so it was like okay I'm just going to try to do the best I can do I'mma braid some hair
5:55
I'mma do people's hair and stuff on the side just to get a little extras to get
6:00
my kids you know the clothes they need I go to thrift stores uh garage sales like
6:06
that just to be able to uh provide for my kids the food pantry because I I
6:11
didn't get that many food stamps also but the food pantries came in handy too so that's how I was able to survive now
6:19
it's been days I didn't have no electricity I would go like 4 or five days without any electricity but we
6:27
survived with candles yeah what's it been like getting involved in this this been great this
6:35
been great because these people they really care about people I love campusing I love meeting people I can go
6:42
out and talk to people like I've been knowing them forever and I I want these signatures so I'm going talk to you get
6:48
these signatures because we have a goal to reach and I want to reach that goal it'll it'll help a lot of people the
6:55
other canvas we were heading out with that day Tia was a local
7:00
you're from you're from Ohio I'm from Dayton actually you're from Dayton okay I am um and where did you work uh
7:07
previously previously I did McDonald's um I was I actually was making 16 and it still wasn't enough so
7:14
I think it should go up to maybe like 20 because you know making 16 when you got
7:20
$900 rent your car payment is $800 even when you make 24 you know I know people
7:26
that make 24 and that sounds like a lot so yeah I was making more than an minian
7:31
and still just wasn't enough not to to make men ends meet and to you know I have a 13-year-old son at home my girls
7:38
are grown but you know he wants to go and do things and you know he wants all these iPhones and and things like that
7:46
and even with $16 I still couldn't do it I couldn't do it we head out to canvas
7:51
with marshelle and tia at the shopping center about 10 minutes south of
7:57
downtown Tia and I stood outside a thrift store and Alisa went off with
8:02
marshelle who was canvasing outside a nearby beauty supply
8:08
store hello could I get you to sign my petition to raise minimum wage to $15 an
8:13
hour sure okay thank you ma'am are you a reg voter in the state okay here you go for the most part count are you it was a
8:20
straightforward pitch hello sir would you like to sign my petitioner W minimum
8:25
wage to $15 an hour I don't care about people making money I just love to have
8:31
fun people got to make some money around here yeah it let me get over here quick all
8:37
right after folk signed we wanted to know why this issue mattered to them how
8:43
they were feeling about the economy more generally and who they blame for its current state like you so you signed the
8:49
petition I guess how do you feel about the economy I feel like the economy right now is crap Alisa Marshall met a
8:56
man named Dave who said he works in the health insurance industry minimum wage
9:01
is too low um inflation is definitely too high uh even if you make six figures
9:08
you need to make nine figures to survive in this economy so do you feel like it's gotten worse over the years it's gotten
9:14
worse definitely over these last three years what do you account that to why do you think that is I'm going to account that to Joe Biden and his administration
9:21
and what they're doing um I really believe
9:27
that them increasing the prices on every single thing and you know I know they're
9:33
trying to get their money back from giving out all them stimulus checks but but come on now we can't even live we
9:39
got to rob Peter to pay Paul and then that's just not working how did you feel about the stimulus checks do you feel
9:44
like those were necessary those were definitely necessary but at the same time I feel like there should have been
9:50
things in place for people not to over abuse them um you know and we're just
9:56
paying for everybody who did all that PPP fraud that's what we're paying for did you vote for Biden in I vote for
10:02
Biden is it making you reconsider voting no I'm going to vote for him again vote for him again um you know even though
10:08
inflation is crazy high right now I still believe that he's done a lot um
10:13
outside of that um and I feel like if we give him another chance he'll do even more okay so then you have issues with
10:19
him when it comes to economy I guess then what is your motivation for voting for him again in the fall well he did
10:25
what he's supposed to do with the student loan debt um finally um he's done things um as far as um him
10:33
and KLA when it comes to diversity and inclusion among communities um and so
10:38
they've done a lot of great things uh I would say and that's that would leave my vote towards them now I do miss Trump
10:44
trump did give us the money Trump did give us the money I do believe that Trump was more so a
10:50
president for for helping the lower class citizens um
10:57
but yeah that's you but did you ever vote for Trump I did vote for Trump you
11:02
okay so tell me walk me through so did you vote for Trump in 2016 yes uh but you voted for Biden in 2020 yes okay
11:10
tell me why did you vote for Trump in 2016 uh so I voted for Trump because Trump was funny I'm going to be
11:15
completely honest he was a funny guy I watched him on Celebrity Apprentice for many years and followed his his business
11:23
mindset um so that's why I voted for him and not to know that all the stuff that he was going to do while he was elected
11:28
you know was going to come out all of that stuff but him as a person that I viewed then is why I voted for him so
11:34
then you vote for Biden is that because uh tell me tell me then how you that point I was grown and more mature and so
11:40
and then uh I seen the state of the world as the United States was going in and that direction um president Trump
11:47
was put in this in was bad it was bad um and when did you decide that one like 20 2017 2018 probably
11:55
2019 um 2020 actually really when when the whole really outbreak of Corona
12:00
virus really took its toll and I seen how he was treating people from China
12:06
and his remarks and that and I'm like okay now this is not a joke this is really who he is um and started to look
12:15
into everything else and then that that persuaded my vote against him for his second term okay okay and now and now
12:22
you're decidedly you're going to vote for Biden in yes yes I'm going to give
12:28
Biden a second chance um I believe that he's doing what he said he was going to
12:33
do um during his campaign everything he said he was going to do he pretty much done okay um and so he lived up to his
12:40
word even though he made the cost of living high they waited till I started making six figures to to to make the
12:46
cost of living crazy but uh I believe that he's going to redeem he's going to redeem the United States thank you so
12:52
much I'm Alisa while Alisa stayed with marelle good afternoon sir would you like to time the petition to raise
12:58
minimum wage to $1 I did yesterday Sophia and I started talking to a man named Rod who worked at the sandwich
13:05
place nearby and was wearing his work uniform when he signed the petition how you doing sir my name is ath this is
13:11
Sophia we're from The New York Times we're actually in Ohio today talking to people about how they feel about the
13:17
economy how they feel about things are going in the country right now uh how they feel about this crazy election we're about to have do you mind if you
13:22
have five minutes to chat with this sure thank you I appreciate it you may like what I have to say but I will I will
13:29
promise you that as long as you're saying something that's honest I would love to hear um can you tell me your name
13:35
Rod all and are you from uh the county where are you from uh Miamisburg okay
13:40
cool um you know you said you signed the minimum wage petition yesterday what made you want to sign I mean most of my
13:46
life I've worked in food as I still do and we've always gotten paid less than
13:52
what I thought we should be getting paid mind if I ask how much you get paid now I make 18 now mhm which isn't too bad
14:00
especially I don't think for making a sub MH I know people that work at factories they get paid that and they do
14:06
a lot harder work than I do mhm MH but you're saying you've always worked in food and so usually that number has been
14:12
less than that oh yes definitely can you tell me about some of the other rates that you were working at places and how
14:18
much you were making uh I mean all the way back to my first job when I first started working at Taco Bell I made uh
14:25
265 an hour but I mean that's when I was 16 yeah um I mean ever I don't know for the
14:33
past you know few years it's been you know $10 or more um but you know even then
14:42
like I just feel like people should be able to work like you or me or anybody should be able to work by themselves and
14:48
take care of themselves you can't do that especially not at 10 12 $13 an hour
14:55
which is what most places are at about now mhm uh McDonald's probably has the best pay
15:01
out of fast food places I guess I'm wondering with that $18 an hour and this
15:07
economy is it enough for you how are you feeling right now my wife works and I door Dash when I get off
15:13
work so I mean technically I guess I have two jobs what's the biggest
15:19
stressor for you income wise when you think about your budget well um I mean together my wife
15:27
and I both like we enough to pay all the bills and everything and go to the
15:32
grocery store but there's nothing left for us to do what we want to do with the
15:37
money not what we have to do with the money um so that's why I door Dash has
15:43
that changed in recent years I mean I've heard people talk about the rising prices I mean what has been the change
15:48
like for you uh over the last couple years when you think about money in the
15:54
economy the biggest thing is everything has increased in price everything I
16:00
don't care what it is from gas to rent to food whatever the case is and because
16:07
of that you know it's it just makes everything else harder like if I was
16:13
making $18 you know even 5 years ago or let before Co hit I would have been
16:20
making decent money then you know I probably could have worked myself and took care of things myself who do you
16:27
blame for the rise in prices is there someone you blame specifically well I mean it all comes
16:34
down to the Man In Charge I think I mean he's the one that can say yay or no to anything now mind you there's still
16:40
checks and balances where he can't just absolutely say no or yes
16:46
but you know a lot of the people there that are there now are just they're not
16:53
on the right track I don't think what do you mean can you be more specific I mean they're they're not thinking about everyone are you talking
17:00
about President Biden you talking about Democrats you talking about Trump are you who you talking about Biden okay and
17:07
Democrats I mean I was a Democrat for years and up until Trump ran I switched
17:15
in 2016 yes mhm and it was just because you know as a lowincome person I mean
17:22
you're just automatically drawn to being a Democrat cuz they always want to give you things well as I've got older I've come
17:30
to realize that they lie a lot they tell you all this stuff's coming and it never
17:35
comes or that this is changing it never changes now not to say that the same
17:41
hasn't happened with a republican cuz it has but I figured like you know
17:47
I've been on one side long enough and they weren't working for me so I switched what' you do in 2020 did you
17:53
vote for Trump again um I don't remember I would say
17:59
yes I mean weird thing about this one we got the same two again when you look ahead do you know who's going to get
18:06
your vote November oh definitely Trump without a doubt when they you know
18:11
there's a lot of you know Trump cut taxes for the rich Trump added to the deficit there's a lot of arguments that
18:17
you can say that he you know he didn't prioritize low wage workers either so why does he definitely have your
18:24
[Music] vote um well I just think the country
18:30
in general was in a better place when he was the president then Biden has
18:37
been the whole time pretty much I mean you know he was again he was one of
18:43
those people that came out and said you know we're going to do this we're going to do that we're going to give you this we're going to give you that nothing mhm
18:51
he keeps making up excuses about the border for instance about how I can't
18:58
just close the Border I can't do that he he can he legit can sign a piece of paper and stop the whole thing but he
19:05
won't because it's an election year if you could rank your most important issues economy you mentioned
19:12
immigration there is there anything at the top of your list when you think about the things that most matter to you
19:18
and then why you're voting for Trump I don't know I mean even even
19:25
though Trump is you know super rich like I don't know why but I feel I can
19:32
relate to him more which is kind of weird for me to say still to this day about a republican to be
19:38
honest um but I don't know he just maybe he's
19:44
lying too but he definitely is saying all the right things and wanting
19:51
to maybe not correct but at least make better some of the things that have fallen off since Biden took office do
19:58
you trust Trump or Biden more on the economy Trump trump or Biden more on
20:04
immigration Trump is there any issue that you prefer Democrats to considering
20:09
used to be a Democrat well I mean I like the way
20:15
Democrats think um if they would just follow through with everything I mean a lot of
20:21
the ideas that they come up with are great ideas problem isn't words it's action yes got it I mean you can't tell
20:28
somebody you know like if you're a friend and I tell you I'm coming over M I didn't come today or I'm coming
20:34
tomorrow I didn't come tomorrow I'm coming you know you can't just keep telling somebody that over and over and over and over they're just going to be
20:40
like whatever don't come you know that's just where I'm at with that and all honesty I wish we didn't have parties in
20:47
general because when it's all said and done we're all one country we're all one
20:54
people and we should all you know have the same
20:59
or or at least close to the same set of values and morals and I don't feel like that's the case right now thanks R can
21:07
you just tell me last night as we were talking to Rod we were told that the store manager called the cops to try to
21:13
get the organizers and us away from their business so we followed the organizers
21:19
to another strip mall about a 15minute drive away on the west side of
21:25
Dayton that's where Sophia and I met a woman named Tina my name is aad this is Sophia we're with
21:30
the New York Times we've been talking with the canvases today and asking people why they decided to sign I know you got some bags we can walk with you
21:36
too we just wanted to know why you decided to sign and I heard some stuff about you like working with folks
21:42
returning and so I just would love to hear that store yes and so we can walk with you if that's easier okay okay
21:48
thank you no problem can you just tell me a little oh cool thank you uh can you
21:53
just tell us a little bit about yourself all right um I work for the
21:59
Montgomery County office thank you baby Montgomery County Office of re-entry we
22:05
welcome back returning citizens who are coming from incarceration uhhuh I'm
22:11
sorry darling we can we got all good want right yes darling that's fine a lot
22:17
of the returning citizens come back they went to prison because they were Street
22:24
men they had stacks of money all the time
22:29
so what sense does it make to come out of prison after you're used to having
22:35
money to survive and you're just making minimum wage so I think it's important
22:41
that that minimum wage is increased to help people live and to survive I'm a
22:47
single woman so my income is my only income and it's hard to try and juggle
22:56
between do I get food or gas what what
23:01
do I do or do I just try to wait for another two weeks to pay the utility
23:06
bill pay a part of the utility bill no one deserves to have to live like that
23:11
yeah we're talking about others I'm curious for you too like how long you been in Dayton are you are you from around here I'm from Dayton I sure am um
23:18
we're also asking people about the election how they feel about the country right now uh if I could pose that question to you how would you relate the
23:25
way people are kind of feeling that economic Strife to kind of the state of the country optimism and how things look
23:33
going forward as far as our government is concerned you got to meet the people
23:40
where they are so politicians who are out and who are advocating for a
23:46
position in government you got to go where the people are and you got to stay
23:52
there like you just don't go for photo ops and things like that you got to become a part of the community that you
24:00
are trying to win an election for you know the interesting thing is Ohio was
24:05
such an important place for the presidential race historically um and there's a kind of open question about
24:11
whether it's still a place that Democrats can do well and things when you think about if you're President
24:16
Biden do you think Ohio is a place where he he can still win I think Ohio is a place that he can still win there are a
24:24
lot of spiritually LED people here in the state of Ohio who believes that if
24:31
you have a heart for people that you'll do good in office so I just believe if
24:36
he begins to just come and just advocate for some things for the people here that
24:43
he would have a strong chance at winning the election again the long the last thing I ask is you know for us being
24:49
around so many dating black folks today I've had I haven't heard a lot of good things about how they're feeling about
24:55
Democrats or how they're feeling about even President Biden what do you think has shifted that has
25:01
you know made a community that historically has been so Democratic support of and when I'm around here over
25:07
today and talking to people I hear a lot of people upset do you hear the same thing do you think or um do you think
25:14
that's just the kind of outlier voice I do hear the same thing when Obama was in
25:20
office I believe that the African Americans had a lot of Hope a lot of
25:25
Hope but when when he did his bid and his term and now I just believe that
25:31
they just feel hopeless we have a mayor who was the mayor of Trotwood Ohio for
25:39
several terms and she ran those terms as a Democrat but then she switched
25:47
affiliation to Republican so that says a lot it it
25:53
speaks volume it really really does do you hear Trump even making inroad sometimes
26:00
and I'm always torn to how real we think that is do you think that what do you
26:05
think is drawing some connection between someone who I think eight years ago we would have said there's no way he's
26:11
winning some black folks and now I'm like I'm not so sure yeah yeah I do know
26:17
um African-Americans who support Trump yes they support him because they feel
26:23
as though he is a go-getter he's questionable yeah
26:28
but he says what he means and he's not afraid to stand up to
26:35
the opposition and so I believe that you know African-Americans they just want to
26:40
support someone who is gun ho and gun strong and going to do that so they kind
26:47
of Overlook the things that he's kind of going through in his life all those
26:52
cases can mean less if he's someone who says what he means and does what he means yes yes if I'm hearing you correctly though we I should expect you
26:59
to vote for Biden in November question mark I would vote is that what you're asking is that who you
27:05
think you're going to vote for yes yes thank you so much I appreciate your time
27:10
thank you this was really great thank you for helping have a great day almost everyone we met in Dayton
27:16
that day was eager to get the $15 minimum wage on the ballot in November
27:21
but their intentions at the top of the ticket or less clear and who ever going to forget my
27:27
student love I'll take you can go ahead and get it office I think I probably if you won't think of student loans we got
27:33
to go Trump no Biden been forgiving the loans he was been clearing loans where you at Donald Trump why he a clear yet
27:40
you a got to get in line to be honest with you yeah I hate to say it but it's
27:45
honestly you know what I'm saying we got a lot done with Trump in office including people who wouldn't be voting
27:51
at all this in franchise it's coming from a man that's born in 60 so I know
27:57
what it's like for brothers that have the right to vote I've always frowned on people say I'm not voting what's wrong
28:03
with you well I see now I wouldn't vote for neither one of the presidents vote
28:09
for the lesser of the two evils you know what I'm saying like but you still
28:14
voting for evil because what what they doing is wrong you know what I'm saying so like you know what I'm saying so I'm
28:20
not going to even get into that part of more after the break
28:30
[Music]
28:38
[Music] traditionally Ohio has been an important
28:43
Battleground in the Electoral College a toss up for republicans and
28:49
Democrats but in recent years the state has trended toward the right making it
28:54
an uphill battle for Democrats to win its 17 electoral votes that's bad news for Ohio democrats
29:02
like incumbent Democratic senator Shar Brown whose bid for reelection could tip the balance of power in the
29:09
Senate it also makes ballot efforts like the one to raise minimum wage to $15
29:15
even more important because they could be the main reason some Democrats are motivated to
29:21
show up to vote and so I wanted to sit down with Mariah Ross a Cleveland native
29:27
in the ballot the itive director for one Fair wage to better understand the
29:32
relationship between efforts like hers and races at the top of the
29:38
[Music] ticket um is there anything that jumped out from the people we talked to that
29:44
you that stuck out to you um It's Something That We're hearing every day and that's the fact that people can't
29:50
afford their bills I think what we saw today just proves the point that this issue is top of mind for black voters
29:56
Latin voters and Youth all around the state and around the country mhm what happens next so in
30:02
terms of being able to reach the signature threshold and then once that is reached how will this campaign
30:07
transition yeah so after we collect over 700,000 signatures which is our goal and
30:12
we turn them in to the Secretary of State then we're going to move into phase two of our Campaign which is going to be our peer-to-peer program so these
30:19
canvers who you've met today who are low wage workers or they've worked in the restaurant industry they're going to
30:25
lead our peer-to-peer program talking to their co-workers talking to people who they know in the industry other unlikely
30:32
voters because what we found is that when candidates run on this issue and
30:37
there's a peer-to-peer program and they're actually outspoken about the issue not just on a piece of paper but
30:43
they actually talk about it then these unlikely voters will go vote for this issue and for those candidates who
30:49
support the issue that's what we saw today when people saying oh I don't usually vote but you know I'll come vote for this um and so that's just true
30:55
across the board pass you about Ohio's less I'm curious like what makes you think Democrats still do have a shot and
31:02
there been a couple bad cycles for them here yeah I think Ohio's views and I
31:07
wouldn't even say necessarily Democrat and Republican because it's so confined a lot of people are independent it
31:13
really in the Day-Day life um people are more conservative people are more Progressive but most people identify as
31:18
independent when you are making the bare minimum and you're worried about how you're going to feed your kids tonight
31:24
you can't really care about an election that may not actually change your life or maybe will affect you three to four years later you're worried about today
31:31
today only right maybe tomorrow but mostly you're focused on today all right and you don't have the capacity to be
31:37
able to care about voting or get involved in an election that isn't going to affect your ability to pay your bills
31:44
and feed your family uh so at the end of the day I think that a lot of Ohioans especially people who are either living
31:51
in poverty or making wages that aren't sustainable or living paycheck to paycheck um they can't get involved in
31:57
Civic engagement because not just the education Factor because we do need more Civic engagement
32:02
education in the state but the factor of I don't have time for that you know
32:07
other issues are important climate change is important but nobody can care about that because who are who are
32:12
making low wages because that is going to affect them 20 to 30 years from now same thing with other issues that are
32:17
hard to understand we have Jerry mandering H Initiative for that happening right now in Ohio and people
32:23
do want Fair districts however a lot of people who are making low wages don't have capacity to learn what that is or
32:30
even go and vote for that or even register to vote because they can't take a day off work um people don't have time
32:37
people aren't just working one job working one job at minimum wage you might make 1,800 a month people are
32:43
working two to three jobs to get by and working side hustles are in a gig economy people are doing door Dash
32:49
people are doing Uber people are doing lift people are doing hair on the side
32:54
you know people are just trying to get by and so people have very hectic schedules and there's no capacity to
32:59
about that isn't going to change your actual situation I know that people are engaged when you ask them about minimum
33:04
wage are they engage when you ask them about voting in general like cuz when we you know it's been pretty bleak out
33:11
there when we talk to people about their level of interest in this election um no yeah people tell us oh that that isn't
33:16
going to change anything or oh no I don't do politics you know we get those traditional answers however we always
33:22
push back against that and say you should care about politics especially about your local politics you know about
33:28
your Statewide politics because those will affect your day-to-day lives and when you explain how it affects someone's day-to-day lives about hey you
33:34
can get the minimum wage raise in your state hey you can um get your streets repaired get that abandoned house tore
33:40
down or you know fix some tax issues in your City municipal tax issues things like that we explain why local elections
33:47
are so important and you can vote for your Sheriff you can vote for your judges a lot of people don't even know
33:53
that you can vote for judges so when we explain those things to people people are like I see what you're saying I do want to get involved I do want to do
33:59
that um so we register them to vote and then we're going to follow up with them and continue to talk to them about
34:05
pivotal issues that actually can affect their day-to-day lives because that's the big disconnect Democrats and
34:10
Republicans have failed a lot of working people in the fact that it's not about the GDP or the unemployment rates for
34:17
most people it's about how much is the eggs in the grocery store how much is the gas for my car like how much is my
34:23
rent and so working people haven't seen a change in those things they just getting worse every year on the ground
34:29
and so when they see somebody actually trying to change those things when we see people fighting for housing issues
34:35
people fighting for wages people fighting for things that actually will change their day-to-day lives then
34:40
people want to get involved because they can see tangible results and that's what it's about yeah and to your point that's
34:45
not necessarily the conversation you hear either from D or R when you think about the presidential race or even Joe
34:51
Biden lot it's a lot of the GDP it's a lot about employment uh and you've hear a lot of Democrats right now they say
34:57
econom is very good in fact like can you explain the the the gap between that
35:03
language and what you experience on the day if I'm a Democrats saying the economy is good right now does that message hit I think there's a bit of a
35:10
disconnect on the definition of economy yeah what is an economy mean if you ask an economist it'll be you know GDP
35:17
unemployment rates and a lot of other factors that the average American does not understand right or care about quite
35:24
frankly um but if you ask an average worker they would tell you an economy is
35:30
how much does it cost to get the items I need to live and does my livelihood
35:35
cover those costs do I make enough money to cover the cost to live that is what
35:41
the economy is to most people so you ask people you'll hear a lot of people say the econom is terrible and that doesn't
35:46
mean they're talking about GDP or unemployment rates they're talking about the gas is expensive in my community and
35:52
I make a wage that doesn't afford that gas so therefore to me the economy is
35:58
bad that is what the economy means to average American and I think it's just a definition issue like the traditional
36:03
word a good economy a bad economy or economics in general with with e economists versus what people actually
36:11
think the economy is what their experience is yeah so how you feel about the economy
36:17
now the bottom of us could definitely use more pay C it yes I actually make 15
36:23
an hour right now yeah more than anything what I took from our afternoon in Dayton
36:30
is that for the people we talk to the everyday lived experience of the economy
36:36
matters more than traditional economic indicators they have a working mother that makes you know what I'm saying that
36:43
they got to live from pay check to paycheck but still got to go down here to a pantry to get food to provide for
36:50
her kids you know what I'm saying we is everybody is out for something it's always this prices are going up I'm
36:58
sorry I'm penny pinching and and my kids are grown now but I'm still penny pinching um thank God that I
37:06
have you know a family that we all live together like my dad my my husband my
37:11
son so we split the bills but I couldn't even imagine doing it by myself I mean
37:16
literally anything you purchase is higher in price now than it was couple years
37:22
ago um you know it's not it's not sustainable without
37:28
you can't keep raising the cost of living without allowing people to meet that at least somewhat the cost of
37:35
housing and food remain high my just my rent is
37:40
$910 off of my wages and it's not enough basically we do need more money it's
37:46
been struggling lately but most people aren keeping track of the way the food and stuff's been going off and everything 15 ain't even ain't even
37:54
enough and if you got kids you really struggling yeah and wages aren't keeping up way in
38:01
order to to work minimum wage you have to live in like a lowincome housing or something like it's hard it's like you
38:07
cannot get
38:14
ahead so while the US economy might be the world's best as President Biden likes to describe it that doesn't mean
38:22
it's working in Dayton or for most Americans
38:28
