Your Guide to a Trump vs. Biden Debate


0:03
get ready to hear the truth about America on a show that's not immune to the facts back in February Donald Trump
0:10
called into this conservative radio program called The Dan banino show
0:15
president Donald J Trump president Trump welcome back to the show it's always good to have you my friend how are you
0:22
well thank you Dan very much and for lack of a better ter he threw down the gauntlet think he's going to run but I'd
0:29
like to call immediately debates I'd like to debate him now because we should debate challenging President Joe Biden
0:35
to debate him even though Trump had skipped the GOP Primary debates I wow
0:41
look at that we're breaking news Mr President Donald J Trump calls for debates against uh Joe Biden I that's
0:48
great break these problems then and get him to change his ways but I am officially
0:56
doing eventually Biden accept it and he even up the ante with a campaign pushing
1:02
the schedule of the matchup earlier than most people expected as in tonight at a CNN studio
1:09
in Atlanta and while we can't know exactly what will happen on stage we've seen the
1:15
show before bitter insults a constant Blame Game and more than anything a
1:21
political spectacle that's often judge on the Optics more than the substance but considering both
1:28
candidates are offering radically different Visions for the country it's hard to imagine an election
1:35
where the substance matters more so today there's no buzzer no mic
1:42
muting and instead just the policy I call four of my colleagues to
1:49
talk about what the candidates are actually promising for a second term on some of the issues Americans care the
1:55
most about from The New York Times i a Hern
2:00
this is the run [Music]
2:09
up four issues that usually rank high on the list of voter concerns are the
2:15
economy immigration abortion rights and foreign policy and that's where I wanted
2:21
to focus nomics is about building an economy from the middle out the bottom
2:26
up not the top down the minute crooked Joe Biden shuffles out the door I will
2:31
rapidly rebuild the greatest economy the history of the world look we had the greatest economy in
2:38
history starting with the [Music] economy I'm Jim tankersley I cover
2:45
economic policy at the White House for the times in Washington so I call my colleague Jim tankersley okay I wanted
2:52
to get a sense of how Trump and Biden differ on the economy in a second but I think first it would be helpful to get a
2:57
sense of the big picture where has the Biden Administration been on economic policy up until this point well I mean I
3:04
did first off I think that the Administration has a very coherent economic strategy they basically had to
3:10
do two things the first thing was they had a strategy to try to finish the job of recovering from the pandemic
3:15
recession with a big stimulus Bill uh which they passed in 2021 and then
3:21
they've tried to do a whole bunch of bills to kind of increase basically the
3:26
performance of the domestic economy and they are certainly frustrated when we talk about Economic Policy we don't lead
3:32
with those attempts or with the fact that economic growth has been faster under Biden uh in his first three years
3:38
as president than anyone since Jimmy Carter that does feel like an important Baseline it is it is but it's also true
3:45
that the thing that they get dinged most on is also a thing that hasn't happened for decades for a president which is that Biden has presided over a period of
3:51
very high inflation and really rapidly Rising costs for American families that
3:56
inflation rate peaked like a couple years ago it's been coming back down but it's still above historical norms and
4:03
when the president is like swimming Upstream on economic policy that's the big problem he is fighting against
4:09
people have not liked the inflation they've gotten along with his other policies and it's LED them to overlook
4:16
the other effects of those policies on the job market where unemployment is very low on GDP growth even on you know
4:24
people's wages which are growing but people are just annoyed at how fast prices are growing at the same time yeah
4:30
that is the problem and I think that's a helpful articulation of it can you give me a sense of kind of the policy
4:35
differences that we might understand between Biden and Trump on economic policy and we wanted to do that based on
4:41
three key areas inflation cost of living taxes and jobs what were the major moves
4:48
that Biden has done in this term to try to address it and has he said anything about a possibility of a second term and
4:53
what he would do differently yeah if you look at what Biden's done I mean first off just to really stimulate this
4:59
inflation is the job of the Federal Reserve far and away but presidents can influence particularly in times like
5:05
this on the margins inflation so Biden has mentioned a couple of things that he has really been focused on now and there
5:12
are smaller things in the broad scope of prices across the economy but there are little things that he's trying to do to
5:18
bring down prices he has focused really hard on passing and signing legislation to allow the government to negotiate
5:24
prescription drug prices to bring down drug prices he has tried to both just
5:29
rhetorically go after and then also use some levers of government to go after companies for what he calls corporate
5:35
greed excess profit margins and he's targeted what the White House loves to call junk fees which are like little
5:42
cost increases like on concert tickets a airline tickets and in the second term I
5:47
think there's a couple of big things that he has said he would like to do that could affect inflation one of them
5:52
is he wants to raise taxes on people making more than $400,000 a year but he wants to do so in a way that would
5:58
reduce the budget deficit and on balance that could have some small but marginal
6:04
effect on bringing down inflation and then the second thing he wants to do is just kind of do more with his antitrust
6:10
corporate agenda in a way that the White House argues will help green prices down neither of those are large but those are
6:17
sort of the cornerstones of his policies for bringing down price growth I would say and are most likely to affect
6:23
inflation mhm can we get to what Trump has said or particularly on the issue of inflation we know he has blamed Biden
6:29
for the current state of prices but what has he done while in office and do we have any clues of what Donald Trump
6:35
would do in regards to inflation if elected in the secondary yeah I mean I think it's really important to note that Trump came to office at a very different
6:42
economic moment than Biden right inflation had been low for basically this entire century and it's that's
6:49
important because it's one of the reasons why people are so mad about it now is that they just aren't used to it you know in the 70s and 80s people got
6:55
used to higher inflation they're not used to it now so Trump comes in takes over an economy with with low amount of
7:01
inflation and then he's able to do some economically stimulative policies a big
7:07
tax cut he calls on the Federal Reserve to get stimulative with their policies too which they do and and fed officials
7:13
have been adamant that they didn't respond to Trump they just did it because they thought they needed to but he gets both stimulative monetary policy
7:20
stimulative fiscal policy and that helps to grow the economy but he's not really that worried about inflation because
7:26
people are not expecting High inflation and and it stays pretty low until the pandemic so Trump's biggest argument I
7:33
think for like I can bring back low inflation is I did it before but it's a very different economic moment and I
7:39
think we should just like start with that knowledge that if you just came in and reran Trump's Playbook from four
7:45
years ago you'd have really different effects and that could very well happen he's talked about a thing that
7:51
Republicans talk about a lot which is like cutting unspecified government spending in theory if you cut a lot of
7:57
government spending and reduce the deficit by a lot you could bring down inflation in the same way that you could
8:02
bring down inflation with tax increases like Biden wants to do but I think the other big policy that Trump has talked
8:08
about that would affect prices if not the actual inflation rate is tariffs
8:13
yeah he wants to put new taxes on imports from all around the world and particularly on imports from China and
8:19
that's just going to raise the cost of those products for people so in Trump you have this sort of rhetoric of I'm
8:25
going to cut government spending I'm going to roll back all the terrible Biden things that's going to solve inflation and then I can do my own thing
8:32
but I don't that's not really adding up to what I think most economists would call a coherent policy to bring down
8:37
inflation and there's a lot of what Trump is talking about that economists say really risks exacerbating more inflation yeah let's get to the issue of
8:44
taxes what has Joe Biden done and what does he promise he would do in the second term specifically when it comes to taxes so sort of like very
8:52
counterintuitively what Biden has done thus far if you add all of his tax policies up is slightly cut taxes over
8:59
the entirety of his administration but he wants to raise a lot of taxes that that's mostly reflective of the fact
9:06
that he hasn't been able to get Congress to go along with the trillions of dollars in corporate and high earner tax
9:13
increases that bid wants to campaign for even back in 2020 absolutely yeah I mean
9:19
you know the big tax debate in this campaign is going to center around the expiration of some tax cuts that Trump
9:25
signed into law in 2017 and what Biden wants to do is keep and extend the tax
9:31
cuts for people making less than $400,000 and then allow to expire tax
9:37
cuts for people earning more than that and some business tax cuts that are also set to expire and then on top of that
9:43
raise more taxes on the rich and on corporations and that's sort of his tax reform plan okay whereas Trump just
9:50
wants to make permanent all the tax cuts that he signed in the first place and he wants to go farther he wants to give
9:55
more uh tax cuts to corporations he wants to give more tax cuts to people he even has floated this idea of gee
10:03
wouldn't it be nice if we could just get rid of the income tax entirely in this country and replace it with tariffs
10:09
which um has a lot of problems as a a way to raise revenue but is you know
10:14
theoretically possible and would be a massive restructuring of our tax code so so there's a really Stark difference
10:21
between these guys on taxes yeah that makes sense you know the last bucket we had was jobs as you mentioned this has
10:27
been a period of job growth led by by Biden's Administration what should be the biggest difference that we think
10:32
about between Biden and Trump when it comes to the prospect of unemployment or employment considering the unemployment
10:38
rate's been fairly low I think it's you know both these guys are going to talk a big game about jobs they're both going
10:43
to talk about their jobs record Biden has the best jobs record of any modern president in large part because the
10:50
recovery from covid employment was so fast but even if you exclude that it's been a very strong record but Trump had
10:56
a strong jobs record too and I think you have a real contrast in how they kind of arrive at their belief that they've been
11:02
able to stimulate job growth and how they say they would do it going forward you know Trump is a he he talks in some
11:08
very classic Republican language of low taxes and low regulations are going to drive job growth but for Trump tariffs
11:15
are also a driver of job growth he wants stuff made in the United States with American jobs and he thinks the way to
11:21
do it is basically to make everything you buy from around the world more expensive so that we have to make it here Biden's doing some of that but he's
11:28
doing more sort of like I want more stuff made here and I'm going to subsidize it you know Biden has all
11:34
these tax breaks in the inflation reduction act all the climate tax braks for solar panel production and wind
11:40
turbines and hydrogen and all these electric vehicles and he really wants to
11:45
seed those new Industries here and to be subsidizing those jobs Trump would repeal a bunch of those incentives he
11:52
says and so theoretically that would have some real potential effects on job growth but Trump has different policies
11:58
he says would be stimulated job growth mhm again because it's such a different environment now than when either of them
12:03
took office it's hard to say oh yeah that policy is definitely the right one to go with the bigger question I think
12:09
if if you're a voter trying to judge the jobs thing is do I believe Joe Biden's
12:14
arguments that the jobs of the future are in these particular Industries Advanced manufacturing clean tech you
12:22
know electric vehicles if I do Biden has a real strategy for that and Trump very explicitly says we shouldn't be
12:28
targeting those but if you believe hey the jobs of the future just lie in trying to bring
12:34
American employment back from overseas with tariffs and other and tax cuts then
12:39
Trump is your guy got it yeah I guess I would ask as our last question like what would be the one question on the economy
12:46
you would ask the two of them on Thursday I mean I think you have to ask about prices because it's the thing that
12:52
people care the most about but I think you have to ask about it in a way that helps people understand what the choice
12:57
is going forward and not just blame game going back so I actually might start with the version of your first question
13:04
one of your first questions to me which is what specifically will you do in your
13:10
next term if you win in November to bring down inflation and how will that
13:17
work and then follow up pretty aggressively if Trump's just like well I had low inflation before I'll do it
13:24
again like that's not an answer tell me how and if Biden's just like well I'm going to make sure the government gets insulin costs down more so like okay
13:31
great but what about the rest of the costs yeah and I think it's time for a big National debate on what would be the right policies over the next four years
13:39
to try to bring inflation down low again because there are a lot of ways that you could exacerbate it again if you do a
13:45
big tax cut or a big spending increase without paying for it there's a real risk that it shoots up again yeah yeah
13:52
uh Jim thanks so much I appreciate you taking some time out and let's look to this debate with an eye for substance
13:58
fingers crossed fingers crossed man thanks so much for having me it was really [Music]
14:08
fun the first and most urgent action when we win will be the ceiling of the
14:15
Border stopping the invasion drill baby drill send Joe Biden's illegal aliens
14:23
back home we'll do all all of those things and we're going to have to do them fast two weeks ago I did what
14:30
Republicans and Congress refused to do I took action to secure our border that included restricting unlawful Crossings
14:36
at our Southern border making decisions on Asylum more quickly and so much more
14:42
the next issue I wanted to turn to was [Music]
14:49
immigration my name is zolan Kano Youngs I'm a White House correspondent and I've
14:55
been covering immigration policy over the Biden and Trump Administration ations so you're going to help us
15:00
understand the differences between Biden and Trump specifically on an issue that is at the top of mind for many voters
15:06
which is immigration can you take me through just a couple of the pressure points that are at this moment top of
15:13
mind uh for the White House sure sure so I think when you talk about how the
15:19
White House views the Border there's one metric that has stood out throughout the Biden administrations and that's that's
15:26
border crossings right um now Crossings have more than
15:36
dumbledor for that but it's important to remember that at the end of trump you know the pandemic essentially brought
15:43
everything to a halt it also you know completely deteriorated the economies in some of these nations in Central America
15:50
where many of these people are coming from plus you had natural disasters and then as well a changing administration
15:57
too interesting let's try to go through the differences between both candidates when it comes to both border policy and
16:03
broader immigration policy and let's start with President Biden what has he done in relationship to the border and
16:09
what is he promising to do in a possible second ter right on okay so I think it's
16:14
important to go back a little bit to the presidential campaign of 2020 Biden's
16:20
largely kind of the plans that he outlined for the Border was mainly attacking Trump for his policies and
16:27
then he comes into office and in those early months there were already signs of of somewhat backtracking right I mean I
16:34
remember during the transition he warned immigration Advocates hey it's going to take me time to lift these Trump beir
16:40
restrictions right and then we had honestly I would say for much of this first term at least the first half a
16:48
Reliance on some Trump erir restrictions when it came to the Border part of that was because the courts sort of slowed
16:54
down how much the bid Administration could reform that system but to simplify they were relying on Trump eror
17:00
restrictions including a CO era rule that essentially sealed the border to migrants so the bid Administration went
17:07
from demeaning kind of Trump's policies On the Border to embracing some of them that's right embracing some of them I
17:14
think what makes Biden a little bit complicated at the border is he may be incredibly sort of strict when it comes
17:21
to sort of traditionally people crossing the border but like he also put forward this policy uh that allows migrants to
17:28
apply for an appointment with an immigration officer on a smartphone app he has also relied on like this
17:35
temporary emergency program sort of known as parole to let thousands of
17:40
people into the country so on one hand you've got like the restrictive sort of I'm turning people away but on the other
17:46
hand you've got this Innovative approach to try and expand some legal Pathways
17:51
but politics kind of always wins in the end and recently we did see him issue an
17:57
executive order after getting derailed or blocked by the Senate and just facing
18:03
political pressure for years he did Issue an executive order recently that
18:08
essentially suspended Asylum to most migrants at the Southwest border largely
18:14
mirroring the Trump administration's attempt as well is there anything the Biden Administration has said what they
18:19
would do differently if they elected to a second term when it comes to the Border you know it's a little bit
18:25
unclear as of now kind of what the plans would be for second ter I'm going to be honest with you right now the reporting
18:32
really shows that they are just so focused on trying to neutralize sort of
18:38
Trump's attacks that Biden is an open border president which fueled into some of these recent actions but the one
18:45
Glimpse that we have heard from Biden even when he signed that recent
18:50
executive order limiting Asylum he acknowledged that there would be critics in his own party that want to see more
18:57
actions that support migrants immigrants and he did say give me time be patient with me yes and to that point we saw a
19:04
version of this in the past week with a big announcement for the White House announcing a change in policy that would
19:09
create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are the spouses of citizens and who've already
19:15
been in the country for more than 10 years sure so so this almost crystallizes Biden's approach to
19:20
immigration in a way if you are a migrant who is uh fleeing persecution or
19:27
poverty and is trying to cross the border Biden's essentially telling you that you have to wait and if you are an
19:33
undocumented family that has been in the United States for years working uh sending your kid to school he's
19:40
essentially saying that you will be protected for now and uh so it's that
19:45
difference between those coming outside the border and those who have been inside the country for for years now
19:52
okay well let's go through Trump in his first term what were the specific actions that he took to the border that
19:57
stick out the most and what is he promising when it comes to the Border in a possible second term yep yep okay so
20:04
Trump definitely prioritized enforcement and I would say the main difference with Biden is just was incredibly candid
20:11
about the use of deterrence and even cruelty at the border as a means for discouraging migrants to cross I mean
20:17
everyone knows about uh zero tolerance and family separation but there was a lot of other stuff done in the final two
20:24
years of trump even after his family separation policy was remain in Mexico might be one of the
20:31
more consequential policies essentially forcing migrants to wait in Mexico until
20:36
they get an appointment in a backlogged Immigration Court system when covid hit
20:42
they basically seized on it to Institute something called title 42 which essentially turned migrants away citing
20:49
a public health emergency but this also resulted in them initially dropping off
20:54
kids who crossed the border alone into Mexico even if they were from a central American country right that's a major
21:01
difference from even the way the Biden Administration used that that rule so that was term one essentially so what
21:08
has he promised about what he would do differently in the second term taking it to the next level completely I mean if
21:14
you thought if you thought it was extreme in term one I mean what me and my colleagues have basically heard is is
21:21
it would it would impose an even more severe level of sort of extreme policies
21:27
I mean uh one thing that he talked about doing in term one was citing the Insurrection act to
21:34
basically have the military police the Border um that's something that they are planning already and and his age have
21:42
been very kind of candid about he has you know talked about reinstituting a
21:47
lot of the policies uh from from term one including that coair rule but almost
21:53
in a more permanent Way by not citing covid but by citing other diseases such
21:58
as tuberculosis or what have you even though there's still a lack of data that or evidence that you know most of the
22:05
migrants crossing are sick so we're talking about a policy of escalation from Trump that would continue what we
22:11
saw in the first term but even kick it up to a different level what's the biggest difference between Biden and Trump looking forward when it comes to
22:18
the broader immigration system yeah so I think one thing that sometimes gets lost about Trump is even though a lot of the
22:24
rhetoric was about the border and illegal immigration he also limited and made
22:31
attempts to limit legal immigration yeah this is super important yeah yeah like one thing that I think that the
22:37
reporting shows is you would see a return to extreme vetting people
22:43
essentially go into an embassy and going through a process to try and get a visa to the United States Trump imposed a
22:49
bunch of extreme vetting from the smallest detail to just sprawling sort of policies right maybe if you left an
22:56
answer blank on an application that might mean that you need to start over now and and you need to basically
23:03
provide more paperwork and background that some people fleeing uh difficult situations in certain countries may not
23:09
have extreme betting critics would say resulted in an exacerbated backlog of
23:15
the overall system Biden when he came into office lifted those extreme vetting
23:20
policies he lifted other policies including one that basically said if you
23:26
were an immigrant likely to use government assistance programs think
23:31
like food stamps for example you could have your green card blocked and like make no mistake the system's still
23:37
incredibly backlogged now Democrats and Republicans would say that it's you know still broken but there were some of
23:44
those restrictions that were lifted under Biden you asked me about also what it would look like in term two for Trump
23:50
once again may not surprise you going to the next level in terms of restrictions here that extreme vetting would be back
23:57
so it make it hard harder for people to apply the quote unquote legal way or right way and you would also have a
24:03
major escalation of deportation strategy main difference from Biden to Trump
24:09
trump basically directed ice agents to I'm like in casual terms go after
24:14
everybody right don't be limited if they're undocumented Target them for deportation Biden instituted guidelines
24:22
that basically said focus on people with criminal backgrounds being undocumented isn't a reason enough for being deported
24:29
essentially or at least having the resources of ice go after you Trump is going to go back to that broad sort of
24:36
approach for ice but he also in a term too uh We've reported that they are
24:41
planning on creating mass detention facilities including uh getting Federal officials to help with deportations
24:48
outside of ice deputizing local police to go after uh undocumented immigrants
24:53
also you know churches schools which essentially under the Biden Administration have been sort of safe
24:59
zones you know let's not go and and send Ice agents into into schools or work
25:04
site raids uh that would all be on the table for a trump Administration as well
25:09
if you could sum it up what would you say is the biggest difference between President Biden and president Trump on
25:15
immigration you know I think President Biden is focusing on enforcement now and
25:21
that's where sort of the political momentum is but this is still somebody that came into office and proposed a
25:27
bill to establish a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants I do think this is an
25:34
Administration that the Border has been a thorn in their side which has depleted
25:42
momentum from their I think real intention to try and repair the overall
25:47
immigration system the Border isn't a thorn in the side for the Trump Administration it's something that
25:53
they're going to lean into in terms of basically hardening the overall borders of the United States Trump's goal is
26:01
going to be to limit the number of people who can come to the United States in a term two and I think
26:09
Biden's focus is hardening the Southwest border at
26:16
this time to hopefully build enough momentum to start to make incremental
26:23
changes to repair the overall system mhm mhm
26:29
thank you so much zolen we appreciate your time and we know you'll be tracking this and uh uh we'll check in on it
26:35
again before the election right on appreciate it being
26:44
here after the break abortion rights and foreign policy
26:49
[Music]
26:55
[Music]
27:09
many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights especially since I was proudly
27:16
the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal Scholars both
27:21
sides wanted and in fact demanded the ended row v Wade they wanted it
27:29
ended I me if Congress ever passes a band I will veto that
27:38
band elected Democratic Congress comml and I will make Ry way the law of the land
27:44
[Applause] again the next issue I wanted to understand was abortion rights and
27:52
specifically what Biden and Trump are both promising in the second term
27:59
my name is Lisa ler I'm a national political correspondent for the New York Times and I'm the author of a new book
28:04
called the fall of row in the rise of a new America that details the fall of row
28:10
and federal abortion rights in America I guess I wanted to start with the incumbent and Joe Biden what has the
28:17
Biden administration's major policy moves been on abortion in the first term
28:22
well look they can't bring back row that's not something they they're Limited in what they can do so they've tried to do things that protect you know
28:29
emergency care for pregnant people uh who may be misc caring we we have a case like that going you know that's up at
28:35
the suprem court because of a you know a Biden policy they've tried to protect
28:41
access to medication abortion which is accounts to the majority of abortions in the country and also is a way that
28:47
people in ban states can end their pregnancies they've tried to enforce certain laws through the
28:53
doj um they're coming up with workarounds yeah they're coming up with rounds and they're limited you know they
29:00
can't stop these State bans from happening in places controlled by conservative legislatures and they can't
29:06
restore row that would take you know a bill being passed by Congress and there isn't even agreement on what that bill
29:13
should look like yeah so what seemed to be um a more fruitful path potentially
29:18
fruitful path for Democrats and others who want to um expand abortion rights in
29:23
America is to go through these State referendums and work state byst state uh which is of course the strategy the
29:29
anti-abortion movement used for many many decades so so when we think about Biden and his promises on abortion the
29:36
thing that we hear him most often say in terms of cying roie Wade faces some serious political headwinds to put it
29:43
lightly but there is a kind of push from the party at large to think about State referendums like we saw in Arizona or
29:50
other means of kind of getting around Congressional inaction to make this happen yeah and you know uh vice
29:56
president Harris has had a lot of meetings with these state legislators to talk about how they can you know deal
30:01
with these bans or uh you see some efforts in States like Michigan to protect abortion rights and not just
30:07
abortion rights but go beyond that and protect access to contraception you know IVF and fertility treatments so there
30:14
are things happening um in the states particularly States led by democrats to try to um protect and and expand
30:21
abortion rights okay let's flip the coin and go to Donald Trump a much harder
30:26
question to ask here is what is his stance on abortion well what he said is basically he takes credit for appointing
30:33
the justices who overturn row and he sees that as a historic victory in some ways but he also believes that should be
30:40
left to the states he said that if a 15 we Federal ban reached his desk he would
30:46
veto it he's promised to protect IVF infertility treatments but he's been a
30:51
little shaky on some of the other specifics you know things like medication abortion and weather States
30:58
could track the pregnancies or prosecute women who have abortions in places where it's banned um he's sort of given
31:05
conflicting answers on those topics and in some ways it's you know it's an issue that like Biden he's really moved all
31:12
over the map on and in some ways is uncomfortable with how should we go
31:17
about what to trust on Donald Trump's beliefs with abortion how much power
31:23
would the anti-abortion wing have in a trump second turn it's really hard to
31:28
say but you know I think we can anticipate that they would have a fair amount of power many of the people who
31:34
remain close to Donald Trump have been very uh strong opponents of abortion throughout their careers they had
31:41
prominent positions in the first Trump Administration if there was a second Trump Administration they could be um
31:47
put in spots at the Department of Justice or HHS where they could enforce
31:52
um fairly restrictive laws on the procedure and you know there's sort of ways that can um effectively create a
32:01
federal abortion ban without having to go through Congress do um well they can enforce the comto ACT U which would ban
32:08
the mailing of medication abortion and even potentially tools used like speculums or tools used in abortion and
32:15
if that were to be enforced that could end up being sort of a de facto Federal
32:20
ban in a way we don't know if they'll do that we've heard conflicting signals from people who have advised
32:27
conservatives and uh Trump on policy so you know it's hard to say exactly how this would shake out but we do know in
32:35
the first Trump Administration anti-abortion uh activists and people with a long history of being involved in
32:40
that cause had prominent jobs M now if Donald Trump wins again and if he puts
32:47
those same people in those same kind of positions or gives them even more power they will be operating in a radically
32:53
different political environment and so that's the wild card here MH thank you so much Lisa this was really helpful and
33:00
uh enjoy your debate watch tonight thanks you [Laughter]
33:06
[Music] too last America is
33:12
back America is back diplomacy is back
33:17
at the center of our foreign policy we wanted to talk about foreign policy we will return the world to peace through
33:25
strength and it'll happen very quickly I will revive American strength abroad and
33:30
we will restore American strength at
33:38
home I'm David Sanger I'm the White House and National Security correspondent for the times and the
33:45
author most recently of a book called new cold Wars China's rise Russia's
33:51
Invasion and America's struggle to defend the West I wanted to start with
33:56
what's happened since October 7th in Gaza and in Israel it really seems to have overtaken the biggest portions of
34:03
the foreign policy conversation in this race I know it's complex but can you give me an overview of the
34:09
administration's current policy as it pertains to the Israeli government and
34:14
its current um campaign in Gaza so Biden started this off with a
34:20
great Embrace of the Israelis as you would expect for somebody who views himself rightly so as a major friend of
34:27
of Israel for 50 years but if you go back to his first visit days after the
34:33
October 7 terror attack on Israel after announcing great support he then said to
34:40
the Israeli people you are running a big risk and the risk you're running is making the mistake that we made after
34:48
911 and that mistake is that we did a number of things in the name of
34:54
counterterrorism that later on we came to regret and the world came to regard
34:59
as huge oversteps if not war crimes and of course that is exactly the problem
35:07
that he faces now with the Netanyahu government and we're not entirely certain of the number dead in Gaza the
35:14
Palestinians say roughly 37,000 some portion of that presumably
35:21
were militants but obviously a huge number of them were not our civilians or
35:26
women our children and I think Joe Biden realizes now by
35:32
having misjudged the degree of the reaction within his own party particularly on the left of his own
35:38
party that he is being held morally responsible for the fact that Us weapons
35:43
were used in many of those attacks and so he is grappling with that and trying
35:49
to get Netanyahu into a place where Netanyahu agrees to a ceasefire that
35:55
would lead to a prisoner swap and then a more permanent ceasefire he announced
36:00
this at the very end of May and said it was an Israeli proposal which it was although the United States helped push
36:07
it along his problem is that just this past weekend Netanyahu himself stood up
36:15
and seemed to walk away from some big principles of what was supposed to be the proposal that he and his War cabinet
36:22
approved the result is Biden goes into this debate finding himself in the
36:29
perfectly middle spot where people are angry at him at both ends of very
36:36
pro-israel let the Israelis do whatever they want are coming after him and saying you're not supporting Israel
36:41
enough and the left is saying you're not restraining the Israelis from killing civilians and you have the blood on
36:48
their hands as you mentioned President Biden has kind of increasingly sharpened
36:53
his criticisms of the Netanyahu government in an attempt to hold them I guess more verbally or rhetorically
36:59
accountable how successful has it been considering you know you're talking about a walk back just as recently as
37:05
this weekend so most of what he was doing with Netanyahu was behind the
37:11
scenes because it's very much in Joe Biden's DNA that you work out these kind
37:16
of agreements particularly on delicate National Security issues quietly between leaders he got more and more angry at
37:24
Netanyahu and Netanyahu more and more angry at him it's pretty clear who Netanyahu wants to win in this coming
37:32
election Netanyahu wants Donald Trump to be elected president again because it
37:39
was a very rare day that Donald Trump stood in his way that's where I'm going
37:45
next yeah so if that's President Biden's relationship to Israel and Gaza what do
37:51
we know about Donald Trump what has he said and more importantly do we know anything about how a potential Trump
37:59
Administration would change their relationship to government or conflict if he were to win in
38:05
November Trump has said very little about Gaza yeah he initially hinted that
38:11
he would be completely behind Netanyahu but at various moments he said well maybe the Israelis have gone a little
38:17
bit far but you know he gets away with a huge amount of vague statements I mean
38:24
this is the usual arm waving of the Trump presidency so we don't know for
38:30
sure but what we can work from is what happened during his term in office from
38:36
2017 to 2021 pretty much he allowed Netanyahu to do what he wanted to do but he also was
38:44
responsible mostly through his son-in-law and a team that was working
38:50
around him for the Abraham Accords which began to bring Arab states into a uh
38:58
actual recognition and and peaceful resolution with the Israelis Biden was trying to build on
39:06
that before the October 7th attacks and still is by trying to bring in the
39:12
biggest element of this which would be Saudi Arabia so to be clear though if
39:17
you are a voter right now who is upset with the current situation in Gaza and believes that Biden has empowered
39:24
Netanyahu on an offensive assault that has killed too many pal Ian civilians there is not evidence that Donald Trump
39:31
as president would curb those actions in fact quite to the contrary he would probably undo the few things that Biden
39:38
has done in that regard I was just wanting that to be clear I mean it seems like the Netanyahu interest is one that
39:45
tell us all we need to know I also wanted to talk to you about the policy differences between Biden and Trump when
39:50
it comes to Ukraine obviously this conflict has engulfed a lot of the political conversation in the leadup to
39:57
this presidential election year but is also shows the big differences between the parts of the Republican Party who
40:04
have pitched isolation and the Democratic party who has been some of Ukraine's most ENT and vocal supporters
40:10
wouldn't we think about the policy differences between Biden and Trump on something like Ukraine and the conflict
40:16
there how would you describe it well from the very start of the 2016 campaign
40:23
former president Trump made it very clear including the me and Maggie Haberman during our two foreign policy
40:30
interviews with him that he did not regard Ukraine as something worthy of
40:36
American defense the country was corrupt he said he's certainly right about that
40:41
he maintained that the Europeans weren't as interested as we were in defending it
40:46
that has turned out to be wrong and he basically said let the Europeans go deal
40:53
with it it's their continent and this became sort of the heart of America first um thinking later on when the
41:01
invasion happened his party reacted reflexively to providing funding for
41:08
pushing back on Russia until a sort of trump core came to the four and
41:15
basically said this isn't our battle and that was very much a reflection of trump
41:20
thinking the Biden view on the other hand has been the exact opposite it has
41:25
been that Ukraine for all of its flaws is an emerging democracy that it's the
41:31
core of American values that the US stand up for democracies but also that
41:36
if the Russians win in Ukraine they will not stop there and it will become a
41:42
threat to NATO countries that we are treaty bound to go and defend and
41:48
therefore if we failed on Ukraine we would be repeating the mistake we made
41:54
in the runup to World War I and the runup to World War War II where there was a big isolationist movement the fact
42:01
of the matter is that at its fundamentals this is an argument between
42:07
a Joe Biden who says if America is not there to fill the vacuums someone else
42:13
will and that someone right now will be the Russians or the Chinese and a trump
42:18
argument that these are not America's battles and we should erect High walls
42:24
and if anybody comes after us we'll just whack them which is the core of sort of an
42:29
isolationist view that is a helpful summary and it also feels reflective of where both of those individuals and
42:36
wings of party were at the beginning of the conflict have we seen President Biden shift any considering we've seen
42:41
some public sentiment shift in the time that it's been going on so Biden if anything has doubled down with one
42:48
exception he will not allow Ukraine to join NATO while the war
42:55
is on because that would bring American troops directly in so Biden has had two
43:02
major strategic objectives here the first one is don't let the Russians win
43:09
and the second one is don't get into World War II and it's the World War II
43:15
part of it that has led to his hesitation to arm Ukraine with
43:21
everything it asked for when it asked for it because Biden always said our our
43:27
arms can't be used against Russians on Russian territory or that will take us
43:33
down a nuclear escalation path yeah yeah what we know would be Donald Trump's
43:38
position on Ukraine if he were to get a second term for Trump he has said
43:43
somewhat vaguely that he would solve this problem in 24 hours now he has
43:50
never told us how he was going to solve the problem in 24 hours the only way I can think of of solving this issue in 24
43:58
hours is calling up Vladimir Putin and saying okay you can keep all the lands
44:05
that you've already taken which is roughly plus or minus 20% of Ukraine I
44:11
think you'll also hear Trump say well Vladimir Putin didn't do this kind of invasion of Ukraine while I was
44:19
President he respects me too much or fears me too much in order to go do this
44:25
and I think that will sound a healing to his supporters it has very little
44:31
factual base about why it is that Putin did not invade the majority of Ukraine
44:37
he simply wasn't ready to during the Trump years the last kind of uh for policy
44:43
bucket that seems likely to come up in this debate is the United States relationship with China how would you describe how each one of these figures
44:50
has position their administrations in terms of its relationship to China and what would you say is the most important
44:55
thing for the next 4 years in terms of that relationship former president Trump
45:01
thinks almost purely in terms of economics and economic punishment his
45:07
favorite thing is tariffs and so he has said he would put huge tariffs on basically all Chinese Goods Biden has
45:15
gone about something quite different he has said look there are some things we
45:20
need to keep the Chinese from doing and that is to stop the Chinese from getting
45:25
the most high-tech conductors the kind of equipment to make them that would
45:31
Empower them to make military equipment of the highest uh end type and to make
45:38
progress in artificial intelligence Quantum Computing all of that of which
45:43
semiconductors Advanced semiconductors are the core to all of this so I think that what you're going to hear from
45:50
Biden is he's going to say I have come up with a way to deprive the Chinese of the most Advanced Technologies with
45:57
without triggering huge inflation by taxing Chinese Goods with a big tariffs
46:02
and I think that uh president Trump will uh come in and say that he is going to
46:09
teach the Chinese a lesson by putting tariffs on everything preserving gasoline powered cars you know so forth
46:17
and so on if you could sum up the biggest difference between Biden and Trump when it comes to a possible second
46:23
term and what their role as president would be what would you say say is the biggest difference specifically in the
46:29
in the arena of how we relate to others so I think Biden would tell you
46:35
that his fundamental philosophy is that the world is too big and complex for the
46:41
United States to manage alone and too expensive to do that and therefore he
46:47
has focused on America's greatest single power which is its ability to build
46:54
alliances for Trump if you're big and you're tough and you're strong the world
47:00
will respect you they won't mess with me and they've been messing with Joe Biden
47:06
and so I think that a trump second term would be the enactment of America first
47:12
which is also to say sort of America alone he talked about it a lot in the first term he did not know how to pull
47:19
those levers and he surrounded himself because he didn't know the foreign policy Community with some people who he
47:25
thought fit the look of what a secretary of state or a secretary of defense would look like
47:32
but who had turned out were actually interested in engaging in the world yeah right he's not going to make that
47:38
mistake again he's going to pick loyalists who sign up for his view of
47:45
America First for Biden I think the biggest concern that he's running into
47:50
is that his form of quiet incremental diplomacy has not yielded
47:57
the kind of clear victories for America that he would like to be able to go
48:03
advertise so I think there is going to be a a critique of him that he's a bit
48:10
out of gas now his best argument and response to that is imagine what Ukraine
48:16
would look like if Joe Biden had not organized the world to defend it yeah Beyond chaos you would have had Russian
48:24
forces right on NATO's border mhm yep
48:29
David thank you so much for your time and for your expertise we really appreciate it and we'll be watching the debate with this landscape in mind I'm
48:36
not sure that we might get more policy uh discussion from this than we do from them on that stage but we'll see we'll
48:41
be hopeful well let's hope
48:47
[Music] yeah tonight's debate will underscore the massive Stakes of this
48:53
election policy-wise Biden is largely prom see more of the same and Trump
48:59
threatens to up in everything from the political system to the immigration system and our relationship with foreign
49:07
allies but on the big stage debates are often judged by how the candidates look
49:13
and sound so good policy won't guarantee a win they'll need a sound bite to present
49:20
well and somehow to convince the millions of Voters desperate for other
49:26
options to get excited about the ones they [Music]
49:50
