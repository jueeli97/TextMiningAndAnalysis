What Republicans Lost When They Won on Roe


0:01
we're going to start on the street right over here looked a little bit more shady to me today's not too bad though thankfully
0:09
the breezes make it nice yeah yesterday was so hot it's another spring Day in
0:15
Arizona and once again we're following around a group of organizers trying to
0:20
reach voters on this November ballot initiative that would in trying the right to an abortion in the Arizona
0:26
state constitution but these organizers Catherine and Heather are targeting a
0:32
more conservative suburb of Phoenix and they're trying to convince people not to support the initiative to the ballot
0:38
yeah and you work at students for life I work for students for Life yeah how old are you I'm 21 okay how old are you I'm
0:43
16 you're 16 wow um how did you get involved in this I got involved through a club that's at my school I joined two
0:52
years ago a year and a half ago because they started it up and I was like oh this is really cool student for Life Club at school yeah was that high school
0:58
or was that Middle School for me it was 8th grade yeah it was eighth grade yeah Middle School yeah so we do a lot with
1:05
all all ages and we also have like Community things as [Music] well for decades the Republican position
1:13
on abortion rights was crystal clear overturn roie Wade and send the issue
1:19
back to the States but since June of 2022 when the Supreme Court's
1:24
conservative majority did exactly that Republicans have faced the question what
1:30
comes next in Arizona that question is especially
1:35
important because in this Battleground state democratic groups have already mobilized around this ballot initiative
1:42
which is expected to motivate a wide range of Voters to show up in November and could be a boost for
1:50
Biden so after spending time with organizers who support the ballot measure this week we explored the
1:57
anti-abortion movement in Arizona where a powerfully motivated group of conservatives in the state is continuing
2:04
to push against the initiative and punishing the Republicans who have sought a more moderate position on the
2:11
issue today in part two of our reporting from Arizona how abortion rights are
2:17
exposing the fractures on the right from the New York Times I'm estad
2:22
hearnen this is the run up
2:33
the street was your typical Arizona suburb quiet not much grass some palm
2:38
trees even an orange tree no one answered at the first few houses we can't answer the door right
2:46
now but if you'd like to leave a message you can do it now but Heather and Catherine left some flyers anyway we'll
2:52
just leave the information on your door the most awkward part is when they
2:58
like you're walking away and then then they open the door and you have to decide am I going to go back and talk to
3:03
them or just be like I left it on your door how do you decide depending on how
3:08
welcoming they open the door if they're like hello a lot of it sounds like journalism familiar I used to have to do
3:14
a lot of door knocky and you're lot reading Vibes in the moment so many
3:23
Vibes eventually did some yeah yeah what can I do for you hi someone open the door
3:30
we're informing people about their local Pregnancy Resource Centers have you heard of any in your area no no we can just give you the
3:38
information if you're interested okay all right these Pregnancy Resource Centers offer free diapers formula
3:44
pregnancy tests anything that a woman could need during her pregnancy they also offer like paternal classes um for
3:51
men who are helping their partner and then we also have this um this is our decline to sign information have you
3:57
heard of the ballot initiative that's going around in Arizona right now for abortion access yeah don't wor El sign
4:03
that when I find it oh so we're actually encouraging people not to sign it um why
4:08
generally speaking so this will allow abortion up until the moment of birth is that something that you're comfortable
4:14
with uh no most people aren't so that's kind of like we're offering that information it'll also remove the
4:20
parental consent law so the parental consent law doesn't allow minors to be taken in to get abortions without
4:26
parental consent if that law is removed then it'll allow people that are trafficking children to go in get there
4:32
stop with that stupid [ __ ] argument okay that's a dumbass [ __ ] argument yes I will support this bill actually
4:38
thank you have a good
4:44
day all right how often do you get responses
4:50
like that not very often most of the time people are very receptive because
4:55
they do have kids and they're like oh I wouldn't want my daughter who's 13 years old be able to go in and get an abortion
5:01
without me knowing about it you know the bill is technically 24 weeks yes the
5:07
viability and viability and then it has some exceptions that are expanded from otherwise yeah so it says up until
5:14
viability but you can't interfere after for health of the mother but health of the mother is defined so broadly it
5:20
could literally just mean oh I don't like that I gained weight from being pregnant which is like a natural consequence that's what you're saying is
5:25
leading to argument you're saying it's up until birth because the law is technically 24 weeks so it is written in a way that persuades
5:32
people to think that it's 24 weeks but when we really break down the language it would allow it up until the moment
5:37
because the exceptions are are soora right yeah this argument that Heather makes that the ballot initiative's
5:44
language would allow abortion up to the moment of birth it's misleading and it's
5:49
one that abortion rights groups reject current state law permits abortion up to 15 weeks the Arizona
5:56
ballot measure would allow abortion up until the point of of fetal viability which is usually defined around 24 weeks
6:05
less than 1% of all abortions happen after 24 weeks and under the ballot
6:10
measure any exemption following viability will require sign off from a medical professional but that didn't
6:17
stop Heather and Catherine from making the argument let's definitely try to that somebody come back so we walked up
6:25
to a house that had the sign out front it said grandkids welcome parents By
6:33
Appointment hi how's your day going okay that's where we met Vicky hi we're
6:38
informing people about their local Pregnancy Resource Centers have you heard any in your area well no yeah these um Pregnancy
6:46
Resource Centers offer free pregnancy tests free ultrasounds free stuff after
6:51
you have babies and even during your pregnancy would you we can give you both of these we're also asking people if
6:57
they've heard about the Arizona for abortion access act yes so we're asking people how they
7:03
feel about that I am against abortion okay awesome the king of babies we're
7:10
out here asking people not to sign for that you would allow abortion up until the moment of birth and it's something
7:15
that's really scary and that we don't want to see happen to Arizona so we're very grateful for your support so we
7:21
also have the New York Times with us if you have a minute for to share your hi you know
7:28
opinion just said this this is Caitlyn we're work for the New York Times we actually work for its politics podcast and we're following them around today
7:34
partially to talk to arizonans about how they're feeling not only about this referendum about the election because Arizona is such an important state maybe
7:40
have a couple minutes I'm just curious on how like you know we're about to come into a very crazy election period like
7:45
how do you how are you feeling about that how I'm feeling about the election
7:51
just just like just like Blue Sky first word that comes to your mind I I feel that many people are
7:58
deceived in don't really understand everything that's going on and that
8:03
they'll listen to regular news that is not reporting both sides sad to say one
8:10
the reasons frightens me one of the reasons we like talking to people so they can tell us what they think we're missing like what do you think are the
8:16
things that folks aren't reporting on that you're saying you wish they you heard more about the other side I mean so many
8:24
times they'll report like with abortion they'll report about oh you know we want
8:30
to have more abortions we want to make it available for people but they're not reporting what actually happens during
8:37
an abortion or like Israel they'll say oh these poor people in Palestine and
8:44
everything nothing about the hostages that were abducted or you know how
8:49
Israel is just trying to protect themselves and keep from being annihilated do you have an issue that
8:55
you think is most important for you in this election I guess those are my two most important
9:02
ones right now yeah can I ask you about the specific candidates when you think about Trump and Biden likely to be on the ballot again from 2020 like do you
9:09
know how you're going to vote are you a Democrat Republican do you consider yourself one of those identities there's a lot of corruption
9:17
on both sides but I will not vote for Biden I mean he has just totally
9:24
destroyed this country and he keeps sending money to people it's it they won't to kill us and annihilate us and
9:31
then open borders when you have so many people that you don't know where they're from and the fet and all that's
9:38
happening and the child um not prostitution but human trafficking and
9:44
you know all of this that's going on and then him and his son and he is very
9:51
corrupt and I do not want him president well I have a question about Trump you mentioned how you feel about Biden how
9:56
do you feel about Donald Trump well if he's the only one running then yes I will I think that he did an awesome job
10:03
as a president um he did a lot of stuff that again the media just sort of
10:09
overlooked he says stuff that he shouldn't say I want to smack him for that you know but he did so much good
10:15
our economy was better just overall one things that's been interesting to me
10:21
about Trump is he's backed away from endorsing a federal end abortion ban and he's recently kind of uh been like a
10:27
couple other Republicans who stepped back from really leading on a pro-life stance does that as someone who feels
10:35
strongly about abortion like does that bother you any that he seems to have
10:40
stepped away from that I wish he hadn't and yes it bothers me but being the man
10:47
he is he is out for votes and sad to say a lot of people support abortion so I do
10:55
not agree with Trump not really reporting it full
11:01
full-heartedly but I understand why he's doing it because for because many people
11:08
that is a deciding factor for them if they can't have an abortion then they don't want that person in even if it
11:15
means that that person is going to totally destroy America I mean I do think that a lot of Elections have told
11:21
us that people are prioritizing that issue at the top one question I have for you is Arizona has changed so much to
11:27
become a swing state you know there's been a lot of influx of new folks I don't know how long you have been in this state or anything I guess I was
11:32
just wondering has that been tangible I mean has it does Arizona feel like it's changing because the numbers would tell
11:38
us that it's becoming a little more liberal that it's becoming more open to Democrats it definitely has become more
11:45
liberal and I've been talking to my husband about moving because too many
11:51
Californians came with their liberal ideas they didn't like what happened to California but then they come here and
11:57
they still want the same thing and destroy our state it's it makes me angry
12:04
but we all should have the right to vote as we feel how long have you been in
12:10
Arizona since 84 thank you so much you mind telling us like your name or how old you are my
12:16
name is Vicki I'm in my 70s that's all good that's all take we'll take it we
12:23
good thank you yeah thank you so much we really appreciate it my name is Heather I work with students for life of America
12:28
so well God bless you oh thank you I just wanted to say like we're so grateful for your support So yeah thank
12:34
you yeah don't leave we need all of our Republican voters here we have a daughter and three grandchildren that
12:40
said no you can't go Grandma you have to say yeah you're prob I see your son clearly the
12:46
child Vicki is representative of a lot of Republican voters right now who may
12:51
not love that Donald Trump is rejecting the idea of a federal ban on abortion
12:56
but who are unlikely to punish him for it but not everybody in the Republican Party gets a pass from the anti-abortion
13:04
movement in fact on days when they're not canvasing against the ballot initiative students for life have begun
13:12
to Target a Republican state legislator named Matt grass who had up until
13:18
recently been on their side now they're handing out flyers with
13:23
his face on them that say wanted for the death of countless Arizona pre-born
13:28
babies and we wanted to talk to him about why he's become a lightning ride you have a
13:34
good rest of your day yeah nice meeting you nice meeting you have a great day so we said goodbye to Heather and Catherine
13:41
and met up with gr do we sound okay how do we feel you
13:47
guys are sound great um you have a nice podcast voice you have a great podcast
13:55
voice in a conference room at our hotel in Phoenix right biest District um can
14:00
you just introduce yourself and tell us what you do yes uh my name is Matt Gres and I'm a state representative in the
14:07
Arizona House representing Scottdale Arcadia Paradise Valley and North
14:13
Phoenix Gres is in his first term as a state legislator but he worked in state government before that under Republican
14:20
Governor Doug Ducey when he initially ran his platform didn't have much to do
14:25
with abortion it was about education I'm I'm a former school teacher getting more
14:32
money into the classroom um safe neighborhoods ensuring that we are
14:38
supporting our police as well as addressing the serious issues down in
14:43
the border and then just keeping taxes and regulations low and appropriate then
14:50
on April 9th that's when everything changed completely I did not it was not
14:57
on my bingo card April 9th is when the Arizona Supreme Court moved to change
15:02
the landscape of abortion Reviving an 1864 law that had been on the books
15:08
since before Arizona was a state a law that banned any abortion at any time
15:13
except if the mother's life was in danger yeah can you tell me like what was the immediate reaction when the law
15:20
went into place so within a few hours of the Court ruling I came out with uh a
15:26
video I posted it and BAS Al said that I do not believe that the Supreme Court's
15:32
ruling can stand and that the legislature now needs to engage and
15:37
repeal the territorial law because it is not in alignment with the values of arizonans in 2024 Gres was initially the
15:44
only Republican in the state house to side with Democrats and pushing to repeal the law eventually two other
15:51
Republicans joined him and the law was overturned but Gress made some enemies
15:56
in the process the Rea action from
16:02
Republicans was conflicted because many of my Republican colleagues who did not
16:08
vote with me acknowledged why I was doing what I was doing they saw the rationale they
16:15
obviously did not agree with me and we're going to have to agree to disagree on on this particular issue those people
16:23
in the Republican caucus the ones who believe the 1864 law should stand punish
16:28
grass for his vote if I understand correctly you were removed from the Appropriations Committee after this vote
16:35
right yes I was I mean that's not a small thing did the intensity of the
16:40
blowback surprise you
16:46
any maybe um it I
16:52
mean I really applaud the senate for keeping their cool on this there were
16:59
members of the Senate that wanted Senator schope and Senator bollock to be
17:04
removed from leadership posts the other folks who joins with Democrats to REM to
17:09
corre repeal the on the Senate side and they said well the speaker punished Matt
17:15
grass you need to punish these other Republicans in the Senate and the Senate President Warren Peterson said that's
17:21
not how the Senate Works each member gets to vote the way that they believe their District wants them to vote and
17:27
we're not going to punish them for that so it's um I think it's unfortunate but
17:33
I don't work for the speaker I work for the people of the fourth legislative district and I'm going to continue to do
17:39
what they want me to do yeah not just on this but on other issues as well the thing is Gress really believes he's
17:46
helping his party win and that's what I ultimately wanted to talk to him about
17:51
for you as a republican what have the conversations been like amongst the party about how to find a position that
17:58
that both speaks to values and has political relevance I think for too long
18:06
we have seen the extremes on both ends want to pit women
18:13
against new life I don't think that it's a mutually exclusive situation I think we can
18:20
respect women and have policies that protect New Life working simultaneously
18:26
together there's no doubt there are deeply held views on the existential
18:33
question of abortion and I'm not going to dismiss what some of my colleagues believe or or view on Banning abortion
18:42
outright I'm against abortion and yet I also recognize that abortion is
18:48
necessary with reasonable time frames and reasonable exceptions I mean it is
18:55
undeniable that that needs to be available to women going through certain circumstances especially in the horrific
19:03
situations of rape or incest I think I took the most pro-life position that was available what do you
19:10
mean so if we were to allow the zero week territorial law to remain in place
19:17
we would have created the perfect conditions for the Arizona abortion access to pass overwhelmingly in
19:24
November you're saying if that law was still there it would be easier for the progressive activists who are trying to
19:31
push the referendum in November that would expand abortion access it would be
19:36
easier for that to pass if it was up against the 1864 law absolutely because you have nothing versus allowing
19:43
abortion to be legal and most people recognize that abortion has to be
19:49
available in those circumstances when it's warranted so we were going to
19:54
create the perfect condition for an in my view a pretty extreme measure like
20:01
the abortion access act to pass overwhelmingly we have to be strategic
20:06
here because I think that most people are in the middle and I think that since
20:12
roie Wade was decided in 1973 we have done a very bad job on the Republican
20:19
side of winning the hearts and minds of Americans uh winning them over to the
20:26
pro-life side repic an have kind of they
20:31
had an easy out before roie Wade was overturned to say yeah roie Wade should
20:36
be overturned and that was it because no one thought that it would get overturned
20:43
so you didn't really have to do the policy exercise at what happens if roie
20:48
Wade was overturned where do you want the law to stand if it was over to exactly and we didn't we as Republicans
20:56
didn't have to do the work around thinking through real life
21:01
implications of having a policy that is workable and reflective of the reality
21:08
on the ground and that aligns with the values of the people we serve and then
21:14
there are those who are like this is a matter of principle this is a matter of
21:20
moral conviction and despite what the electorate thinks we have to stand firm
21:26
on our principles we've been fighting for outlawing abortion for all of this time now is the time to stand firm a
21:34
life is a life yeah I was going to ask about what you do with the kind of moral conviction slice of your party because
21:41
it's not insignificant you know that's a driving activist in energy based for a lot of Republicans and we've talked to
21:47
so many activists both in Arizona and nationally who describe this in such
21:53
human rights terms that there is no for them sense of compromise can you describe
21:59
how that was received by that wing and then in a larger way what can Republicans do if that group never
22:08
budges well that group does not represent the majority of the party and
22:15
maybe it's going to take this election to show some of these individuals and even some of them have acknowledged that
22:21
they are in the minority they acknowledge that but they have deeply held beliefs and again I'm not going to
22:28
dismiss that but I'm not going to go along with that it's not appropriate for
22:33
my constituency and when you're talking about
22:39
widespread policy shifts like completely Banning abortion after it had been legal
22:44
for 50 years it it just do not the electorate
22:50
the governed are not going to shift like that MH yeah you know from our perspective there's a lot of interest in
22:56
how this could affect a presidential race what do you think about that Prospect like is is the reason this is happening now also to help Joe Biden win
23:03
in Arizona I'm not sure I'm not sure the
23:09
reason why um proponents picked 2024 to run the Arizona abortion AOS act but
23:15
that's the only issue that the Democrats have to run on it's not the Border it's not foreign policy it's not the
23:23
economy I mean I'm I'm straining to think what
23:29
else the Democrats have to run on the problem is that voters are not
23:34
single-issue voters they have a host of concerns and right now president Trump
23:41
is in Arizona is leading President Biden and his views and viewpoints especially
23:48
when it comes to the Border are resonating with arizonans the Democrats can continue to try to focus on abortion
23:54
to hopefully win additional votes but their absence and apathy on the border
24:01
is what will ultimately do them in in November so I I think you know as long
24:06
as we stay focused on being responsive to where our constituents want us to be
24:14
and being able to talk about abortion in a responsible way yeah I do think that
24:20
Republicans have the edge yeah in in one way I see how when you're saying that's all the Democrats have to run on it also
24:26
makes it seem like that's the vulnerability for republicans and that abortion and that the lack of kind of a
24:34
consistent message or a lack of maybe a clear position on what to do going
24:39
forward is maybe the sticking point when we think about optimism come November do you think by the time we get there
24:46
Republicans will be United behind 15 weeks or would there still be you know the human rights faction versus another
24:52
faction or specifically on abortion I I think that the pro-life C Coalition will
24:59
come together the fact is the 15we law is the law of the land for all intents
25:05
and purposes we repealed the territorial law is gone so now the pro-life movement
25:11
has to think okay we could have a constitutional amendment that enshrines abortion in the Constitution or we can
25:18
fight to defend the 15we law which was good back in 2022 that was considered
25:23
very pro-life I think that's where the pro-life faction are going to ultimately
25:30
end up they're upset right now but my hope is that they will see the bigger
25:36
picture but we got to be focused on talking about abortion in that way
25:42
versus continuing to advocate for its complete ban and elimination that's just not where voters are going to be yeah
25:49
yeah great thank you so much I really appreciate it and I think this was really helpful for us okay thank you
25:54
have a great day too safe travel thank you
25:59
for grass the most pro-life thing a republican can do is find a consensus
26:05
position on abortion rights that meets voters where they are where some abortions are allowed up until a
26:12
reasonable time frame and with reasonable exceptions and his thinking seems to
26:17
mirror trumps it's pragmatic and calibrated for Republicans to win
26:23
elections but there's another group that has an increasingly loud voice in this debate pushing more Extreme Measures
26:31
where people like grass see compromise these are the abortion abolitionists the radicals who refuse to
26:39
give an inch and in doing so are boxing the Republican party
26:44
in that's after the [Music]
26:54
break I think you're going in there a couple days after after talking with Gress and going out with students
27:00
for Life Caitlyn and I drove to tempy Arizona to an unassuming office whose
27:06
location we've been asked to keep private where we were there to meet the pastor
27:12
of apologia Church a church focused on anti-abortion advocacy it also has a studio space
27:19
where they broadcast their message to more than 500,000 YouTube followers the
27:25
studio space was in the back of the building and that's where we said up just a minute that's okay I totally
27:32
understand take your time there we go good there were classic movie posters on the wall next to another poster that
27:39
said babies are murdered here can you introduce yourself on Mike yeah uh can you just just tell me what you do yeah
27:46
I'm Pastor Jeff Durban pastor at apologia church I'm also the head of end abortion now and apologia Studios cool
27:53
Jeff Durban is 46 a father of seven including three adopted children
27:59
his wife and their two newest babies were waiting in the lobby of the building as we spoke to him he's also a
28:05
grandfather of six and he has a colorful backstory yeah so I wasn't raised in an
28:12
explicitly Christian home and uh heard the gospel for the first time when I was 16 had a profession of Faith moved to
28:19
Arizona because at the time I was the national champion uh in martial arts I was a full-time professional competitor
28:26
and did a lot of different projects like when I was I turned 18 first thing I did was I was with Mortal Kombat the life
28:32
tour uh did a lot of different projects like stuff from the NRS franchise and video games and things like that so that
28:39
brought me out to Arizona to teach martial arts and be closer to LA and uh my life had a a real transformation
28:46
after about a year long pursuit of drug addiction drug and alcohol addiction God
28:51
got a hold my life and my heart and uh change my life Durban started apologia
28:56
Church in 2010 abortion issue he says about a thousand people come to services on a good day Durban and apologia have
29:04
become synonymous with anti-abortion activism in Arizona and what's called abortion
29:10
abolition yeah so the issue of abortion abolition is an issue that focuses in
29:16
upon equal protection for All Humans it's a focus upon consistency no
29:22
compromise um the Abolitionist says it is fully human and in the image of God
29:28
from fertilization and we must protect all humans and give them equal protection in durban's view people who
29:35
seek abortion should be punished abortion should be considered a crime it should be considered uh murder you're
29:42
unjustly taking the life of a human being and so that's murder and what I've said is what is the historic position of
29:49
the Christian church that if you take the life of a human being unjustly then
29:55
what the state owes you if it's proven and it's true true is capital punishment you forfeit your right to live however
30:02
in this nation right now we have strayed so far from just standards of accusation
30:08
and prosecution that I can't even say and I won't say that I want capital
30:13
punishment in any particular State because it could have an unjust system that leads to that capital punishment so
30:20
do I believe in capital punishment for murder 100% do I believe that we are in the place right now where we can employ
30:26
that with trust to our judicial system absolutely not members of durban's
30:31
church have done some things you'd expect like protesting at Planned Parenthood but one of the things that
30:37
makes them different is that they also Focus their efforts on pressuring conservatives who seek to compromise on
30:43
abortion rights the pro-life Lobby will really boast in the fact that they are not explicitly Christian they're opposed
30:50
to using uh the biblical world view biblical standards as explicit in the
30:55
legislature the pro-life establishment uh does not want to abolish abortion
31:00
they do not believe in equal protection for All Humans from fertilization though they say they do they do not so you'll
31:06
see pro-life legislation like um you can kill the children under 15 weeks but not
31:11
over or 12 weeks or heartbeat so the pro-life Lobby the pro-life establishment actually believes in
31:17
partiality they're inconsistent wholly inconsistent and that's the issue um I
31:23
really want to talk about actually the post doobs era but I think that was helpful context when the decision came
31:29
down what was your initial thoughts thankful that God strikes
31:34
straight blows with crooked sticks am I glad that row is out of the way VIA that decision I'm glad it's no longer going
31:40
to be able to be used as an excuse by pro-life legislators and leaders I
31:47
believe that the decision itself however was evil in terms of the
31:54
justices actually just washing their hands of it and saying to the States you decide if you want to kill them I don't
32:00
think that was a consistent or just decision I think that it was cowardly to be clear you're saying that the
32:06
delegation to the states is one you find cowardly because you would prefer them to just to Outlaw abortion directly I I
32:13
would I would prefer the Supreme Court be consistent even the judges that are have pro-life you know commitments that
32:19
they be consistent with how they address an issue like abortion and not simply say I believe it's fully human from
32:26
fertilization uh but I'll go ahead and let the states decide if they want to go ahead and oppress these human beings to
32:32
your point it has really thrown the Republican pro-life position in flux for so many years it was just the refrain of
32:40
eliminating row and now we have seen a kind of open question in a lot of States
32:46
about where a lot of these legislators fall this is a big issue here in Arizona
32:51
but I first wanted to ask about National folks too we've seen Donald Trump frankly step away from calls for federal
32:59
abortion ban we've seen Republican Cate K Lake step away from calls for a
33:05
federal abortion ban what is your reaction to just the way National or
33:10
kind of bigname Republicans who were pro-life and anti-abortion four or five
33:16
years ago have kind of become pro- State decide on its own yeah I think it's
33:21
demonstrating that a lot of these politicians are not as committed to the principles they say they are and they in
33:28
fact charlatans you know I believe this for votes I believe this for the crowd but I don't actually believe it in
33:33
principle and so I think what Donald Trump did uh and what how he came out was it exposes his inconsistency but it
33:40
also demonstrates that he doesn't really believe what he says he believes and the same for Cary Lake and so you're right
33:47
there's been a big revealing after dos uh as to whether or not people actually believe this I have no affinity for the
33:54
Republican Party my challenge to them all would be to say you guys don't
34:00
really believe what you say you believe you're inconsistent and that inconsistency is so obvious your
34:06
opposition knows you don't really believe it the pro-life establishment is not working for abolition in the end of
34:12
abortion they're not ultimately aimed at equal protection and abolishing abortion
34:18
like say we did slavery it's a crime it doesn't matter who does it there is no
34:23
one getting out of the justice that will be served if you kidnap and enslave any
34:29
of our black brothers and sisters you will be punished and we don't care who you are or where you're involved in the
34:35
process right you're all guilty and we're going to punish you that's abolition and uh these pro-lifers don't
34:42
actually want abolition MH like looking ahead to November in Arizona 1864 law is gone yep like what's the plan in terms
34:49
of the current political reality around abortion in Arizona yeah that's a good question so in terms of methodology and
34:56
strategy and in establishing Justice if you're consistent at the bottom you don't need to change your strategy
35:02
you're aiming at the same thing equal protection for every human being nobody is to be treated differently and so in
35:09
terms of what we're trying to do it's the same thing we've been doing bills of abolition equal protection in whatever
35:14
way we can get it but in terms of this ballot measure the ballot measure would mean that post row we would have the
35:23
bloodiest and most brutal part of this Holocaust just beginning from my perspective so it's very serious that we
35:29
we focus on the ballot measure um and we are we are working very very hard right
35:36
now around the clock and I cannot say what we're doing to make sure that this ballot measure doesn't take place um why
35:44
can't you say what you're doing U because there's too many people working on it and and I know that the opposition
35:50
has a lot of money and they have there's I'm not going to reveal the manem what my plans are and uh they're all peaceful
35:57
and all legal remedies to deal with the ballot measure but we're working very hard right now and there are a number of
36:02
organizations that are working together with us as a matter of fact apologia church is leading this and if we get to
36:09
the point where it is on the ballot or is the goal right now to just keep it off the ballot the goal right now is to
36:15
kill the ballot measure uhuh yeah um there's no Insight like legally or or
36:20
did not get enough signatures and validate the signatures we can't get any visibility there can't okay is there any
36:26
point of defeat here like if we get enough of these in a row like let's say Arizona
36:32
backs the access bill that is so far from abolition mhm would that change
36:38
anything that you all do no no because the problem is the same the message is the same and I keep bringing it back to
36:45
this just in terms of it's something fresh in many people's minds in terms of in our own nation's history it's the
36:51
people still feel the wounds from it right the issue of slavery there was a heck of a lot of resistance to the
36:57
abolition slavery and a lot of people saying this isn't going to end it's this is going to keep going and it was I
37:03
think just a grace of God that light really started to shine in people's hearts and Minds to love another person
37:08
like God calls us to and that's how it happened also a huge War well from and and where we are in
37:15
the Civil War yeah yeah and and I actually believe that the Civil War was judgment in our nation for doing such a
37:22
wicked thing for so long yeah uh do you vote yeah when I think about the
37:28
presidential election like how do you view this issue in terms of I imagine two choices now that at least in terms
37:34
of major party candidates have stepped away from the idea of a federal abortion
37:40
ban or really embracing abortion as a thing to be restricted at the national level where does that leave you so you
37:47
heard me say that I have no affections ultimately for the Republican party or anything like that I what I'm looking for is consistency and principle or
37:54
obviously from my perspective as a Christian as a pastor in it very difficult moment because it would seem
37:59
to be that both candidates whether it's Biden or Trump both have radically
38:05
unchristian worldviews on so many issues and so it becomes very challenging I'm
38:10
not saying that as a Christian you need to have the perfect candidate um but you're right on this issue it becomes
38:16
very challenging for someone like me um I don't idolize Trump I'm thankful for some of the things that he did that are
38:22
consistent with a Christian worldview I'm thankful for a lot of those things but at the same time I think it's important to call out where he is
38:27
inconsistent and where he demonstrates that I'm more concerned with votes than I am lives I think the idolatry of trump
38:34
amongst Christians in America is is shameful but but the I'm hearing he's more likely to get your vote Trump yeah
38:42
right now I do not have any position on it at the moment I'm hoping to see
38:48
light and consistency happen but um yeah the last question I have is it seems
38:55
like the Republican Party even though it's not something you personally identify with is in a rock in a hard
39:01
place partially because of the advocacy of abortion abolitionist you know that has historically been a huge energy and
39:08
activism base for them and a source of money lot of money and they have really calibrated their message around some of
39:16
that activism and it does seem like right now their desire to reposition is
39:22
being pulled from the desire to win votes as you have identified and folks
39:27
like you who are as they do that pivot calling them out right in their dream
39:34
world I imagine you all become more open to compromise and just let them pivot yeah but that doesn't seem likely not if
39:41
your not if your commitments are first and foremost to the authority of Christ and
39:47
the word of God no we're not going to change because the word of God doesn't change the Christian worldview is consistent in this area the problem we
39:55
have right now politically there's so many people who are just in this as a career and it's just pretend it's just
40:03
something you say for votes and um I don't want to live that way I want to live in such a way that I actually
40:08
believe what I say I believe and um if I say this human being is valuable I act like that's true would you rather Carrie
40:16
Lake and Donald Trump lose with endorsing abortion abolition or win if
40:22
it required stepping away I'd rather see them lose being consistent yeah because I think what God shows us
40:29
over and over and over again is that what He blesses is faithfulness in his people and at times he will change
40:35
history with the smallest numbers of people through faithfulness so yeah
40:41
would it be devastating to this nation to see um more from my perspective
40:47
economic injustices that are promoted by socialists and marxists and things like
40:52
that would it be devastating to have them employ more of their worldview with regard to children and sexuality yeah
41:00
that'd be devastating and I don't want that for our nation but what I do want is to see actual transformation take
41:06
place and if that means that you have to lose an election because you're being faithful and consistent I'd say God will
41:12
bless that M good cool thank you so much I really appreciate it this was help absolutely I really enjoyed talking to
41:19
you you're point about the idolatry of trump is interesting I mean um and I do think the way that a lot of like um
41:25
conservative talk about feels different than any kind of politician relationship I've seen
41:31
yeah it is interesting and the thing that I thought was the most disturbing thing to me is we went during the
41:36
capital breach I wasn't there I didn't do that we were there just on the ground that day to just provide like Christian
41:43
media coverage of like this whole thing and then that whole thing went off we were ways away we did some stuff saying
41:50
this is not the way you do things this is not the way Christians should approach this but the thing that was I think most disturbing to me that whole
41:57
day was the idolatry of trump it was Christians with big signs of like you
42:03
know Jesus hugging Trump or like a trump in Jesus on a cross it was like the most
42:08
disturbing you see it in some of the rallies gross thing imaginable and it was just one sign after another that was
42:15
so offensive like you know so when it comes to Republicans and
42:22
abortion rights there's enough finger pointing to go around people like M grass won
42:28
compromise which is anger pro- life activists like students for life and hardliners like Pastor Jeff Durban are
42:36
upset with both groups for not going far enough this division could represent a
42:42
problem for republicans in November the first presidential election since
42:47
stops because now that row is overturned the anti-abortion movement has lost its
42:52
Chief organizing principle and in doing so created one
42:58
for the [Music]
43:13
Democrats that's the run up for Thursday June 20th 2024 and now the
43:20
rundown the work Jeff Durban is doing in Arizona is just one piece of how religious conservatives are organizing
43:27
to push abortion abolition and other causes in a postro world to understand
43:32
how that work is unfolding nationally and how it might show up in November I
43:38
called a colleague I'm Elizabeth Das I'm the national religion correspondent for the times and I write about the
43:46
anti-abortion movement and especially the Conservative Christian power
43:52
involved in advancing the anti-abortion cause yeah and we recently just spoke to
43:58
Lisa Lair who co-authored a book with you that is titled the fall of row specifically around these issues how
44:05
would you describe the goal of the anti-abortion movement in this post row ER well their ultimate goal is the end
44:13
of all abortion right the fall of row was the beginning in a way not the end
44:18
and it's a movement that thinks in these long arcs right I think in generational terms so even though now there's been
44:26
this enormous backlash to the overturning of row from liberals moderates even some conservatives who
44:33
were not happy with that decision they are looking ahead to what
44:38
are the kind of tactics that they need ultimately to push ahead with their goal so they're finding some success of
44:46
course in conservative pockets and conservative States and among the you
44:53
know True Believers of their cause mhm you know I I know you covered the the religious angle of this you actually
44:58
talked to the pastor that we spoke to in our episode today how is this issue playing out amongst the religious right
45:05
are they aligned on what to do next regarding abortion rights they're splits um the Pastor Jeff
45:13
Durban that you spoke with for your episode he's on what many would consider
45:19
The Fringe of the anti-abortion movement but it's a fringe
45:24
that's been gaining a lot of traction and that's a segment of this whole movement that we
45:31
see doubling down hardening across areas uh of politics public policy efforts
45:40
that really is doubling down with the Conservative Christian Vision uh and
45:47
following it through to its logical conclusion we see that in places like the Southern Baptist convention opposing
45:54
IVF we see it uh with some of the Republican lawmakers who are in the Maga
46:01
movement and the anti-abortion movement where those things kind of mingle together in States uh and places like
46:07
Arizona for example M are there any notable anti-abortion candidates running on further restrictions in this climate
46:14
what are you watching for when it comes to November well it's been really interesting watching Republicans even
46:20
those who have been staunch anti-abortion supporters even former president Trump um who made his whole so
46:27
much of his platform was his support for uh the anti-abortion movement they've
46:32
been really running away from the cause in many ways what was a political advantage to them um before Rowell is
46:40
clearly not right now and I think the politicians often see that especially if they're in moderate districts um
46:47
restrictions on abortion cracking down on IVF these are very unpopular
46:53
positions and Republicans know that thank you so much Elizabeth uh we
46:59
appreciate your time thanks so much for having me
47:04
instead there are 25 days to the Republican National Convention 60 days until the Democratic
47:11
National Convention and 138 days until the general election we'll see you next week
