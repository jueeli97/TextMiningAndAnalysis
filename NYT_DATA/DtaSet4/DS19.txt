Why It Had to Be Trump


0:00
[Music] looking back at the past year at least
0:05
when it comes to the presidential race Democrats and Republicans have had opposite
0:11
challenges Democrats are dealing with the lack of enthusiasm from some voters to reelect President Biden for
0:18
republicans and Donald Trump there's a different problem the base of the Republican Party loves him but everyone
0:26
else is not so sure regardless Trump dominated in the Republican primary and
0:33
on Tuesday night Donald Trump has crossed the threshold the former president has yet again secured the
0:39
Republican Party nomination for the third presidential election cycle in a row he won in Mississippi Hawaii
0:45
Washington in Georgia officially becoming the presumptive Republican
0:51
nominee that's despite the criminal charges the defamation and sexual abuse
0:56
findings the hundreds of millions of dollars and legal penalties the two impeachments the ongoing election denial
1:03
and the continued Fallout from January 6th so considering all this I wanted to
1:10
ask Republicans the same question we posed to Democrats last week and answer it more directly than we ever have
1:17
before how exactly did we end up with Donald Trump again and
1:23
why from The New York Times I'm Esten hearnen this is the runup
1:35
Hi how are you hey ma'am how are you stad I first met Henry Barber last year
1:41
at a Republican National committee's winter meeting in Dana Point California it's uh I get wistful thinking about the
1:48
weather and the location right now yeah we were looking at the Pacific Ocean uh
1:53
not too shabby Barber's been a member of the RNC since 2005 his uncle Haley
1:58
Barber used to be governor of Mississippi and served as RNC chairman in the
2:04
1990s I talked to him Monday morning after what was actually a big week for the RNC Ron McDaniel who served his RNC
2:12
chair for seven years stepped down and the Trump campaign then installed
2:18
several close allies in key positions including Trump's daughter-in-law Laura
2:23
Trump who will now serve as RNC co-chair that's right the Republican
2:28
Party itself is now a trump family business and people like Barber seem to
2:34
be on the outs so I wanted to know as a self-proclaimed party loyalist what he
2:40
thought about these changes and the state of the Republican establishment in general considering back in Dana Point
2:46
when Ron McDaniel was chair there was widespread confidence that this Republican primary would at least be
2:52
competitive you know Rona McDaniel the outgoing RNC chair spoke to RNC members
2:58
on Friday and then that spee she call for party Unity really explicitly kind of like she did last year in Dana Point
3:04
I guess I wanted to start there would you say that the Republican party is United behind Trump and are you yourself
3:10
behind him well I am for him I will say I was uh for Nikki Haley in the primary
3:16
but when you transition from the primary to the general it gets down to it's a one-on-one situation and you make a
3:23
choice and for me I would much prefer a republican in the white house or
3:28
Republican senator Republican house and and just much more aligns with my theory
3:35
and take on you know how the government should act in Washington and around the
3:42
country would you say the party is United behind him um no it's not yet um
3:49
you know we're transitioning as I said before from primary to General and that just takes time and it takes time on the
3:56
Republican side it takes time on the Democrat side as well and you know my counsel to former
4:03
president Trump would be pick up the phone call Nikki Haley call Ronda santis
4:09
and begin to talk to Republican voters who voted for others in the primary and
4:15
let them know that hey you know what I need your help you're welcome you're included and if they don't feel included
4:22
you run the risk of a lot of traditional Republican voters sitting out the
4:28
election or possibly voting for some Third Party politics is about math and
4:34
it's particularly about addition so we need to add not subtract to be able to
4:39
win in November what what was your reasoning for supporting Haley why did you back her well
4:46
honestly I was very interested in us moving beyond former president Trump and
4:51
she was the viable alternative but we're at a point where Republicans do need to
4:58
come together president Trump is our nominee and if we want to win and if we
5:04
want to get the country back on track and ask our friend Joe Biden to move out come next January Republicans have got
5:11
to come together yeah yeah I want talk about that I mean that's really where I want to sit in this conversation is
5:17
about Trump about the prospects of a republican victory in November and the challenges there you know we talked in
5:23
January last year Trump was pretty down after the midterms and I remember you sighting people like Governor DeSantis
5:29
like governor Brian km Mike dwine as people who were pointing a better direction for Republicans to win since
5:35
the Republican primary was so lopsided I'm wondering was Trump more dominant
5:40
than you expected he's more dominant than I wanted him to be look I wanted us to move on and the
5:49
voters decided differently you know what's clear is that Republican voters
5:56
believe Donald Trump he really connects with them it's interesting I think when
6:02
he ran in 16 Trump just really connected with workingclass folks and increasingly
6:10
workingclass minorities and you see that in polling today these are groups of
6:16
people who have traditionally over the last 20 years you know been voting for
6:22
Democrats and all of a sudden there's a material percentage of them who appear
6:28
to be very open to change and it gives a real opportunity for Trump and the
6:36
Republican ticket overall MH in retrospect was Trump inevitable as the
6:42
nominee again in 24 because of that connection that you mentioned that's longstanding and and deeper among the
6:48
base I think that's fair to say instead that he was inevitable and it's interesting I think a bunch of
6:54
prosecutors have overreached in various court cases I was going to ask about
7:00
those coming up yeah yeah and I I just there's no question that when that started happening last spring at that
7:08
point DeSantis was the one with the momentum but all of a sudden Republican
7:14
voters started rallying around the former president and they wanted to defend him and then it became inevitable
7:22
I mean he had the momentum he kept his foot on the gas and nobody ever was able
7:27
to really threaten him uh politically yeah look I I I am a republican who
7:34
disagrees with Donald Trump on a number of things and particularly the postelection action that he took sort of
7:41
stop the steal stuff that you know that I don't buy into uh January 6 all of
7:47
those things had me really positioned as a republican who thought we need to move
7:54
on Beyond this and let's get back to public policy but a lot of my Republican
8:00
Brethren decided no no we're going to fight for this guy Democrats are overreaching and I will say you know
8:07
this New York case where they say he exaggerated the value of various
8:14
properties that they're trying to get $350 million out of him when there is no
8:20
victim as far as I can understand I mean the banks I guess would have been the victims and they all made money it's
8:27
absurd it is so overreaching that it makes even me who disagrees with him on
8:34
January 6 and that kind of thing feel like yeah he's getting the shaft I mean
8:39
maybe if they exaggerated it maybe you find them 5 million bucks or something but 350 million it is absurd so I think
8:47
the prosecutors did him a political favor I guess I'm wondering considering your someone who disagrees with what
8:53
he's talked about in terms of last election being stolen someone who does think that some of the allegations are serious why is that not disqualifying
9:01
for you to be the leader of the party because ultimately I just feel like Joe Biden has failed the country I mean if
9:07
you look at what's happened just on the border it is a just total debacle I
9:12
think if you look at crime and inflation the economy if you look at Afghanistan if you look at even Ukraine where I
9:21
think he's been weak and he seems kind of all over the place with Israel and Gaza he just he's failing I guess I'm
9:28
saying how do you weigh the pros and cons of trump himself leading your party considering for all those Pros that he
9:35
could have against Biden there are some real downsides I mean we were just at CPAC with the kind of trump Grassroots
9:40
base of the party and they are still talking about a stolen election they're still talking about calls to free the
9:47
people who were there and kind of framing them as Martyrs they're still doubting that November will be free and
9:53
fairly decided if Donald Trump doesn't win how do you weigh then the reality of
9:58
the things you like about Donald Trump with the fact that it does seem to come with some things that seems to strike at
10:04
the real core of democratic institutions well as I said I disagree
10:10
with people who say that the election was stolen president Trump sold that story and people bought it but
10:17
ultimately instead for me and I think for a lot of Republicans would they
10:22
rather have a republican Administration that fits better in their view of what
10:28
the government should do on issues like the border and crime the economy and
10:33
what's going on around the world or Joe Biden so it becomes more of a generic
10:38
Republican versus Democrat thing for me personally so I I guess can I try one more time yeah you can keep trying he's
10:44
not a he he's not a generic Republican though he he's not even promising kind of generic Republican policies to your
10:51
point this is someone who's explicitly promising to weaponize the doj to go after political opponents this seems to
10:57
be the exact thing you're deriding the New York da for doing uh here allegedly so I
11:02
guess I'm saying is it fair to call Donald Trump a generic Republican versus
11:08
Joe Biden dere to considering his policies do seem outside of where the Republican Party typically is I'm not
11:15
calling president Trump a generic Republican I'm just saying that's more
11:20
how I view this because I'm looking at the bigger picture of can we have a
11:26
republican in the White House can we have a Republican Senate a Republican house working together and when I
11:32
compare that to Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer it's just sort of a much easier
11:38
decision for me to get there not that there's not baggage that I dislike there
11:44
is but you know my view is if you compare the four years of Donald Trump
11:51
and the results that he got they're just much stronger than what we've gotten
11:56
from Joe Biden and so ultimately that gets me to return to the flock if
12:03
you will as a republican I want to talk about what Trump did with the RNC over the weekend you know you've been a part
12:09
of that organization since 2005 and last week Trump instituted several of his close allies including Michael Watley of
12:15
North Carolina and his daughter-in-law Laura Trump at the top of the RNC one of Trump's campaign advisers Chris levita
12:22
is also expected to take over operations of the place what has it been like to essentially see Trump swoop in
12:29
and consume the institution that you've served in well aad it is normal for the
12:37
Republican nominee to have great influence and even to take over you know
12:42
sort of the day-to-day operations of the RNC once they become the presumptive nominee some of that is the natural
12:49
primary General transition totally and that's all that's happened here honestly
12:54
Michael Watley who is the new RNC chairman was a very successful State
13:00
chairman in North Carolina he look he's won he's won U lots of big races in
13:07
North Carolina so give him credit uh Laura Trump is I think new to all this
13:12
and she's learning but I will say she commands the room I think once she kind
13:18
of gets her uh head around the message and some of the details I think she can
13:24
be an effective spokesperson but I mean no question from day one she can get any rich person just about on the phone and
13:31
make the ask for the RNC and that's a huge advantage that Laura Trump has and
13:37
so I think they have a great opportunity in a political environment that is set up very nicely for Republicans to do
13:44
well in November I mean it did seem like you had some uncomfort with the changes you did try to introduce two resolutions
13:49
at the RNC one that said they should remain neutral throughout the primary uh the other said that uh the RNC would be
13:57
barred from paying Trump's legal bills why did you introduce those and can you tell me the what happened to those
14:02
resolutions sure well the first resolution essentially said look the
14:07
Republican Party by rule has to be neutral in the primary and we put that out there once Nikki Haley dropped out
14:15
of the race that became obsolete the second resolution really emphasized that
14:21
the RNC has one job and that one job is winning elections and that means the RNC
14:27
should spend its resources own winning elections not paying any candidates
14:32
legal bills including former president Trump's so it was a pretty straightforward deal it was just we were
14:40
trying to protect the institution and the rules and the mission of the RNC but that wasn't successful the second one
14:46
either right neither were successful and instead I knew when we presented these
14:51
that they weren't going to be successful but what we had was a really robust conversation in
14:58
particularly about the fact that RNC dollars should be spent on winning elections and not paying legal bills and
15:05
that's really important because we have a lot of money to raise and donors need to be confident that their donations
15:12
will be spent on winning elections and not legal bills if I remember correctly I mean they've said mixed things on this
15:18
subject L Trump and others have said that they think the Republican elector will be okay if RNC and others pay
15:25
Donald Trump's legal bills and and I think that's where she's learning and the Trump campaign clean that up you
15:32
know it seems as if the Republican establishment if we use those words that they though Trump can't pay lights to
15:38
has been uncomfortable with some of the ways the Bas has pushed them in new directions but has largely gone along with it I know that the the goal is
15:44
winning and the goal is implementing policy and so that's one of the reasons to go along with it but one question I
15:50
have is like does that have a limit and do you worry about something like the six happening again there's no
15:55
indication that folks who were you know lead voices of that are show Contrition
16:01
I mean is there any fear you have that the path that you're laying can bring us back to something that was even as you
16:09
describe it you know really uncomfortable and really kind of
16:15
anti-democratic no I mean look um no no not really no okay um but
16:23
I guess why not you maybe you know something I don't well well I'm hopeful that we're
16:30
not going to make that mistake again but look the country is very divided and we do need to come together so in the
16:36
primary there's all this infighting we' got to get beyond that and president Trump's got to be the leader there he's
16:44
got to be the one that sets the tone and he needs to say to people who didn't vote for him I need your help can you be
16:50
part of my team and then he reaches out to the suburbanite voters and then to even traditional Democrat voters who
16:57
were very open to change sound like a different person though than the person we both know right I can't it's hard for
17:02
me to imagine Donald Trump reaching out to Democrats I'm just telling you how to win okay last question is like what
17:09
motivates you like what are you fighting for like the Donald Trump has upended the party has kind of made it more
17:14
difficult for your like Lane to exist in the ways that it has in previous years he's now kind of you know installed
17:21
loyalists at the RNC some of which is tradition some of which is outside of it so I'm guess I'm asking like what keeps
17:28
you so loyal to a Republican party that has changed for I think you know the
17:33
values that may have made you more loyal to it in the past and is there any version of the party that it wouldn't be
17:41
worth it to win where winning wouldn't be the only goal and you would say you know what this candidate I can't back
17:48
and maybe you don't back Biden or something else but I guess I'm wondering is there a limit to
17:54
winning well I'm an American before I'm a Republican and so if I don't feel like
18:01
a republican Administration can do uh right by America at some point I'm going to you
18:08
know look for another option but you know sitting here today it's an easy decision for me it's easy it's actually
18:14
an easy call for you it yeah I mean ultimately it's easy
18:20
but that doesn't mean instead that there aren't things that give me great pause
18:26
but again it comes down to this one-on-one decision and I think lots of Republicans
18:32
are going to have to think about that and think about the direction of the country and as the country can be better off under Republican Administration or
18:40
Joe Biden's you know failed Administration thank you I really appreciate your time thank you for
18:46
talking to us again all right dead always good to be with you [Music]
18:51
man just hours after we spoke Trump's team tightened their grip on the RNC
18:57
dozens of staffers getting laid off just days after Donald Trump's handpick team took over the organization top officials
19:03
firing more than 60 employees including the heads of major departments like data and Communications it's a blood bath
19:10
there's wide layoffs and they really uh go farther I think than many people at
19:16
the RNC were expected were told we got back in touch with Henry Barber to see
19:21
what he thought and to my surprise he downplayed the news and liken the changes the Trump team made to similar
19:28
changes that happened in previous presidential Cycles meanwhile Trump supporters cheer
19:34
at the layoffs this is excellent said right-wing personality Charlie Kirk the
19:40
antitrump sleeper cells all have to go we'll be right
19:52
back here's the thing Henry Barber helps explain how Trump became the Republican
19:58
nominee again but he doesn't quite explain why it happened Barber is your
20:03
classic Republican not a trump Republican while he's clearly willing to support Trump as his party's nominee
20:11
he's not particularly thrilled by it but frankly Barber is in the
20:17
minority so I wanted to talk with someone who represents the ascended Wing in the Republican Party the Maga
20:27
wing hey hello can you hear me hey guys yep
20:32
can you hear me yeah thank you so much for joining us we appreciate your time thank you very much remind me what we're talking about again yeah no problem
20:39
we're really talking about how and why Trump became the nominee so we're really looking at the state of the Republican
20:44
party and then looking ahead to November got it V ramaswami ran the presidential campaign that was closest to Donald
20:50
Trump in terms of ideology and style I did take inspiration from president
20:55
Trump's victory in 2016 just from the standpoint of being an outsider he's molded himself after Trump and says the
21:02
former president is part of the reason he got into politics in the first place right I think that hadn't been done that
21:08
somebody who had purely been a leader in business said you know what I'm going to bring that executive talent to Leading
21:14
this country and so if he hadn't done it just by way of biography in 2016 I don't think I would have thought
21:21
of doing it in the year 2023 on the debate stage when Trump
21:26
refused to attend ramaswami often played the role of lead Maga voice mimicking
21:31
Trump's tendency to belittle his political opponents mocking the Republican establishment and the press
21:38
and spewing unfounded conspiracies like January 6 was an inside job but that's
21:44
the exact reason I wanted to talk to him someone whose Journey mirrors that of many Trump supporters so as people like
21:51
Henry Barber seem to be losing influence what does one of the new faces of the party say to the central question of
21:57
this episode why Trump again the day I dropped out you know uh that Journey the reason I'm
22:04
asking you about it is because it feels really reflective a lot of the Republican voters we talked to you know specifically the kind of trump side
22:09
that's gotten more invested and involved in the party since he came on in 2016 and I've heard them describe this kind
22:15
of movement as a Maga as a Grassroots takeover frankly of the party I I guess I would wonder do you agree with that FR
22:23
me I think it is a yes is the answer to that question and I think it's more than just a Grassroots takeover because that
22:30
implies it's some sort of tug-of-war battle I think it is filling a void of what the Republican Party actually means
22:36
or what it actually stands for I think the Republican party has historically defined itself in opposition to the
22:43
agenda of Democrats and the way I would summarize what I believe America First
22:48
stands for is a few basic propositions one is the people who we elect to run
22:54
the government should be the ones who actually run the government not third party actors in The what we call the
23:01
Deep State unelected bureaucrats that's number one number two those elected leaders and those public officials owe
23:08
their sole moral duty to the citizens of this country not another one it would go
23:13
straight down the list from there public service should be about serving the public not actually serving he kept going with this list for a while but I
23:20
wanted to get to our main question um you know we are doing this question in response to what we get from voters
23:25
often which is why did we get these two candidates and so we did it one for the Democrats we are coming to you partially
23:31
as someone who's been on the trail who's talked to a lot of the Republican electorate in your view of kind of up close look at the Republican electorate
23:38
why do you think they came back to Donald Trump in 24 so I think that what I'm about to say is true for the
23:44
Republicans in a way that I don't believe is true for the Democrats this time around this is unambiguously who
23:50
the people of this party wanted to represent them and I say that because there was a richly contested Ed process
23:59
and so that I think is at least a high conviction result of a process now why are we there look I think that they
24:07
decided that they wanted to go with who was tried and true right you will have
24:12
had four years of Biden you had four years of trump here's what happened under Trump here's what happened under Biden and I'm going with what I know in
24:20
terms of that contrast so looking back in that view do you think Trump was inevitable as a nominee like was it
24:25
always going to end up this way Yes actually looking back I think the
24:31
answer is yes obviously if I had believed that at the outset then I wouldn't have run but with the benefit
24:36
of hindsight and having been through that process I do think it was inevitable because he had something that nobody else did rightly so he had served
24:44
as US president and in my opinion and in the opinion of the Republican electorate done so successfully and if you're
24:50
looking at the track record now I'm coming at this maybe with a different view than many others who are listening to this to look at those side by side
24:56
it's a pretty compelling case to say that under Trump here's the situation at the border we did not have nearly as many illegal border crossings as we do
25:02
under President Biden under Trump we did not have the level of inflation that we do under President Biden under Trump we
25:08
were not under the on the cusp of major conflict in multiple parts of the world as we are under President Biden so if
25:14
you want a secure border if you want a growing economy if you want national pride in this country and if you want to
25:19
stay out of World War II vote Trump that's a clear case and so having had
25:25
somebody who was already a president with that track record run running against a president who has a different
25:31
track record I do think functionally it was inevitable that Trump was going to be the nominee and frankly even though
25:36
that I've dropped out now that's a big part of why he has my full support you know the other reason we're kind of
25:41
pushing on this question is partially because I do think for a lot of people there was a sense that Trump was a
25:47
politically wounded figure after 2020 which made the prospect of him coming back harder to believe I had actually
25:52
seen the statement I think from you that characterized that as part of the reason you were in the race was because of a feeling that Trump had political
25:59
problems I think the people really tight that to the legal issues that have transitioned from now to then obviously Trump faces 91 felony counts he's been
26:06
ordered to pay more than $500 million in various penalties why don't you think the indictments or the legal shift in
26:13
Trump situation was disqualifying for Republican voters because in the prism of people who don't spend that much time
26:18
with them I think there was an assumption that they would be so the answer to that is clear it is that these
26:25
indictments are politicized lawfare the fact that you have seen some of that law fair even play out extrajudicially
26:32
the fact that it took a 90 Supreme Court rebuke to otherwise sty and effect to
26:38
keep him off the ballot reveals I think to the American public and especially the rep Republican primary electorate
26:45
that you do have forces in this country that will stop at nothing to keep this man away from office but the more of
26:52
that lawfare we saw I think the more convinced the Republican electorate became that having somebody who has
26:59
already been there already faced up against a lot of the threats that are coming back for him is the best bet that
27:04
we have to defeat them and so if these were indictments that I think were grounded in real black and white blackl
27:13
law the response would be different than what you see right now where everybody knows that the Alvin brag case or the
27:20
fanny Willis Case or the Leticia James case there's no way they would have brought these cases if Donald Trump were
27:26
not a political figure right for office yeah I hear that and I hear a lot of trump supporters kind of explain that to
27:31
me they specifically mentioned the cases you're talking about but in the same way there's an intuitive understanding of maybe the flimsiness of those we've also
27:38
talked to people have an intuitive understanding of the seriousness of the January 6 case even if that trial hasn't
27:44
gone forward why is not the facts of someone being alleged to have conspired
27:49
to overturn an election a disqualifying act for a republican nominee so the
27:54
first thing I will say is I disagree with you on the merits there but we don't have delve into that though we can
27:59
let's just pause on the premise that cuz I've been in conversations like this one with folks like yourself who
28:06
correctly recognize or at least implicitly recognize the politicization of Criminal
28:13
prosecutions by multiple different prosecutors multiple different guess I'm
28:18
not trying to fight you on those merits I was just trying to put that to the side so I'm not actually agreeing with you about those things I'm just putting it to the side but I would say that at
28:25
any moment where you have a US presidential candidate and former US president and a front runner running for
28:30
office and you have an Alvin brag case a Leticia James case a fanny Willis Case
28:35
and multiple Statewide efforts to remove somebody from a ballot something that has never happened in a US presidential
28:41
election yes that does have a profound effect on voters to wake up and say this
28:47
is not the system working as it should that this is a system that is trying to prevent me from voting for someone who I
28:54
otherwise might want to vote for now I definitely want to vote for you know we had the Secretary of State
28:59
in Maine on the show and I asked her these similar questions right I asked about the likelihood that the Supreme Court would overturn or the impression
29:06
that it could give that Democrats were acting in a politically motivated way against the eventual Republican nominee
29:11
and their response to me was that in the same way that this is unprecedent so were the actions that Donald Trump took
29:17
after the 2020 election I guess I still don't hear a response to the question I'm asking which is that what that
29:22
decision belongs to the voters is what I would say that decision belongs to the voters okay that I think is the Bedrock
29:28
principle that our country is founded on is that the voters get to decide who
29:33
actually governs and so the idea that one individual just waking up and deciding by single action of one
29:40
individual by Fiat removing one of two major presidential candidates from a ballot defies the idea that we the
29:47
people can choose who to vote for I want to try one more time to be more specific sure outside of the question of removal
29:53
from the ballot which I heard an answer to that you believe it should be up to the voters why is Trump's action after the last presidential election
30:00
which are alleged to have disrupted the transition of power and for many
30:05
Americans agree with that why is that not a disqualifying act just as someone leading your party yeah so first of all
30:12
I I disagree with the characterization itself right I think that and this gets into the merits of it but Trump
30:18
specifically to spoke about peaceful action that day on January 6th
30:23
exercising one's First Amendment rights not in one instance has Trump been charged convicted or even prosecuted on
30:31
the basis that he incited an Insurrection let's not forget that they don't even have the gall to charge him
30:36
of that yet without going through the courts have the gall to try to remove him from a ballot that is a far greater
30:44
offense than what many voters who may have even disagreed with some of Trump's actions on January 6th to say that they
30:49
would have handled it in a different way that's overridden by the government overreach in trying to keep a man off
30:57
char right now there's there's literally zero and this gets into legal detail here and
31:03
we can do that saying conspiracy to obstruct official proceeding conspiracy to defr the United States I mean I'm saying why are those charges not serious
31:09
enough why weren't the action serious enough I guess that's all I'm asking I guess I still don't feel like either answer leave it to the people is is the
31:14
answer of the Republican electorate is that give me the chance to actually judge who I want to be the president and
31:20
all things considered I get to vote for who I think will be that best president you know it's also more than charges
31:26
though the last case I wanted to ask about was their findings in New York civil court where Trump was found liable
31:31
of sexual abuse and defamation why does that as a kind of personal character statement not disqualify him for being
31:38
the nominee in your eyes so I'm just want to understand exactly what the
31:43
objective is in this conversation is it to understand how Trump is the nominee are you asking me for why I support
31:50
Trump or are you asking me for who I'm going to vote for it's both and I think for a lot of Voters are going through
31:55
the same calculations that you are I'm asking you as a proxy for a republican electorate okay so I'll tell you one
32:01
thing is one is like many of the Republican primary electorate I reject the idea that that case was itself
32:09
brought for any reason other than the fact that it was an opportunist seizing on the fact that Trump was a prominent
32:14
person running for president now I ran for president because I had a vision for this country and believed that it was
32:20
going to take a new generation of leadership to reach the next Generation so you're asking somebody who set out to
32:25
run for US president because I believed at the time I ran that I'd be the best person for the job but as I look as a
32:30
voter of who's going to be the best president to lead this country forward I think we have a unique opportunity that
32:36
we've never had in our National History which is to look at four years of trump
32:41
and four years of Biden and if you want to choose between the four years of trump and the four years of Biden to
32:46
look at those four years and say what had happened with the economy what happened with the Border what happened
32:52
with our standing on the global stage under Trump we had a sealed border largely we had a growing economy and we
32:58
had a president who did inspire a significant part of this country to be proud of who we are that's why I would support Trump and I think that's why so
33:05
many in the Republican electorate support Trump is it a political problem though that we still hear versions of
33:11
Trump's message that are completely kind of outside of I think majority views specifically when it comes to the last
33:17
election being stolen or not stolen right but specifically when it comes to you know an attack on institutions that
33:24
remains unpopular does Donald Trump have to change his message to actualize the kind of opportunity that you're talking
33:30
about look I think that if you listen to Trump's message particularly in recent weeks success will be our Vengeance that
33:38
has been his message I think it's a unifying message I think success is unifying and so the more we're talking
33:44
about National Unity right Biden ran on a message of uniting this country well
33:49
ultimately the buck stops with the president we're not a United Country right now but I think we can be and I don't think we're far so far away from
33:56
it as it might seem if you turn on cable news or social media I think most people
34:02
in this country do share the same National values in common it's one of the things I learned from the presidential campaign I went to places
34:09
from the south side of Chicago to Kensington in the inner city of Philadelphia I learned a lot from the experience which is that people there
34:16
are every bit as frustrated about the southern border crisis and this is seven months ago as they are right now in the
34:22
Republican primary electorate and so no I don't think we're going to win this election by adjudicating Tech technicalities of the past I think we're
34:29
going to win this election by painting an alternative vision of the future to the one that we're actually getting from
34:35
the president who already in office back stopped by a track record for four years of staying out of Foreign Wars and
34:40
growing this economy and securing our national borders and our national identity we only have a couple more questions and I appreciate you playing
34:46
ball with us given how TR critical Trump was of Nikki Haley during the campaign going Beyond kind of political insults
34:52
but seemingly personal insults he's called her bird brain and things like that is is a political problem the way
34:58
Donald Trump talks about his political opponents within the Republican party or something that he should change before
35:04
November I don't because I think that there's a fundamental misunderstanding that a lot of the press Corps has of
35:10
trump that Ordinary People in the audience of the American electorate understand far better it's that Donald
35:17
Trump talks to you like a real human being has a conversation in their private life right much of the things
35:23
that he said in his speeches are said in a tongue-and-cheek way are said in a way that is design to engage and build the
35:29
kind of trust that human beings friends have with each other and the jokes they tell people trust somebody who's willing
35:35
to talk openly without a filter occasionally May overstep some type of bound of some Gentile Norm that's set
35:43
and I think the sensationalization of that is a much bigger problem than the actual statement in the context of
35:50
cander that it's offered do you talk to Trump these days do you have any or plan to have any formal role with the
35:55
campaign I talk to Trump from time to time frequently we been on the campaign Trail together I've never been someone
36:02
who's known to keep my thoughts to myself it's not something I do particularly well and so he and I have
36:07
we have a great relationship I mean I uh often share with him my opinions especially in areas where I think that
36:13
there are things that need to be said that others may not have said already and you know I found him to be somebody
36:19
who's actually really different than the media portrayal of him for the better in that respect where he is a better
36:25
listener Than You Yes Yes actually that he's actually really interested in
36:30
Converse or contrarian opinions I think he actually is interested at least in my experience with him in being challenged
36:37
and having a good dialogue that gets to the right answer I think it's a mark of a true leader who's somebody who's able
36:43
to with humility acknowledge there are certain issues that he may not yet know about wants the best ideas he can
36:48
possibly find contrarian views when necessary and then arrive at a decisive
36:54
policy position on the back of that we the people create a government that is accountable to us not the other way
37:02
around and I do think that Donald Trump embodies that better than any politician probably in modern American history to
37:07
say that I am responsive to you the people and so to the people who will look at that and caricature that and say
37:13
oh he's a populist I mean that's a word that many people use in a negative context I call it responsive to the
37:19
people who are your actual boss the actual boss of the US president is the people of this country not some party
37:26
apparatus not some Mega donor class it's we the people and so to have a president
37:31
is he responsive to people broadly or is he responsive to Republican base I think he has grown the Republican base I think
37:37
he's responsive to people broadly I think he cares about this country and look everyone's not going to agree on
37:42
everything I think this should be the heart of our message you don't have to agree with 100% of what I say to support
37:48
me you don't have to agree with 100% of what we say to support us that should go without saying but it's worth saying
37:55
that you can speak your mind even if we really disagree with you you still have the right to say it because that's
38:01
America and so yes I think that that's a big part of why Donald Trump has been successful and more importantly I hope
38:08
why he will be in a position to dare I say it unite this country in a way that
38:13
Biden promised to but just didn't actually accomplish and that's what I'm rooting for more than anything else is a reuniting of this nation you know you
38:21
actually zoom in on a a line from Trump you said success will be our fance I I I remember when we were in South Carolina
38:27
you know I am your retribution as like the line that really kind of stuck out in that Trump message who is the one
38:34
inspiring the retribution who who's the Vengeance against I think the vengeance is against that unelected class that
38:41
managerial class the class that is exercising political power that nobody delegated to them in my parli it's what
38:49
you call the administrative state right the Deep State well yeah I mean I think yes that's is what we call the Deep
38:54
State now I know that that's a term that is caric assured by many on the left as
39:00
some sort of kooky right-wing conspiracy theory which is why I prefer to talk about it as what it is which is
39:05
something that actually used to be every bit of left-wing concern as it is a right-wing concern today which is a bureaucratic technocratic exploitation
39:13
of political power without the back stop of political accountability it's old
39:18
world monarchy I mean that's really what the old world was all about it was skeptical that we the people could be
39:23
trusted to self-govern but that's what makes America great actually is that we decide for ourselves not somebody from
39:30
on high telling us that's the heart of what this movement is
39:39
about thank you so much I really appreciate your time I appreciate it
39:44
man after 2 weeks of talking with insiders from both parties I have a clear answer to our
39:51
question how do we get these two candidates again well how could we not
39:57
consider ing Trump's grip on the GOP base and Biden's grip on the Democratic
40:02
establishment a rematch of 2020 may not be what voters prefer but it is what
40:08
they're going to get the same candidates each with what turns out to be a
40:13
surprisingly similar core message one that urges the country to unite against the common
40:20
enemy for Biden that enemy is Donald Trump and the Maga Republicans he says
40:27
are threat to the country and to progress for Trump the enemy is not just
40:34
the Democrats but an entire political system he's promising to up
40:42
