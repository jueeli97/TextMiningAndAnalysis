What Women Voters Really Want



0:03
almost 20 years ago two political pollers published a book that sounded like a romantic comedy what women really
0:11
want it was written by kellyan Conway a Republican and celinda Lake a Democrat
0:18
and it had a simple premise that political parties needed to take seriously the particular concerns
0:25
of women who make up more than 50% of the electorate and were poised to be come the country's dominant voting block
0:32
part of taking them seriously they argued was recognizing that Women Voters value Integrity much more than male
0:40
voters but this week as a jury in Manhattan deliberates about whether Donald Trump engaged in a criminal
0:47
scheme to silence and adopt film stars account of a sexual encounter that he feared would cost him the 2016 election
0:55
I found myself wanting to return to the authors of that book and to its assumption
1:01
because a lot has changed since 2005 for instance news of Trump's
1:06
conduct with women like the Access Hollywood tape did not cost him the election in fact he outperformed with
1:14
white women also roow was overturned and in the years since they
1:20
teamed up to write that book kellyanne Conway and Sinda Lake have become leading figures within their respective
1:27
political parties Conway played play a major role in getting Trump elected in
1:32
2016 and Lake was one of Biden's lead pollers in 2020 so this week I wanted to bring Lake
1:40
and Conway back together for an updated book talk of sorts and ask has their understanding of
1:47
female voters changed since 2005 and do they still agree on what women really
1:54
want in 2024 from The New York Times I'm estad hearnen
2:01
this is the run [Music]
2:06
up um can you both introduce yourselves and we'll start with selinda I'm celinda Lake I'm a democratic pollster working
2:13
on the Biden team and worked on the Biden team in 2020 and uh I had the great privilege
2:19
and fun of writing a book with kellyanne Conway on what women really want and I'm
2:25
kellyanne Conway Republican pollster head of Ka cons Consulting LLC my
2:31
longtime friend and colleague blinda Lake and I wrote a book in 2005 called
2:36
what women really want hoping men would think it was a book about sex and run out and buy it and be super
2:42
disappointed two two female posters talking about different kind of figures
2:47
yeah I guess I wanted the origin story kellyan can you tell me how this came together and what you were trying to
2:53
accomplish fenda and I knew each other in an industry polling which at the time
3:00
and I think even still has relatively few women but we kept running into each other on the set of television or in
3:08
speeches that we were asked to give and we found that we clicked personally I
3:14
always like to say I hope that selinda succeeds wildly and everything she works on doesn't um and but she is also in
3:21
terms of women in my life has always been uh complaining less and working harder than most of the rest of us and
3:29
so I've always respected her work and the idea for a book came to be because
3:34
we found ourselves discussing data affecting women and being affected by
3:39
women particularly in the political Arena again and again and of course we
3:45
can agree on the data we just disagree on the strategy about how to message it or how
3:50
to compel different voter cohorts to support in my case the Republican party
3:56
and eventually Donald Trump in 2016 in fela's case of course the Democratic Party and the many candidates that she has worked for I think most recently and
4:03
most robustly President Biden I think he President Biden W in large part in 2020
4:09
because of celinda's advice and the decades that brought her to do that um last point I'll make on this I think
4:15
Sinda and I are seen as political posters but I think our gift is really that we're cultural anthropologists we
4:21
look at women not just through the prism of politics but we look at women through the prison that they look at their own
4:26
lives and so people wake up in the morning they may say I'm worried about money or security everyday affordability
4:34
maybe a rise in crime they don't wake up and say I'm a Republican or a Democrat I'm a liberal or I'm a conservative
4:40
necessarily so it's our job to sort of reflect what they're telling us and
4:45
bring that to the policy makers and the political candidates as well I mean selinda can you put that can help me put
4:51
the book in the context of 2005 when you all were coming together to write this
4:57
and on this topic how unique was that and and what was the motivating factor for you um to get
5:04
involved uh it was very unique and uh I mean first of all again as kellyanne
5:10
said there weren't that many women in their field who owned their own companies both of us had started and owned our own companies and um everybody
5:17
wanted to us to write a book and it was it prefaced where the Future Has Gone with the media everybody wanted to write
5:24
a book on disagreements and we said no no no this is a book about agree
5:29
agreements uh any three women in America can agree on more than Congress does even then and it's certainly true now
5:37
and uh we found that the agreements far outnumbered the disagreements and
5:43
unfortunately what we've seen is women's voices and women's agreements have been
5:48
more polarized and our politics has become a lot more polarized and I think women in particular today yearn for the
5:56
time when people could work together to get things done and try to find compromises and solutions yeah yeah well
6:03
before we get to kind of the substance of the book I just wanted to ask like you know obviously politics has changed a lot since 2005 I hear that you all
6:09
maintain that mutual respect have you all kept in contact since then since the book we have and uh thanks to kellyanne
6:16
we've been on Fox together and done some other things uh so we have and not as
6:23
much as I would have liked so I this was a great opportunity awesome I'm glad to bring it together I mean I would love to
6:29
go through what you all just took as generally as things from the book that you think really stick through to now it
6:35
it seems at the time that women were more I think pigeon hold into what we call the she cluster of issues social
6:41
issues like Social Security or other social issues Health Care education all incredibly congenitally perennially
6:48
important to America's women and sometimes not talked about in the polls where everybody now is discussing
6:54
inflation economy border and immigration and some foreign policy but men were as
6:59
the weak cluster of issues war and economy and I think we broke through that by saying well guess what women are
7:05
not single issue thinkers they're not single issue voters um fast forward to 2024 I see abortion as a vote motivator
7:13
and turnout intensifier for the Democrats this time but it's also one of the only issues if not in some of the
7:18
Swing State polling including the New York Times swing State polling it is the only issue where President Biden has a
7:24
significant advantage over president Trump and Democrats have an advantage over Republicans right now down ballot
7:30
and what we found in the book and we know from all of our work before and since that if we're narrowcasting to any
7:37
group particularly women who are naturally multitaskers where multi-issue thinkers multi-issue voters there's a
7:43
risk in any one party doing that there was a risk for the Republicans in 2022 not finishing their sentences saying
7:50
inflation crime Putin Ukraine Biden comma border those aren't sentences
7:56
they're barely words and so you have to finish your sentence says we know women can take it that not only will they
8:02
accept it but they expect full-blown solutions they already know what the problems are they want Solutions not
8:08
these shopworn sound bites and I will say this we have about 10 million more voters that are female than male so
8:15
women literally decide who our presidents are and people may say Well then why are they voting for Donald
8:21
Trump why are they picking Republicans for any number of reasons I think what's different in 2024 that we could not have
8:26
predicted in 2005 is that younger voters and younger female voters and younger
8:32
voters of color are right now fraying away from in in everybody's polling including the New York Times poll uh
8:39
they're they're migrating away a little bit from Joe Biden and KLA Harris and that's really the wild card to me will
8:45
they stick with Donald Trump where they're giving him higher poll numbers now will they return home to Joe Biden
8:51
or will they stay home at all and I'm a big de Democratic participatory kind of
8:56
gal but I am detecting from some of these voters that the question for them is not for whom to vote or the threshold
9:03
question is whether to bother at all and years ago I know selinda and I GRE up and I think she'd probably agree that
9:09
when we were growing up the idea that you would not vote the idea that a woman would not vote when we just got the right in 1920 the idea that we wouldn't
9:16
vote would have been a little bit shameful and embarrassing I think to say and now people use it as a point of
9:22
Pride why would I encourage them but you see surprise issues like the handling of
9:28
Israel Hamas Gaza Etc creeping up on the Democratic party particularly among younger people you see voters of color
9:35
migrating toward Donald Trump and these head toad ballots mainly based on the economy and border security so all of
9:41
these are wild cards that simply didn't exist in 2005 you know I will pose a similar question I was gonna basically
9:47
pose the same question to you so go jump in thank you uh I think there are uh three things that really stand out to me
9:53
from the book that carried forward one is in the book we really emphasized that
9:59
women were focused on kitchen table economics they were very focused on what affected their families and we really
10:06
see that on steroids in 2024 and I think it's been hard for the
10:12
Democrats to Grapple with that the aggregate statistics the GDP may look
10:18
good but women who go to the grocery store on average three times a week see the price of eggs and milk and have
10:24
Cardiac Arrest prices have gone up 25% in on food since since 2019 and
10:30
women really notice it so the focus of women on everyday economics kitchen
10:36
table economics how issues affect them and their families was something that
10:41
really was emerging in 2004 and is really true on steroids right now and
10:47
makes the vote of women uncertain the second thing we emphasized in the book was that women are not
10:55
monolithic there is a gender gap in every group of women but but women are
11:00
not monolithic and uh we have lost white women even though we've lost them by less than white men as Democrats and it
11:08
is women of color and younger women as kellyanne was saying that have really uh
11:13
produced the margins of Victory and the formula for Democratic victories in almost every close race is to win women
11:21
by more than you lose men and that's the real Battleground wait can you underscore that last Point you're saying
11:27
for Democrats the numeric goal the Electoral goal is to win women by more than they lose men that's right you're
11:34
going to lose men and you can't lose men by too much or women can't make up for it but under kellyanne's leadership
11:40
honestly and in the 2016 Trump campaign was triumphant in this the Republican
11:45
party has gotten a lot better at targeting Women Voters uh than they were before and I think that's something that
11:52
has caught Democrats a little flat-footed and then the last thing the book showed was that women had the
11:59
capacity to worry about lots of things at once and kellyanne was referring to this and it's really funny because we
12:06
asked in another study that we did on women's leadership does multitasking make you a leader and the voters said no
12:13
multitasking makes you a woman it doesn't make you a leader necessarily
12:19
and women have the capacity to worry about lots of things at once and they are definitely doing that and that's
12:24
hard for politicians and I think both of us have emphasized that to our respective part
12:29
I get asked the question all the time are women going to get tired of the abortion issue and it's like not unless
12:36
people get tired of sex I don't think people are going to get tired of the abortion issue but people have the
12:41
ability to be worried about kitchen table economics and the abortion issue as well one of the most telling
12:48
questions for the 2024 election is we find that we have a serious deficit as
12:54
Democrats on the economy but when we ask who will be better for the economic
13:00
well-being of you and your family those numbers are are tied and it's Women
13:06
Voters that switch from the aggregate economy to the micro economy so a very
13:12
very important lesson there for Democrats I I I want to go back to kellyan specifically on something that
13:17
you just said that you think that partially due to her advocacy Republicans have gotten better at
13:22
targeting women can you take us through the specifics of like what you have pushed either Trump campaign in 2016 or
13:28
the party broadly to do that improves that targeting no and I appreciate her
13:33
saying that look let's go back to 2016 I felt like with President Obama
13:40
his gender gap was so significant as well over Mitt Romney for example that
13:45
and certainly John McCain that I thought well maybe women are looking for Outsiders you know we are a majority of
13:52
the voters but we are nowhere close to being a majority of the candidates office holders and donors in politics
13:58
and so in this political system we still feel many many women feel that they are
14:03
on the outside of the glass with their nose pressed against it looking in saying well what's in it for me but what
14:08
I said to Mr Trump at the time was you don't need to win a majority of women
14:13
you just need to do less poorly than other Republican candidates have and you
14:19
need to run up the totals among men and he was seen as an outsider not unlike
14:25
the way Senator Obama was seen as an outsider and both times the Hillary Clinton's Insider status the the the
14:31
irony is the woman the first woman who would have made history was seen as The Insider so that was important the other
14:38
thing is you have to be consistent with women we are great barometers and not thermometers of inconsistency of
14:44
hypocrisy of a lack of genuiness and whether you like it or not many women in this country saw Donald Trump as
14:51
authentic to himself and as consistent on the issues so we were very
14:56
intentional and we also were trying to reach into not just non- colge educated
15:02
women and white women so to speak or Evangelical women those were all very important but to also reach out and try
15:07
to close the gap a little bit among other women college educated women women
15:12
in the suburbs urban women I told president Trump from the beginning you're not going to win them but you
15:19
also should not feed them and and the other thing even when President Trump is saying you know he's talking to
15:25
different people about his vice presidential pick and he and he alone will make that choice I mean make that very clear but does he quote need a
15:31
woman that's a terrible way of looking at it if he feels that a woman who's
15:37
qualified happens to help him win help him govern and would be W on day one terrific but if you think Joe Biden is
15:44
UN poopular in these polls take a look at KLA Harris's numbers and I think we're paying the cost and consequence sadly every day of Joe Biden choosing
15:51
her I think she hasn't found her footing in any major portfolio issue perhaps abortion at last and and that's really I
15:58
think that's costing the Democratic party because they probably thought they could lean on the first female vice
16:03
president of color to help them Shore up the deficits among some women and voters
16:09
of color and young people particularly and need to win those back and I I want to come back to some of that
16:15
particularly your characterization about Trump and his consistency but I would love to get celinda to respond to the
16:20
characterization about Hillary in 2016 what lessons did you take from that election that may have updated what you
16:26
were kind of understanding about the electorate and specifically women from 2005 I would want to start there and
16:32
have some follow-ups after yeah and I also want to follow up on vice president har yeah that's where I was going after
16:38
that okay uh let me start with that uh because I think she's been a huge asset to the ticket vice president is the
16:45
worst role out there other than maybe first lady and we have a stellar one of both but the images of presidents and
16:52
vice presidents merge together in most cases and vice president Harris has been
16:58
a big asset actually with younger voters huge asset on the abortion issue huge
17:04
asset on the student loan issue and I think it took a while for the administration to understand how to
17:10
utilize her they had had as a model in their head the Obama Biden presidency
17:16
and that was one of the most spectacular teams we've ever had in history that really worked together really respected
17:22
each other really complimented each other but in general the VP doesn't have an independent image of the president
17:29
that's true for Republicans Or democrats but I think that uh vice president Harris has been a huge asset in
17:36
articulating as Kellan said the strongest issue for us out there which is the abortion issue but the question
17:43
that I think that she brought up about representation and the idea that choosing someone uh would inherently
17:49
help in these groups I mean I do remember some Democrats in 2020 kind of positioning her as someone who could
17:57
exist outside of the president's individ ual identity was that what about that piece because it doesn't seem as she's
18:02
if she's broken out of that well I would say two things about that first of all vice presidents usually create
18:09
enthusiasm when they're first nominated and she unquestionably did that it's hard to remember back to then yeah but
18:16
she really mobilized young people she really mobilized women of color she created enthusiasm in the base so she
18:25
was very successful in that very much in the way that Vice president Pence
18:30
increased or sealed the deal for Trump with Evangelical Christians and I think it was a very very smart pick and I
18:37
credit kellyanne with that choice from what I read the second thing I would say
18:42
though is I do think the vice presidents are going to be different this year and I think it's a new terrain for both
18:49
parties voters frankly and God willing not this doesn't happen no matter who's nominated but voters are not convinced
18:57
that either Trump or Biden will last four years so they are paying more attention to the vice presidential pick
19:04
than they have in the past so I think everyone is struggling with what is the
19:09
role of Vice President I think you see Donald Trump struggling with who's the best pick because it is a little bit
19:16
different this time than before one of the things I will say about lessons from
19:21
the Hillary campaign yep and uh I think kellyanne had some really astute
19:27
analysis of that I think uh Hillary paid some price for being perceived as an Insider on the one hand
19:33
people always say I'll vote for a woman if she's qualified people never say I'll vote for a man if he's qualified and
19:40
since they've been doing such a bang up job we can understand why nobody questions their qualification I'm being factious of
19:47
course I got you uh but I think that you know on the one hand we needed a really qualified nominee and I think what was
19:53
depressing for a lot of democratic women was we'll never have a woman as qualified as Hillary Clinton was for
19:58
president but that did make her less of a change agent but it was also two
20:04
things that were challenging one was women don't just vote for a woman whether it's a vice president or a
20:10
Presidential nominee the second is Hillary Clinton had a lot of trouble with men it's like wacka right you have
20:18
to keep men in range for women to take you over the top and men really had
20:24
trouble with Hillary Clinton my own view of it is I desperately want a woman
20:29
president and my own view of it is in 2028 I think we should vow right now on this podcast let's both parties nominate
20:37
a woman and then the voters will have no choice but to give us a woman president
20:42
interesting yeah you know kellyan you wrote in your 2005 book that more than 65% of women across party lines say the
20:49
Integrity of a candidate is more important than his or her intelligence or abilities I was wondering could you
20:55
put that in the context specifically of Donald Trump you know obviously we know that this is someone who back from 2016
21:02
has been you know up until now has been accused of sexual assault caught on tape saying vulgar things about women sad
21:08
with allegations of Affairs and it doesn't seem as if for at least a segment of conservative women that has
21:14
been seen as invalidating how should I understand that in the context of the book which makes a kind of clear data
21:21
case that Integrity or kind of personal convictions of a candidate matter more than intelligence or
21:27
abilities well they're both important there's no question and I just have to fact check you a little bit on he might
21:32
have been accused of sexual assault but he's never been convicted of that or charged with that as far as I know let's
21:38
not civil court there was a finding of liability about sexual abuse and Def yeah let's let's not do that yeah you're
21:44
changing the word so let's not do that that's um because by the way the voters look past snarky comments like that from
21:50
the media and look the idea the obsession with Donald Trump over the last 10 full years now is confounding to
21:57
me and I'm very close to him don't work on his campaign this time we talk frequently
22:03
enough the fact is that if everybody had spent a fraction I mean a fraction a
22:08
cintilla of the time focus on the Trump voter that they obsessed over Trump himself things may be a little bit
22:14
different the fact is that people saw him as coming up with plans and talking
22:20
about issues that no other quote politician had the courage to do and let me tell I'm going to say to you now in
22:25
2024 what I said in 2016 after the Access Hollywood take it to the bank there is a huge
22:32
difference in this country between what offends us and what affects us we like to complain cetch and
22:39
Converse all day long about what offends us and we vote mostly according to what
22:45
affects us and why wouldn't you vote according to what affects you why wouldn't you vote to improve the cost of
22:51
living everyday affordability and the feeling of security and some other issues that are very important and these
22:56
two candidates will be judged mainly on the binary choice that you have on
23:03
how was your life with this one or how was your life with that one it's not since 1892 have we as a country and
23:08
certainly in all of our lifetimes it's the first time have we been able to just put these presidents side by side and
23:14
strip away everything else and take a look at them I hear that distinction between what offends folks versus what
23:21
affects them I will pose the same question to you selinda the book says you know issues of Integrity or morality
23:27
are essential to women and choosing a candidate has your understanding of that shifted in terms of seeing um you know
23:33
how many women are coming back or conservative women are coming back and supporting Donald Trump even amid all of
23:40
you know said scandal I think there's a distinction between personal integrity and public
23:46
Integrity interesting and I think that people processed it's inconceivable to me but I think it's disqualifying that
23:54
people process the Hollywood tape they process some of the court cases that
23:59
have happened and people think of this is I don't want to be married to the guy but that's not what we're talking about here I think the case that the Democrats
24:06
need to make is how this affects you and your family and kellyanne is right about
24:11
that and I think in this latest trial it's actually problematic that it's getting characterized as the hush money
24:18
trial rather than the election Integrity trial the election interference trial
24:25
the strongest court cases were the court cases where there was interference in the election I
24:32
will also say this that I think the strongest case for the Democrats is to play forward what does four more years
24:40
of Joe Biden look like and what does four more years of Donald Trump look like and people are not particularly
24:48
enthusiastic honestly about either one but they really worry about the
24:54
character the public character of the person will it be the Solutions presidency or will it be a Vindication
25:01
and revenge presidency who's going to be the more chaotic leader and you see that
25:07
being a real debate in the voters Minds so I think that the modification I would
25:12
make is character still matters but it's character in the way it affects your life publicly affects Solutions affects
25:20
the focus affects the style of leadership affects the respect affects division polarization not unfortunately
25:28
personal Integrity where voters think aox on most of their
25:34
houses more after the
25:43
break you know kellyan there seems to be an open conversation among the Republican Party specifically on the
25:49
issue of abortion since the fall of roie Wade and the dobs decision we've seen
25:54
conservatives from Donald Trump to Carrie Lake kind of back away from certain pro-life positions and we've
26:00
seen a kind of open debate in the party about where to fall on this issue can you just take me through how you think
26:06
that discussion among Republicans is going to affect them specifically with the electorate and with women sure so if
26:14
it took 50 years to overturn rs's Wade folks should recognize it's going to take more than 50 minutes or 50 hours or
26:21
even 50 weeks to explain what that means and more importantly what it doesn't mean I am 100% prolite but I respect and
26:29
understand why people are pro-choice and knowing that how do we build towards a culture of life I think
26:36
that we should have a more science-based conversation now I think the conversations around religion and
26:41
morality are always important and Women's Health quote unquote are always important so what I would say is 15
26:49
weeks the 15we national minimum standard I think would do two things one is it
26:54
would really dial back some of these states that as we sit here now have
26:59
abortion on the books long after viability frankly long after babies in those states are being born prematurely
27:06
and not just surviving they're thriving so abortion anyone any time anywhere should not be a position in my view of a
27:14
major political party in 2024 in our country that is essentially the position I challenge anyone to show me
27:20
differently I've read the abortion platform for the Democratic party I've memorized the first part of it and so I
27:26
think we have to have both parties in this conversation but I tell you I've never seen the parties more divided on
27:33
any issue I think there is an argument that the Democrats will overplay on this not because it's not important but because it's
27:39
eclipsing inflation security all these other nagging concerns that America's women have as they go to the polls we
27:46
are not single-issue thinkers we are not single issue voters last Point same for the Republican if they think they don't
27:52
need to address abortion because they're only going to talk about inflation and crime and the Border and Ukraine in the
27:58
Middle East and Biden's uh mental and physical agility ability Acuity that's a mistake too so everybody I think ignores
28:06
the fullness of all these issues at their Peril so Linda I would love for you to respond to that I mean to
28:12
kellyanne's point and polling it would say that abortion access is one of the few areas in which the electorate
28:18
prefers Biden over Trump is there any risk of the Democrats limiting their
28:23
pitch to women specifically to an issue and overplaying that hand
28:28
no I think it's a very Salient issue and if anybody's overplayed their hands it's been a lot of Republican legislatures in
28:34
these states I mean states have gone in for banss Republican elected officials
28:39
and candidates have called for bans no exceptions even for wrath and incest when we talk about so-called late term
28:46
abortions every pregnancy is unique at any point in a pregnancy something can go terribly wrong these abortions are
28:53
only 1% of abortions and they are usually of wanted children where something has gone terribly wrong in
29:00
that situation the last thing you need is some unknown politician interfering
29:06
that is a decision that needs to be made by the family and their health care provider and politicians should stay out
29:13
of it so I think the states have gone way too far I think the proof of the pudding was Donald Trump tried to come
29:19
out for a state's rights and 48 hours after Donald Trump said let's leave it
29:25
to the states Arizona goes back to not 1960 but 1860 and the voters concluded some of
29:32
these states are absolutely insane we're not going to leave it up to the states so I think public opinion overwhelmingly
29:39
on our side the number of Voters who are pro-abortion pro personal decisionmaking Pro freedom in making these difficult
29:46
personal decisions has increased dramatically and um we have the ability
29:52
as Democrats as President Obama said we gotta walk and CH at the same time we're able to do that to talk about the
29:58
economy and to talk about abortion and uh those are two major threats of the democratic campaigns okay then one
30:06
question I'll Poe to both of you is what should each candidate be doing in 2024 to better appeal to women I think that
30:13
uh Joe Biden should be talking about K kitchen table economics really really emphasize price couging really emphasize
30:20
rising cost of living not say that things are good say we've worked hard we fought hard to make them better we've
30:26
got lots of work to do and we're going to keep on fighting until families can
30:31
Thrive and prosper and that there are important freedoms and rights and
30:37
questions of control that should not be decided by politicians and uh we have a
30:43
supreme court that has uh overturned a law that was in practice and we had no problems with for 50 years we should not
30:51
be going backwards and kellyan I would pose the same question to you about Trump how does he keep that margin with
30:56
women down president Trump needs to remind America's women of what the economic
31:03
situation and the security situation was when he was president so this is a binary Choice yes it's a referendum on
31:10
Joe Biden's three and a half years as president but it's also a binary Choice did you like your life with Trump or
31:16
under Biden and you can look at any series of issues and make that decision for yourself whether you like Donald
31:23
Trump or not a lot of people in this country do not like the over prosecution that they see of of him if he's so
31:29
harmful to the body politic then why is he still there and they feel that
31:34
attention and resources are being diverted away from the very obvious Clear and Present needs of America's
31:42
women away into these court cases go and beat him let the judge and jury be we
31:47
the people in November and I think the again I'll say it again for women I mean
31:53
president Trump should be consistent with his policies remind them of the Eon the energy Independence that we had more
32:01
Security in our cities certainly abroad foreign policy National Security wise
32:06
and in their pocketbooks their everyday lives and he should stick with his position on abortion then he's leaving
32:11
it to the states um and then I I think the question for both candidates is how much does the energy and enthusiasm that
32:17
each of them get Carri down ballot Republicans did not do well in 2022 we didn't see a red wave I think they they
32:24
missed great opportunities so the question for women who are going to decide who the next president and next
32:29
Senate is do you want divided government to continue or not enough gets done or do you want there to be one party uh
32:37
control where you at least you feel there's an opportunity to have more things pass that affect your everyday life is there a slice of the electorate
32:43
of women that you think is the target area for the Trump campaign I mean you there was so much discussion in 2016
32:50
about white women about white Suburban women and the numbers that went to Trump are you is it about holding that
32:56
together and minimizing losses among women of color do you think the Trump campaign has new opportunities with a
33:01
certain slice of women of color I would love to get more specific is Sinda there uh she she stepped away and so this is
33:07
just my last question to you okay well I didn't I didn't want to hog it no absolutely president Trump has pockets
33:14
of opportunity among female voters that did not exist in 2016 when he was
33:21
running against a woman who many people saw would be the first female president
33:27
United St and that he weren't available to him in 2020 these include younger
33:34
women women of color politically Independent Women some of whom are lapsed Democrats and many of
33:41
whom are just independent why while it has to do with everyday affordability feeling of security and also it has to
33:49
do with the mishandling by President Biden vice president Harris and the Democratic party on this situation in
33:56
the Middle East and president Trump has a tremendous opportunity among non-college educated women of all Races
34:04
all socieconomic backgrounds whether they're married not married children in the house no children in the house
34:10
because that is the biggest demarcation and I was doing a panel recently with Van Jones CNN commentator worked briefly
34:17
for President Obama obviously he wants President Biden to win and he made an excellent point that I wanted to reflect
34:24
here I hadn't thought about it quite this way he said every time the Democrats talk about Suburban women
34:29
Suburban women Suburban women they're missing an opportunity to talk to young black men and young men of color who
34:37
feel my words now somewhat disenfranchised from the Democratic party there's something to that politics
34:44
and resources are finite and so if you're overly talking to quote Suburban
34:50
women many of whom are white then you're not talking to men and I would say women
34:55
of color this election is very important as goes college educated non-college
35:01
educated and when you when you see many of these constitues particularly Hispanic men non- colge educ Hispanic
35:08
men and I'll throw in there to a lesser extent but very measurable in the data non- colge educated African-American men
35:16
you see that the core Coalition that Biden Harris scaffolded together to eek
35:22
it out in 2020 is fraying and straying in a way that should cause them more
35:28
concern and alarm than they seem to have the question remains will they go all the way over to president Trump and he
35:35
needs to earn that and he is earning that um by his messaging but also his delivery
35:42
meaning showing up in places and spaces that make him unafraid to courtt them he famously said in Detroit in 2016 what
35:49
did you have to lose you've been voting for Democrats forever it worked a little bit then it can work a lot more in 2024
35:59
M thank you so much for your time I really appreciate it and uh we'll be back in
36:04
contact the best thank you so much for for having both of us it really means a lot but thanks again for your time we
36:10
really appreciate [Music]
36:16
it so the reason that celinda got quiet at the end there was that our conversation got started a bit late and
36:23
she had to jump to another call but I still had a couple questions for her
36:28
I wanted to know whether there are particular demographic groups of female voters that Biden should be targeting
36:34
and also I wanted to know more about her friendship with kellyan
36:45
Conway hey let me just get in a separate room Hi how are you I'm doing good sorry
36:51
for all the so on Tuesday night I called her back you know one of the things that stuck out to us is that when you go
36:58
through kind of what you all were talking about every Democratic nominee from Obama to Clinton to Biden has won
37:03
the majority of women's votes but every Republican nominee has one more white women do you think Democrats have a
37:10
problem with or a messaging mismatch with specifically white women no I think that we do remarkably
37:19
well with white women uh white women are more conservative they're more likely to be married we do better with unmarried
37:25
voters than married voters so we do quite well with white women compared to
37:30
white men obviously we ultimately would love to win them but we're doing very well with white women and I think it's
37:38
actually improved over the years right yes okay yes particularly as more white women have gotten to college education
37:44
and the marriage rate has gone down among white women you know on the flip side I wanted to ask about Biden's standing with some
37:52
women of color I know that those are a non-monolithic group but we've seen in Poland as I'm sure if you've seen that
37:57
Biden is particularly having kind of approval problems around young people non- white voters non- col voters all
38:03
groups that presumably of course include a lot of women outside of the solutions you outline for Biden already like
38:08
focusing on abortion rights or kitchen table economics is there anything the campaign needs specifically do to speak
38:14
to these more marginalized groups of young women or non- col women are we sure that the broader message to Women
38:19
Voters will also appeal to these more specific groups we seems to be having more trouble with well I think that uh
38:26
the blue colle women uh will be very very appealed to by kitchen table economics and getting Rising costs down
38:34
and the way we need to talk about the economy is not in millions of jobs created or GDP but what bills you had to
38:43
pay what coupons you had to clip what who price gouged you today and what we did about it how that credit card rate
38:49
is going to come down when you're trying to buy your nephew's graduation present it needs to be translated into how real
38:56
people live their lives Liv and how it affects real people in terms of young people they are very pro-abortion they
39:03
are also Pro birth control they are very solidly in support of medication
39:08
abortion they are the ones who are are contemplating IVF if they're having
39:14
issues having a child so this agenda is very very Central to them so for the
39:21
non-oled women I think it's the economy and of course abortion is part of it and
39:27
for the younger women abortion is really really Salient I hear that when we look
39:33
ahead do you think that's what we've been hearing from Biden campaign messages that focus on kitchen table
39:38
economics does the campaign have a problem when we look at non-oled women or other groups that the numbers would
39:45
tell us are less hot on Biden than some others well I think Democrats have had a
39:50
problem for some time and we've been increasing our vote with college educated women and declining with non-
39:57
col educated women and I think we'll see the same focus and we need to see the same Focus reiterated and right now
40:04
college educated America is just feeling that they're doing a lot better than non- college educated America who are
40:10
really impressed with Rising prices really looking for a side hustle to add to that job to try to make in Meet
40:17
really feel that they're falling behind and we need to be in touch with that we as Democrats not just the administration
40:23
but we as Democrats need to do something about it the last question I wanted to ask you is about something that really
40:29
jumped out to me as you all were talking which is just that how close you all seem to be it took me back to time in
40:35
politics where those kind of cross-party relationships seem to happen more often but you know also I was reminded of you
40:41
know some of the criticisms people have made about Washington politics saying it's kind of too chummy between D's and
40:46
rs I wanted to pose that question to you like what do you think are the values of those cross-party relationships and
40:52
being friends with someone who is also your maybe political rival
40:58
well first of all as a pollster I think it's a lot easier because the data is the data and if our data really differs
41:05
then we would be worried about that we would want to compare notes now we might want to do different things with the
41:10
data but the data is the data I think also both of us started when there
41:16
weren't that many women in our respective fields and so um we balanced
41:23
family and work and caregiving responsibilities and so uh we just had a
41:29
very very deep respect and I think one of the the beginnings of ending the
41:34
polarization is we have to listen to each other we have to respect each other we have to look for common ground yeah I
41:40
I wonder if that has that gotten any harder in the Trump era I mean I hear President Biden I hear Democrats kind of
41:47
making a clear argument that you know the other side represents more than the kind of existential threat to the
41:53
political system but also to the lives of women obviously kellyan Conway is one of the the chief architects of Trump's
41:58
rise and message I guess I wanted to ask like watch Americans outside the Beltway take seriously the idea that Maga
42:04
Republicans are a danger to the country's core if Democrats inside of the Beltway seem to be friends with
42:10
them oh that's an interesting question well I don't see myself as a friend of Mega Republicans uh in fact I work very
42:18
very hard to beat them every day and I by the way I don't think Mega Republicans are the same thing as
42:24
Republicans I was born and raised a republic on a ranch in Montana I was a teenage Republican officeholder I have a
42:32
lot of family that are still Republicans but this is a new game in town but that's different than an individualized
42:38
working relationship and I think that uh we can recognize that and I think if there were
42:46
more of that and less of the polarization we'd be better off I hear you but it has gotten harder in the
42:52
Trump era oh it's definitely gotten harder in the Trump era
42:57
I I think it's intuitive but is there a why is there a moment you remember is there an example of
43:03
that I think that um you know we we always knew we disagreed on the abortion
43:09
issue and that's why we didn't put it in the book but obviously the do's decision was a very hard moment because you know
43:17
I am old enough to remember when abortion wasn't legal and so that was
43:22
very sobering and I think that you know ironically the Biden vote and the Trump
43:27
vote are all about Trump and I think that for Democrats Trump is just such a
43:33
different kind of candidate different than any Republican we've ever had different than any candidate we've ever
43:39
had and he tests the boundaries of our system he tests the very basis of our
43:44
democracy and it makes it harder to be friends with one of the key advisers for
43:50
him but I still respect Kellan very much as a mother as a woman as a strategist
43:56
as a PO and uh as someone who's been a woman in a tough field MH thank you so much I
44:03
appreciate you following up on our questions and taking some time out thank you again for your time okay thank you
44:09
so much and thanks for doing it in bits and pieces no no problem you have a great rest of your day talk to you soon
