Is the 2024 Election Already Heading to the Supreme Court?


0:01
so after much anticipation it's finally 2024 which not only marks the start of
0:08
an election year but opens a new chapter in this campaign people will start
0:13
voting soon and in States like Iowa New Hampshire Nevada and South Carolina it's
0:20
getting to be crunch time for the candidates but this year while all that typical campaigning is still happening
0:27
another storyline has taken off which could matter even more than any individual candidate now former
0:33
president Trump fighting to keep his name on the Republican primary ballot in Colorado and Maine the Supreme Court of
0:39
Colorado and Maine Secretary of State have each ruled that the former president is not eligible to run for a
0:45
second term in the White House two states Colorado and Maine are saying
0:50
that Donald Trump can't be on the ballot at all they say that his actions on January 6th violated the 14th Amendment
0:57
ban on insurrectionist holding federal office they're basing this on a clause in the 14th Amendment which bars
1:03
candidates from Office who have engaged in Insurrection against the United States Maine Secretary of State who
1:10
ruled on the issue put it this way Mr Trump was aware of the Tinder he laid in
1:16
a multi-on efforts to challenge the legitimacy of the 2020 election and then
1:23
in an unprecedented and tragic series of events chose to light a match and the
1:28
Trump campaign back eventually appealing the decision in State Court a trump
1:33
campaign spokesperson releasing a scathing statement writing in part we are witnessing in real time the
1:39
attempted theft of an election and the disenfranchisement of the American voter more than a dozen similar cases are
1:46
pending and in some other states officials have ruled in the opposite way on the same issue saying that Trump is
1:53
eligible to be on the ballot now the Supreme Court faces mounting pressure to wade into Uncharted constitutional
1:59
territory and settle these 14th Amendment questions once and for all the
2:05
question is almost certainly headed to the Supreme Court especially because on Wednesday Trump filed a petition asking
2:12
the court to keep him on Colorado's primary ballot separately the court
2:17
might also consider a key aspect in one of the criminal cases against Trump the question of presidential
2:24
immunity which means that what was already seeming like a big role for the court in the 24 election feels like it's
2:31
getting bigger by the debt and remember the last time that
2:37
happened in
2:43
2000 you can't steal this one you're not going to steal this
2:51
one it got pretty messy you can't steal this
2:57
one C all the votes from The New York Times I'm aad
3:03
hearnen this is the
3:11
runup hey Adam how are you he dead so to try and make sense of all this I call my
3:17
colleague Adam lipac who covers the Supreme Court it's uh the first day of
3:22
2024 you have any New Year's resolutions it's going to be it's going to be a hell of a year looks like yeah yeah that's my
3:28
personal resolution is like surviv [Laughter] I'm just giving myself like full reign
3:33
of just like make it to the end exactly just survive um it's less than two weeks
3:40
before anyone starts voting and it's really kind of becoming real in the election sense for us and part of the
3:46
reason we wanted to talk to you is because we're already having a question about Donald Trump's eligibility and it
3:54
feels kind of Tangled some states have ruled that Donald Trump is ineligible for the ballot two states specifically
3:59
Colorado and Maine can you talk us through what's been happening in those States and what is the kind of legal
4:06
process that's been playing out across the country so there are lots and lots of challenges brought under a previously
4:13
obscure part of the 14th Amendment the amendment enacted after the Civil War
4:19
that at a broad level of generality and maybe we'll drill down on this instead but it says that officials who have
4:26
taken an oath to support the Constitution are not eligible to hold office if they have engaged in an
4:33
Insurrection and those two states have said that Donald Trump's conduct in
4:39
plotting to overturn the election culminating in the events of January 6th
4:44
fit that pattern and therefore he's not eligible to be on the primary ballots in
4:49
those two states but the logic of the position would knock him off of every ballot everywhere primary or general and
4:58
that really makes you think that this issue of national scope ought to be
5:04
decided by the nation's National highest tribunal the US Supreme Court so the
5:09
issue of question here is a clause in the 14th amendment that states that an individual who has taken an oath to
5:15
protect the Constitution cannot hold office in the future if they have engaged in Insurrection like how do this
5:21
legal Theory or or how does this kind of come to be in terms of rising up to get to this point well the logic of it in
5:27
the post Civil War makes a ton of sense right you don't want those people who have taken up arms against the federal
5:35
government to be eligible to hold office maybe iead we should actually look at
5:40
the words of the 14th Amendment because I think that'll bring it into into scope it's a little Tangled but it's got four
5:47
basic pieces it specifies which offices
5:52
we're talking about it specified who is barred from holding those offices if if
5:59
they have and here's the third part engaged in Insurrection and then it makes the interesting additional point
6:06
that Congress can by a two-thirds vote of each house give amnesty remove such
6:12
disability so let let me read the words of the thing and see if it makes more sense that way so first we're going to
6:18
talk about what offices are in play and as as I read this listen for does it
6:24
talk about the president specifically no person shall be a senator or represent pres ative in
6:30
Congress or elector of President and Vice President meaning a member of the
6:35
Electoral College or hold any office civil or military under the United
6:41
States or under any state now there's no specific reference to the president
6:46
there's the electors of the president members of the elector electoral college but it does say hold any office civil or
6:54
military under the United States and there's some dispute about whether the
6:59
presidency is a office under the United States but the constitution in many
7:05
other places refers to the office of the presidency so that's first of all what
7:10
positions are covered now let's turn to who who is barred and again let's look
7:15
to see if the president is in here someone who has previously taken an oath as a member of Congress or as an officer
7:22
of the United States or as a member of any state legislature or as an executive
7:28
or judicial officer of state to support the Constitution of the United States
7:33
now here again there's some dispute about whether the president is an officer of the United States but most
7:40
people at least in a colloquial sense would certainly think he is and Donald Trump took a presidential oath that's
7:47
doesn't have the word support in it but it sure sounds like he's pledged to
7:53
support the Constitution of the United States then there's the question of okay
7:59
okay let's say you've taken this oath let's say it applies to one of these
8:05
offices what do you have to have done to be disqualified right and it says and the
8:11
antecedent here is support the Constitution of the United States so shall have engaged in Insurrection or
8:19
Rebellion against the same or given Aid or Comfort to the enemies thereof
8:25
against the same meaning either the Constitution of the United States or the United States not completely clear which
8:31
is the antecedent but in any event this question of does what Trump did in the
8:38
runup to and during the January 6th attack on the capital amount to
8:44
Insurrection and there are lots of definitions from the era in which this
8:50
uh provision was adopted that strongly suggest that this is the kind of
8:57
political violence meant to frustrate the operation of government that fits pretty nicely within the definition of
9:03
insurrection so you put all these pieces together and uh you have two states
9:10
saying it fits it's required it's a qualification to take office it's no
9:16
different from the requirement that you be 35 years old or that you be a natural born citizen of the United States the
9:22
logic of these states is there are lots of people who would like to vote for Donald Trump but you can't cuz the
9:28
Constitution say so okay so this is really helpful so it's not just the question of did Donald
9:34
Trump engage in Insurrection and that automatically kind of throws make someone ineligible to hold office there
9:39
is a kind of criteria that the amendment lays out that these cases are going to test broadly one if the president as a
9:47
figure fits in this criteria did Donald Trump then do the right actions that fall into the category of insurrection
9:54
all of that stuff has to add up to something that then leads these states to deem him ineligible is this like a
10:03
widely accepted legal Theory are these states applying something novel and new
10:08
and this is kind of like new ground that we're covering here I guess I'm wondering how widely accepted are the
10:14
leaps that these states are taking uh how widely accepted are they in the kind of legal community so if by legal
10:20
Community we mean judges yeah this is Virgin Territory almost entirely if by
10:27
legal Community we mean con constitutional Scholars including prominent conservative constitutional
10:33
Scholars I wouldn't call it a consensus but I would say that a
10:39
majority of prominent constitutional Scholars think that the logic of the
10:48
Colorado and Main rulings are correct
10:53
and that's not super new I mean this has been an obscure area of the law but you
10:59
know legal scholars study obscure areas of law that's their jam and and they say
11:04
it works as a legal matter now we're going to get all different kinds of answers the
11:10
California election official came to the opposite conclusion and said that Trump
11:16
is eligible to run these cases arise in different procedural settings some of
11:22
them are limited to the primaries some of them say a voter doesn't have
11:27
standing to bring this claim there are a million kind of legal crosscurrents now that leaves open the
11:34
question of the Practical and political consequences and what the Supreme Court
11:40
if it gets this case is going to do with it but although obscure although
11:46
untested it's a serious question the other question I have about the two states Colorado and Maine is that if I'm
11:53
understanding it correctly Colorado happened because of a a decision from the state supreme court where Maine was a decision from the state's secretary of
12:01
state is there any difference uh legally in how this happened is there any way
12:06
that distinction is important I don't think the mechanics of it matter that much both cases were
12:12
brought by voters the Colorado case was a lawsuit against the Secretary of State
12:18
asking the court to force her to knock Trump off the ballot so States will have different procedures and there may be
12:26
you know roadblocks and hurdles and exit ramps and procedural nonsense but they
12:31
all get to the same point I mean at some point we really need a definitive answer
12:37
to does this provision of the Constitution which makes at least some
12:43
people ineligible to hold office apply to Donald Trump yeah the Colorado case is already at the court in
12:51
the following sense the Colorado Republican party last week went to the
12:56
court asked the court to hear uh its appeal urg the court to move very fast
13:02
to resolve the matter by super Tuesday I mean it does feel I mean we're about to be in Iowa and it does feel a little
13:09
surreal that voters are going to start weighing in on a candidate in person who they don't fully know is going to be
13:16
eligible uh come November what is the likelihood that the court does move fast
13:22
and what is the timeline I me you mentioned super Tuesday as the one request is that timeline realistic I could imagine
13:29
the court setting the case down for argument in January and issuing a decision in
13:36
February I think they're they're capable of doing that bush Vore worked rather faster than that now Bush Vore might not
13:43
be the best example of the Court's finest work yeah like you're going to trigger some people rega this back to
13:49
push M Gore is that the territory we're in here uh I think it's comparable but Bush regor was about one state and this
13:55
is about the entire National president IAL elal system MH so I mean the court
14:02
will not be pleased to make this decision would rather not deal with it
14:07
but probably can't avoid it do we have a sense of what the Supreme Court is likely to do
14:14
here the good news for Donald Trump is that there are enough different issues
14:20
in the case and we haven't even talked about some of them like should does Congress have to enact a law under the
14:27
14th Amendment before judges can do anything there there are all kinds of threshold issues that the court could
14:35
find a way to leave him on the ballot even as it takes no position on or even
14:42
accepts for the sake of argument that he engaged in Insurrection this is a very
14:47
delicate business for the court I and I'm not sure although of obviously it's a 63 court with six Republican
14:54
appointees three of them appointed by Donald Trump I'm not not sure it breaks
15:00
along those lines and they may well look for some narrow technical way to leave
15:06
him on the ballot without at the same time ruling on whether he was an
15:12
insurrectionist it's a very delicate business for the court one question I have as a kind of lay person is like you
15:19
mentioned the partisanship of the Court three justices appointed by Donald Trump six kind of conservatives is there any
15:26
Universe for that kind of partisan makeup would throw him off the ballot so I don't think this court
15:35
particularly likes Donald Trump I don't even think the Trump appoes particularly
15:41
like Donald Trump and in cases where you remember iead there were subpoena cases while he
15:48
was a sitting president from Congress and from the Manhattan da Trump lost
15:54
those cases 7 to2 with all of his justices of the majority and only Alo
16:00
and Thomas in descent so for sure there's a partisan tilt to the court in
16:05
many settings but Trump is a little bit of a special case at the same time it's
16:12
a very very very big move whatever the partisan composition of the court to say
16:18
that a leading candidate for the presidency cannot run and the voters may not themselves assess whether his
16:26
conduct was disqualifying so this case really puts the court in a
16:32
pickle it's going to be a Highwire act you know we mentioned how there's so many cases that are moving along on this
16:38
front in a lot of different states is what I'm hearing from you that when the Supreme Court weighs in on
16:45
Colorado that's going to affect all these other cases too right they don't will they have to weigh in on each
16:50
individual one or is there going to be a ruling that kind of like puts the eligibility question to bed soon
16:57
probably they will rule Ru in a way that controls every single case in every single state okay are they are they
17:03
capable of ruling in a Colorado only way sure they could say that some provision of Colorado law is special and therefore
17:11
this case could not have been brought and we'll wait for the next case they could do that I don't think they'll do
17:18
that I think they'll reach the larger issues and I don't think they want to have several bites at this apple this is
17:23
an apple they don't want at all yeah you know Gavin Newsome the Democratic governor of California said you know in
17:29
California quote we defeat candidates we don't like it the polls everything else is a political distraction youve heard
17:35
we've had some Democrats even come out and say that they're kind of uncomfortable with the idea of Donald
17:40
Trump being thrown off the ballot that it's kind of a a Goa rather than a kind of core political argument for defeating
17:48
him how much are these kind of partisan fights going to weigh on the court if at
17:55
all so that argument is superficially appealing that voters should decide if
18:02
Donald Trump did something bad voters should take account of that and if they think it was bad enough they shouldn't
18:08
vote for him at the same time instead the thing that he's accused of doing is
18:14
so profoundly anti-democratic to try to undo an election that it's a hell of a thing to
18:20
say because we're so committed to democracy we're going to let the voters decide when the very act in question was
18:28
an attempt to subvert democracy it's a it's a great point because I really do think that like you know we can talk out
18:35
of both sides of our mouth on this thing I'm like I totally see the the argument that voters should be able to decide
18:42
this that this is a kind of political matter on its face but to your point like if engaging in an Insurrection or
18:49
blocking the transfer of power or plotting against the government is not enough to kick in said Clause that's in
18:55
the Constitution it does kind of beg the question of like what is it there for then you know like it does feel as if at
19:01
some point the words have to matter even though I totally understand the voter argument and I think a lot of people are
19:07
really more comfortable with the voter argument right but it's possible there are parts of the Constitution that are
19:15
anti-democratic yeah that's important that's an important Point too the other qualifications for president you got to
19:20
be 35 I may want to vote for a 30-year-old uh you got to be a natural
19:26
born citizen of the United States I might want vote for someone born in France you're saying there's a lot of
19:32
things that we actually understand that the constitution lays out in terms of these requirements and not being an
19:39
insurrectionist is one of them uh let me ask like kind of last
19:44
couple questions you know we also did an episode recently about Trump's other legal problems I'm thinking of his kind
19:51
of state criminal cases in New York and Georgia also the federal cases brought by special counsel Jack Smith it seems
19:57
as if there's a big question of kind of presidential immunity in the federal cases that the Supreme Court might also
20:04
have to weigh in on do we have a sense on when and how the court might weigh in
20:09
on that front also I think they're likely to weigh in on it soon the
20:15
federal appeals court in Washington is going to hear arguments on January 9 on
20:21
whether Trump enjoys absolute immunity from Criminal prosecution that Court
20:26
will almost certainly act fast uh the losing side will almost certainly
20:32
go to the Supreme Court and I think the court will hear that case and might like
20:37
to hear that case in tandem with the one we've been talking about because it
20:44
could give the court an opportunity to give something to each side the immunity
20:49
argument is a real stretch and the court won't have a lot of problem rejecting it
20:56
I predict and if they give Trump a loss on that one and a win on the eligibility
21:03
14th Amendment one then maybe it seems like they're being even handed it's interesting the kind of
21:09
Optics of it all might lead them you're saying to put these cases together but it also really reminds me you mentioned
21:16
Bush Gore of just what of a massive role the Supreme Court is about to have in
21:21
the early stages of this race not only the presidential immunity ruling or the eligibility questions but thinking back
21:28
to the dobs decision of course the decision on student loans how much this court has really dramatically shaped the
21:33
first few years of the Biden Administration it will shape next this year's I said next year I'm so used to saying it this year's presidential
21:40
election uh it feels kind of unprecedent it to me but as someone who has studied
21:46
the court how unique is the current position that it's in it's a very
21:52
powerful Court some people call it an Imperial Court it's partly a consequence
21:58
of the fact that Congress is gridlocked and not able to do anything it's partly
22:04
a consequence of the Court being very assertive in thrusting itself into the middle of
22:12
every major controversy seemingly abortion guns religion the climate
22:18
student loans affirmative action so you I don't want to make broad
22:24
historical claims but in the 15 years I've been covering the court this court now with a six Justice
22:31
conservative super majority seems uh very eager as a general matter to get
22:37
into and decide all of the big issues of the day but even as I say that I would
22:43
footnote that that some of these election cases they're going to go into
22:48
holding their noses because they know nothing good is going to come for the court whatever they do in this yeah on
22:55
this question of Eligibility half the country is going to be Furious I mean the last question I would ask is like if
23:01
uh you could kind of crystal ball this year of the court with the Trump
23:08
eligibility coming soon with the question of presidential immunity coming soon how much of this do you think is
23:15
going to be a kind of Legacy defining year for a Roberts Court that's already had so many of those
23:21
moments yeah so I would have thought that this would be a quiet term they had two huge terms before the one that
23:28
started in October but these Trump cases depending on how they come out and
23:33
depending on how they affect the election could be the biggest term of
23:39
the Roberts Court you know which has been in business since uh 2005 yeah and it's hard to predict this dead because
23:45
we've got four different criminal trials on the runway they are going to produce
23:52
issues we haven't even thought about and it's not hard for them to speed to the
23:57
Supreme Court in a matter of weeks so this will be a uh a busy time for
24:03
covering the chord yeah when I think about the actors that are going to matter so much for the
24:10
race you know we think about the nominees we think about the parties but it's really making clear to me we have
24:15
to think about the court in that same category because they're going to play such a big role this year that's exactly
24:21
right thank you so much I really appreciate your time thanks for having
24:26
me more after the [Music]
24:36
break after talking with Adam I had a better sense of the legal questions at play when it comes to Trump's ballot
24:43
eligibility but I still wanted to talk with someone on the state level who was directly involved in the initial
24:49
decision to remove his name from the ballot secretary BOS thank you for joining us uh welcome and happy New Year
24:55
thank you so much Happy New Year I'm thrilled to to be here so on Tuesday afternoon I called main Secretary of
25:01
State shna Bellos I wanted to know about her ruling but I also wanted to
25:07
understand how she was thinking about the politics of it all considering her decision has already had such huge
25:13
political impacts I want to jump into the conversation pretty quick here take
25:18
me through the explanation of how this question of whether Trump is eligible to be on the 2024 ballot in Maine came to
25:24
your desk oh I'm so glad you asked that question because Maine is unique to my
25:29
knowledge no other state has a process quite like this under main election law which is title 21A for those legal Geeks
25:37
out there once the secretary has made the initial qualification of any candidate for the ballot and I did that
25:44
my office verified Mr Trump's signatures and indicated that he had met that requirement any registered main voter
25:51
may bring a challenge to the candidate's qualifications under main law they don't
25:56
have the option of going right to court they must bring that challenge to the secretary in this case five registered
26:03
main voters did so including two former Republican state senators under the law
26:08
I as secretary I'm required to hold an administrative hearing and then must issue a decision following the
26:15
conclusion of the hearing proceedings and what's important was that the weight
26:21
of the evidence made clear that not only were the events of January 6 tragic and
26:28
unprecedented but that they did meet the definition of
26:33
insurrection and that those events um which were an attack not only on the capital and government officials but
26:40
also attack on the peaceful transfer of power and the rule of law the evidence presented at the hearing demonstrated
26:47
they occurred at the behest of and with the knowledge and support of the outgoing president and uh section three
26:53
of 14th Amendment is clear the Constitution does not tolerate an assault on the foundations of our
26:59
government uh main election law required me to act I hear what you're saying you know I wasn't particularly familiar with
27:05
this specific Clause of the 14th Amendment or you know to be honest with you the argument in general but one of
27:10
the things I have learned is that there are questions Beyond just whether Donald Trump uh engaged an Insurrection on the
27:17
six questions about whether this Clause would even apply to the president there not a universally accepted kind of legal
27:23
Theory I guess I'm wondering considering the range of opinions on this did that factor into you making such a decision
27:30
that was going to resonate so broadly how did you weigh what um seems to be several legal questions at once so my
27:37
obligation under the law was to review and uh make a determination on all of
27:43
the legal questions brought forward in the hearing in the record one thing I
27:49
want to make clear for your listeners however is this is the first step in the process I voluntarily in the last page
27:56
of my decision suspended the effect of my decision uh stayed my decision
28:01
pending appeal to the courts because the next step is an appeal to Superior Court and then the main Supreme Judicial Court
28:08
and the US Supreme Court and certainly the courts will weigh in and my decision will be upheld or overturned I will
28:14
comply with whatever the courts direct me to do that's my obligation as uh Secretary of State under the law maybe
28:22
it's just because I'm a political reporter but I'm also thinking about the amount of Republicans we have talked in
28:27
the last year who are getting ready to votee for Donald Trump who have made arguments saying that uh Democratic
28:33
elected officials across the country are seeking to keep him from Office outside of the democratic process to remove that
28:40
agency from voters I've even seen some Democratic elected officials say a kind of similar argument saying that the
28:46
power should really rest with the people not necessarily these officials I would love a clear response to that uh
28:52
argument I know you're kind of saying the Constitution should come first but it does feel like there's an inevitable political backlash with decisions like
28:58
this is it were you just blocking that out I was blocking it out okay my
29:04
personal safety the political considerations my personal views none of that could enter in because the
29:10
constitution of the law required me to review solely and exclusively the
29:15
evidence in the record but I do want to address this so article one of the Constitution leaves it up to the states
29:21
to determine their election laws article one of the Constitution also leaves it up to the states the administration of
29:28
Elections that's why you see such a variability but it's not the states that set the qualifications for office that's
29:35
the Constitution and looking at Main law it was very clear to me uh if Barack
29:40
Obama or George W bush wanted to run for president and submitted the 2,000 signatures required I would be
29:47
prohibited from placing them on the ballot if an 18-year-old or non-citizen
29:52
sought to be placed on the presidential ballot in main I would be prohibited from placing them on the ballot so under
29:59
main law the the qualifications in the Constitution they're not a menu yeah they're requirements I totally hear that
30:05
I guess I'm wondering someone not being 35 is a fact right someone having served two terms in office previously is a fact
30:13
whether Donald Trump engaged in Insurrection is not a legally defined fact at least at this point he has not been convicted of doing so in the court
30:20
how is this decision the same I guess considering there is that kind of legal
30:25
distinction between something that has been established and something that it seems like at least in here you are
30:32
establishing through the hearing do you what I'm saying I do there there are two
30:37
things that I would say so first you know in my decision I determined that
30:42
the record demonstrated that Mr Trump engaged in the Insurrection of January 6
30:47
2021 and as part of the exhibits and accept as part of the record uh those
30:53
included nonpartisan reports from the Senate from the government Accounting Office the GAO from the defense
31:01
department there were a variety of you know the January 6 report which was also nonpartisan and so it was my review of
31:08
the evidence that day that more than 2,000 people entered the capital and
31:14
were present according to the GAO for seven hours attacking police officers
31:20
that seven deaths resulted and it was attack not just on those police officers
31:26
but on the peaceful trans ER of power that is what led to my determination
31:31
that it was an Insurrection now in my decision I do note that it's a closer
31:38
question of whether Mr Trump engaged in Insurrection it would have been clear
31:44
should Mr Trump have been found guilty or not guilty in a criminal court that would be an easier question but section
31:50
three of the 14th Amendment does not say convicted it says engaged and so I was
31:56
compelled by law based on facts and legal arguments to make a determination
32:01
now the courts will weigh in right the courts will determine whether that analysis and that reasoning was sound
32:09
will you only look back at this decision if it is upheld positively it does or
32:15
does that not matter about whether the appell courts actually agree with your reasoning or not do you I no it doesn't
32:20
matter I'll do whatever the courts tell me to do no no I understand that I guess I'm saying when you think back to your
32:26
initial decision this reasoning here doesn't matter what the courts end up saying after cuz I'm thinking about a
32:31
situation where Donald Trump ends back on the ballot and uh you know the impact of some of these moments could be that
32:37
it fuels a general perception that folks are trying to keep him off that's a political impact but I'm saying when I
32:44
heard earlier it sounds like you were saying all of that stuff doesn't matter exactly because I have a job to do Under
32:50
the Constitutional law and it would be irresponsible like it would be unacceptable for me not to do my job and
32:57
not to follow the Constitution and sometimes you know secretaries of State get get challenged in court that's part
33:04
of the process all of the time it's not personal it's not political it's what does the law tell you and that's the way
33:12
it should work is to follow established legal processes wherever they take you
33:20
even and I do want to talk for a minute even if it means an individual coming to
33:26
personal harm or there being political consequences so you know I anticipated
33:32
criticism I anticipated feedback yeah I was ask about this yeah I did not anticipate that I the people who work
33:40
for me my family would be targeted with abusive aggressive and threatening
33:48
Communications starting immediately start all day Friday and then I certainly did not
33:57
anticipate that my house would be swatted on Friday night now my husband and I were away for the holiday weekend
34:04
and law enforcement has been spectacular nothing happened but just because it was a fake call swatting is
34:11
fake calls right doesn't mean it was any less dangerous you know my personal home
34:16
address was posted online and I was receiving an incredible number of angry
34:21
calls to my office but also to my personal cell phone which of course I wasn't answering but it was
34:27
you know all of this and I think the swatting and and also the targeting of my family that is unacceptable and it's
34:34
time to deescalate the rhetoric it is time to tone down
34:40
Communications we follow the law we can agree to disagree without threats of
34:45
violence I you know those things are not only uh upsetting I'm sorry those things are happening it follows a trend too of
34:51
voting workers and what we seen in the 2020 election that that Spectre of violence has been used by by many to be
34:57
a real intimidating force and that is a trend that continues to be concerning you know you mentioned the deescalation
35:04
of retoric the Trump campaign is obviously unhappy with this decision and wrote that we are witnessing in real
35:09
time the attempted theft of an election and the disenfranchisement of the American voter that's not uh toned down
35:16
of rhetoric as you mentioned but they're also framing your own actions as something that escalates political
35:22
intensity what would you say to that as uh as you know it's certainly not swatting it's certainly not this type of
35:29
violent rhetoric that we've seen come from Trump but it is an action to remove some are you comparing my uh following
35:35
the law under main statute to I'm comparing the partisan no I'm comparing the partisan politics really not
35:41
partisan it is really not partisan and here's the thing it's really important that we stop thinking about the politics
35:49
and start thinking about the law and where the law leads us and where the Constitution leads us and we may you
35:55
know we can agree to disagree we can have different views Mr Trump has that option
36:01
to appeal this week in court and no like no doubt he will but the political
36:07
tactics so for example some Republicans in M have called for my impeachment well
36:13
that is absurd under Main's Constitution I was doing my duty I was doing my job
36:19
but it's the same type of rhetoric that you see in Washington DC right and I think violence and threats of violence
36:26
have to be different than administrative procedures and an elected official following their obligations under
36:34
statute my last question would be if you had a general message to main voters maybe even main Republicans who were
36:39
thinking that they were going to have an opportunity to vote for Donald Trump and they're now hearing some of this kind of rhetoric that you mentioned what what
36:46
would be your message to the Trump voters of M so I also want to make one thing clear the effect of suspending my
36:52
decision means that Trump hasn't been removed from the ballot it will depend on the courts so so that's first and
36:57
foremost and second though everyone has to follow the law I'm mindful that no
37:03
secretary of state has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on section three of the 14th Amendment yeah I'm also mindful however
37:11
that no presidential candidate has ever before engaged in Insurrection if you do not meet the qualifications of the
37:17
office if you're 18 if you've been president twice you're not eligible for the office yeah I appreciate your time
37:25
you know a part the reason I'm asking the like political point is because you know I understand that like Secretary of
37:30
States are uh comound by kind of legal requirements and see that really clearly
37:36
but so much of this is reverberated in different spheres and you know the one we live in is a political one so thank
37:41
you I appreciate you for taking those questions thank you so much I appreciate your time today yeah have a great day
37:46
you too take care as of the end of the day Wednesday
37:54
everyone is still waiting waiting for this Supreme Court to make a decision on the Colorado case waiting to see how the
38:00
Trump campaign's appeal in Maine moves forward but now that it's the new year
38:06
one thing we don't have to wait much longer for is for actual voting to get
38:16

weeks for Nikki Haley thank you Ambassador please um what was the cause
38:43
of the United States Civil
38:50
War well don't come with an easy question anything I mean I think the cause of the Civil War was basically how
38:55
government was going going to run the freedoms and what people could and couldn't do what do you think the cause
39:02
of the Civil War was she's been dealing with controversy after an audience member at a New Hampshire town hall
39:08
seemed to catch her off guard with a question about the Civil War in the year 20123 it's astonishing to me that you
39:15
answer that question without mentioning the word slavery what do you want me to say no um
39:23
You' answer my question thank in the days that follow she's tried to clean up what she said of
39:30
course the Civil War was about slavery we know that that's
39:35
unquestioned always the case we know the Civil War was about slavery yes I know
39:40
it was about slavery I'm from the south of course you know it's about slavery Ronda santz and other GOP Challengers
39:48
paled on the minute that she faces any type of scrutiny uh she tends to Cave
39:54
she did it because she's unwilling to offend anyone by telling the truth there
40:01
are seven candidates left in the Republican primary race although Chris Christie Chris Christie is a friend but
40:07
his race is at an absolute dead end is facing pressure to drop out he released

40:18
saying Donald Trump is a liar pushing back on that idea what kind of President do we want a liar or someone who's got

the guts to tell the truth as for the front runner Donald Trump released a holiday message on Truth
