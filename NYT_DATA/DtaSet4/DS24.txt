Election 2024: How Political Polls Really Work


0:03
hi my name is Leslie and I live in Virginia hi I'm Michael in Albuquerque New Mexico hi my name is Henry hi this
0:09
is Christian from Texas hi this is Pete hi this is Christian from Sacramento
0:15
when people reach out to us with questions I'm wondering how polling works I'm curious about polling in
0:21
general I have a question about polling data my question is about polling methodology one of the things they ask
0:27
about most is polling is polling relevant have the polling tactics changed since 2020 how do pollsters
0:34
reach out to people is it via cell phone is it text links things like that a lot
0:40
of younger voters don't have landlines or reliably answer their phone how do you get a reliable poll sample from this
0:46
population I know a lot of pre-election hype is based on the polls but I don't know anyone in my circles at least and I
0:52
sure haven't been part of poll questions thanks we're still weeks away from Super
0:59
Tuesday and usually around this time in the primary season most of the attention
1:04
when it comes to polling is around who's going to capture the nomination but this year with the race all but set we're
1:12
looking at 9 months of polling on two men we already know very
1:17
well today and by popular demand how exactly does polling work and what can
1:24
we expect from it this year from The New York Times I'm aad hearon
1:30
this is the run
1:38
up so we're doing a poll in gosh in two
1:44
weeks um the last time the New York Times did a poll my colleague Caitlyn tagged along with the times polling team
1:51
Nate con Will Davis and Ruth agel Nick to get an inside look on how it works I
1:57
guess my main question for you is what are the types of questions you wish were being asked you don't see being asked
2:04
like what are the areas where you would like to probe public opinion on the Trump trials first the team sat down
2:12
with reporters and editors Across The Newsroom I'm interested as a baseline if
2:18
people even care all that much about them and who cares more than others I
2:24
don't know how you phrase that question but like we can work that and asked them what they were curious about you know
2:30
then they met as a team so things we want to ask don't want to ask with a
2:35
tiered system right ask on both ask only on web to figure out how to best translate the things people wanted to
2:42
know but if we're aiming for a 12 minute I think we said 12 minutes for phone so
2:48
we're probably aiming for 30ish substantive questions maybe 25 inable
2:54
questions will and I talked to Alan fer who covers the Trump trials and
3:00
I think it would be good to ask some version of kind of a comparison between these four trials yeah I mean there's
3:06
really I mean there are a lot of different dimensions here right there's the did he do it did he not do it is this a crime is it not a crime is it
3:13
very bad versus not so bad they had hours of meetings we can definitely
3:18
argue I mean we've we've argued about wording for hours but I think that we're on a time table that like let's get
3:24
everything in place and then know how much time we have to argue about wording yeah Monday and Tuesday will be our
3:29
wording arguing days yeah this one needs work still the um
3:36
nominee if if Donald Trump wins V he should still be the Republican nominee even crime there too many ifs
3:42
potentially but that's the well that's we can with it once the questions were finalized my colleague Caitlyn drove up
3:49
to Sienna College in Upstate New York and we're going this door this door Sienna partners with the times to
3:55
conduct its polling so we are located in a residence hall
4:01
okay sure it turns out the Sienna College Research Institute the double doors are there students who live in
4:08
here okay second third and fourth floor so you'll hear Basset balls through the ceiling it's located in the dorm
4:15
basement smoke go walk from things they shouldn't be doing inside and down the hall from a laundry room so this is our
4:21
call center in here we have uh 34 individual call stations and so folks
4:28
are working in here and each person is sitting there at their screen it's the call center where the poll goes out and
4:34
they're given an assigned phone number and the people there were a mix I'm Kaitlyn hi Kaitlin nice to meet you I'm
4:40
Lynn what are your name I'm Rebecca I'm Catherine cine I'm Denise Denise
4:45
Charlotte Wilkins there were students locals and some experienced callers they
4:52
were all having a pretty common experience hi this is Sam calling from Sienna College Research Institute we're
4:58
speaking briefly today to voters in your area and no one will try to sell you anything is this a safe time to talk
5:03
with you are you sure your opinion is valued
5:09
and it won't take long okay thank you so there she didn't want
5:17
to did she say why um she's like I don't know who you are so I don't want to talk to you I was like
5:23
okay how long have you guys been here today and like how many Hang-Ups or or
5:29
like who haven't answered the phone have you had we've been here for about 2 hours and I think I've gone through like
5:35
160 calls and only one person finish the surve wow they were getting a lot of
5:42
answering machines or just people saying flat out no that's for reasons you'd
5:47
expect people generally don't have landlines anymore and they often don't answer unknown numbers the director of
5:54
Sienna's Research Institute says that 12 years ago callers might have asked average four completed surveys an hour
6:01
in National polls like these now the average is more like one completed
6:06
survey every 2 hours out of 182 calls so far today this is
6:12
my uh 112 answering machine 292 calls and then like five completed in the span
6:19
of it what are the secrets to being a great pole caller I think being patient
6:26
um and um I think you have to be friendly you know you are just a voice
6:32
and you know if you sound aggressive or you know BL bossy people hang up on you anyway but when they hear that they will
6:38
definitely hang up so I think it's just you know try to be as friendly with people and understanding and you know
6:45
try not to leave them you know so um I always say hello good evening um you
6:51
know hi my name is charlot I'm just and I always say their first name oh hi Tracy this is Charlotte I'm calling from
6:57
Siana College you know just not monotoned but you know sounding engaging
7:04
the beginning I was like do you have time for me to ask you a few questions and people would be like no so now I just go hi my name is Catherine so this
7:10
is the first question you just kind of go into it if you give them the choice they think I don't really want to do this and they put the phone down so I
7:17
used to have someone who worked here who' said nobody begged better than I did CU I would be like just talk to me just for a little while you know it's
7:23
been cool sometimes we feel like we're in Like the Wolf of Wall Street and there's like people speaking they're like and we're just like going at it and then it goes through dip it's really
7:29
quiet and everyone's not answering but it's really rewarding when someone answers it's so it's like you get so
7:36
many endorphins when it's like I don't know you hello thank you so much can you answer this question by the end of the
7:41
survey you feel like you've gone on this whole journey you're like thank you you made my whole night but you just have to keep it professional and be like yeah
7:47
cool thank so much for your cooperation but they so often you want to like talk back to them cuz they have like so much
7:52
to say but you can't like you go okay next question like
7:57
that's sometimes they like making jokes or they like yeah what do you think and you have to be like no no what do you think this is not about
8:04
me eventually Caitlyn did get the chance to listen to someone take the survey so
8:10
thinking ahead to next year's presidential general election are you almost certain that you will vote very likely that you will vote somewhat
8:16
likely not very likely or not at all likely I'm certain that I'll vote almost certain amazing thank you if the 2024
8:23
presidential election were held today who would you vote for if the candidates were Donald Trump the Republican or Joe
8:28
Biden the Democrat you're right thank you thinking generally about the criminal cases
8:34
against Trump which comes closer to your view even if neither is exactly right the charges against Donald Trump are
8:40
mostly politically motivated or Donald Trump was charged mostly because prosecutors believed he committed
8:46
crimes I mean they know he committed a crime he's already been charged okay so you would say charged
8:53
because prosecutors believed he committed crimes because he committed a crime he committed crimes perfect so
8:58
thinking about the investigations into Donald Trump do you think Donald Trump has when the poll results came out in
9:04
late December here were some of the headlines Trump was leading Biden 46% to
9:10
44% among registered voters but among likely voters Biden was leading Trump
9:17
47% to 45% also a majority of respondents had
9:22
an unfavorable view of both Trump and Biden and 62% of Republicans thought if
9:28
Trump won the Republican primary he should remain the party's nominee even if subsequently convicted of a crime and
9:36
all of this does help us understand the electorate but it doesn't answer the question of if and why you should trust
9:43
the polls and what the polling team is going to be trying to answer in the coming year so uh Nate I'm so glad we're
9:51
back how you doing well how are you good to see you it's good to see you too thank you for uh I got on the phone with
9:57
Nate con the time Chief political analyst who covers elections and polling
10:03
and I asked them how can we trust poll results when there are so many people
10:08
who just hang [Music] out well trust is a really interesting
10:15
word to use you know and look we work for the New York Times and the standard for what it means to trust our journalism is like super high right like
10:22
we present ourselves as providing something like an objective truth to readers true facts and the the truth is
10:29
polling is does not reach that standard and it never has even when response rates were very high polls are random
10:36
samples they're fuzzy statistics that are deeply imperfect and subject to all
10:42
different kinds of error and so if your standard for what it means to trust a poll is what it like usually means to
10:48
trust New York Times journalism what it usually means to say you trust something you can really count on it to be right
10:54
like the frustrating answer is you cannot trust polling Yeah by that standard right what you can do though I
11:00
think is learn quite a bit and you can learn quite a bit from polling even though it's deeply imperfect you even to
11:07
take the recent elections you know as bad as polls were in 2020 and 2016 the
11:12
national polls were only off by three and a half points in 2020 and two points in 2016 now you know in an era of close
11:20
elections three and a half and two points is like a lot it's the difference between Victory and defeat or in 2020s
11:26
case between a landslide and a fairly close race but it gets you in the ballpark for a
11:31
lot of things like you know for Biden's approval rating whether he's at 37 or 40 and a half% three and a half Point
11:38
difference is it really a huge difference for our understanding of the country probably not you know so I think
11:44
that there's a lot we can get from polling even stipulating that it's as imperfect as it is and even as imperfect
11:50
as it's been to earn the reputation of being outright badh now I think that it's still fair to ask like how do we
11:55
even know it's in the ballpark when response rates are this low how do we reach voters in an era when people
12:01
scream their calls myself included if it's from an unknown number I I haven't taken a poll in in years I last time I
12:09
took a poll was in like 2008 over summer in college because I had nothing to do pacing around in my you know my old
12:15
childhood bedroom it was about the Bill Gates Foundation anyway I think these are these are I love that you
12:21
remembering the last time the exact I was trying to think if I've been in the PO the only time I've ever done it anyway it's these are legitimate
12:27
questions and and we have a mix of evidence that tells us that this stuff is still useful some of it's based on
12:34
like hard research like you know in 2022 we did this really expensive study of Wisconsin where we mailed voters
12:41
Financial incentives to take a PLL and got 30% of people to take that survey and ran a telephone phone poll in
12:47
parallel that had a 1% response rate and the answers were basically the same so the difference is between this group of
12:53
people who takes a telephone poll and the broader population may not be that great and then on an individual poll by
12:59
poll basis you know we can scrutinize the poll based on the handful of facts that we do have does it have the right
13:05
number of Democrats or Republicans by party registration does it have the right number of young people and old
13:10
people does it have the right number of you know white voters or black voters and so on and those characteristics help
13:16
give us confidence as well none of it adds up to being perfect none of it adds up to being objective fact but like it
13:22
does add up to being useful MH right if we are talking about why are we still
13:28
find useful there's number of examples both in the past and in the present that give us a good example I mean if I
13:34
remember correctly yall's 2022 polling was pretty accurate reflection of the midterm results right it was I mean we
13:41
were on average I think off by less than two points across the 13 different races that we pulled not perfect but believe
13:48
it or not it's actually the best result of all time by any poster with more than
13:54
10 poles in a cycle hey I like it I like it but even that's perfect you know even
13:59
that like if I told you beforehand we were within two points I think a lot of you would be like okay two points not bad not perfect but like not bad and
14:06
there are a lot of purposes for which that'll be really great and there are others like if this is a super close presidential election where two points
14:11
will tell you nothing more than that it's close well in that reality what do you then see as the value add to the
14:19
polling that the New York Times and these other institutions are going to engage it I think the basic thing that
14:25
polling tries to do in a Democratic Society is
14:30
tell all kinds of political actors and I'm defining that super broadly to involve just like ordinary voters of
14:36
course but also sometimes literally politicians you know where the public is at on the issues and the candidates and
14:42
that information winds up cycling into the Democratic process in all sorts of ways because the democracy is supposed
14:48
to you know respond um to the will of the people in all kinds of contexts and some of those contexts are um like super
14:55
specific like does Joe Biden need need to change his stance on Israel and
15:02
Palestine in order to appeal young voters and like there are going to be people who are in the Biden campaign and
15:10
Democrats across the country who are going to have to make a strategic decision basically about um how to
15:16
balance their own personal views on the issues against the sort of tactical or strategic imperatives for a campaign
15:23
polling is like the number one way that those calculations sort of get made and it's true for um someone whether they're
15:29
deciding whether to put an initiative on the ballot which kind of primary candidate they're going to vote for which candidates they should give money
15:35
to what messages a campaign should have and sometimes What policies they should support and polling doesn't need to know
15:41
in many cases whether Biden is up two or tied or down to for that purpose right
15:47
um a lot of those answers can be you know resolved with the fuzzy statistics that we have to take Israel Palestine
15:53
among young voters like B's disapproval rating among young voters on this issue is like well over 70 % in most polls
16:00
maybe it's off by Five Points maybe it's 70 maybe it's 80 either way we know what
16:05
we need to know and um you know whether you like polling playing that role or not and I can think of a lot of
16:11
different reasons why polling is an imperfect fit for that that's the way
16:16
democracy works when we have competitive elections in order to decide the exercise of political power yeah I mean
16:22
you know so many campaigns will say oh we're not worried about the polls but I think we and you both know I mean they
16:28
do they wor they worry abouts massively they think about them all the time it shapes decisions to your point but it
16:35
also just shapes narratives too and I think we shouldn't leave media outside of this also polling is a Big Driver of
16:41
the coverage definely so you have this both yearning incentive for polling both from political junkies or Media or
16:48
candidates and you also have this growing skepticism I think among regular people who really just I think have
16:54
become increasingly skeptical that polling is a value or useful specifically when it comes to looking
17:00
for the result how do you balance that kind of Hunger for More polling more numbers a reaction to kind of every
17:07
piece of new information and what does seem to be the kind of Baseline growing skepticism among regular folks I mean
17:14
one interesting thing that's just worth flagging here is like I really don't like predict election results you know I
17:19
know people think of polling as being a way to predict elections which it totally is but like we're just taking
17:26
you know a measure of the public and it's never been precise as I mentioned and the polls can always be wrong and
17:34
what I try and do is have articles and takeaways that you know reflect those two facts we're always going to you know
17:41
talk as much as we can about the limitations of the polling and how it could be wrong and the cycle will be no
17:46
exception we haven't gotten like close enough to the heart of the race for us to write all the things about why the polls could be wrong yet um even though
17:52
we're already sort of prematurely in the heart of the polling season because the candidates are decided earlier than usual and so on but
17:59
uh that's all we can really do is be as honest about it as we can be yeah well let me ask you a couple more kind of polling logistic you know tactical
18:06
questions and then we'll get to the race itself with Trump on the ballot does that change any way that you all have to
18:11
go about polling that's a really good question I think the short answer is no like I
18:16
don't think the fundamentals of what we're doing change my concern is that it
18:21
may make our lives more challenging I think I'm concerned that Donald Trump has appealed to many of the kinds of
18:27
Voters who are least to participate in surveys like people who are disengaged and disaffected from
18:34
American politics people who distrust the media I the reason it doesn't change
18:40
how we pull is because we are always trying to adjust for all three of those things right we're always trying to make sure we have a representative sample
18:48
including in many cases along precisely the dimensions of potential bias that Trump has sort of exacerbated
18:55
potentially in his time in public life so I guess what I would say is like it doesn't change how we pull but it like I
19:02
think it does increase like the risks to polling I mean there's no way around the fact that the two worst elections that
19:10
polling has had in you know our lifetimes were with Trump on the ballot
19:16
and that he happens to appeal to many of the kinds of people who are less likely to take polls and that is a risk that we
19:22
have heading into this election now Trump's heading the polls right now so maybe that means that those factors are
19:28
less acute at the moment maybe it means that Trump's actually up even more than the PLL show right now I don't know yeah but it's definitely a risk does that
19:34
like worry you does that like keep you up in or is it just the reality of what y'all are facing of course it worries us
19:39
you know unlike a one of the funny things is that not only are the polls not like objective facts by the standard
19:46
of ordinary New York Times journalism we talked about there's also a scoreboard at the end yeah and um the things that
19:52
mess up the polls in elections are always different like even if we perfectly accounted for the things that went wrong in the last election
19:58
something new could do it this time just take an example if Trump gets convicted of a crime like am I concerned that a
20:04
lot of Republican voters are going to start saying they're undecided or voting for a third party candidate in the polls
20:09
and once they get into The Ballot Box vote for Donald Trump yeah I'm worried about that that could happen there are all kinds of things that can happen and
20:14
those are earnest things that can happen that's not like polling missing something that's a reality of how people go through these type of decisions and
20:21
so I I understand and I kind of you know I feel for the reality of that what you all have to face to that point we want
20:27
to talk about some of the findings that you all have had and just lay out kind of the state of the race for us as we
20:32
kind of transition to this new period I wanted to start though with one question about the Democratic and Republican
20:37
primaries respectively on the Republican side starting with Nikki Haley when we last talked last year you said that
20:44
there was just no Universe in which you thought a Haley versus Trump one-on-one matchup would end with anyone other than
20:51
Trump obviously we have arrived to this point now is there anything evidence you've had that would change that
20:57
opinion no I mean we could I don't want to go
21:02
and say oh I was right or something but like yeah there's I mean it's not going to happen you know even if Nikki Haley wins like Vermont or something you know
21:09
this isn't this isn't going to happen it's her you know this her appeal is too narrow and it's the this is a populist
21:15
conservative party and she's running a moderate establishment friendly candidacy it's it's just doesn't line up
21:22
yeah yeah I mean it's really helpful that like the clarity is still there because throughout the whole year obviously folks are going up and down
21:29
and I was like I don't know it seems to be a math issue yeah I'm going to ask about the Democratic side though also
21:35
Biden is himself cruising to the Democratic nomination he beat Dean Phillips handily with the rting campaign in New Hampshire he just got a huge
21:42
percentage of the vote out in South Carolina and one of the questions I've heard from people is how are we supposed
21:47
to take those primary results and fit them into the general election picture that we're seeing does the fact that
21:52
he's beaten the person who's making the age argument in New Hampshire mean he doesn't have a problem with age does the
21:58
fact that he got a big percentage with black voters in South Carolina means he doesn't have a potential problem with
22:04
black voters in the general how are we supposed to put the New Hampshire and South Carolina Democratic results in
22:10
perspective I mean to be blunt I think it's basically irrelevant and there are two reasons for I mean one this wasn't a
22:15
competitive race the turnout was extremely small it's just not reflective of even the normal presidential primary
22:21
elector I mean to take South Carolina the turnout for this presidential primary was lower than the 2022 to
22:28
Senate primary I mean can you can anyone here name I mean if you can name who was on the ballot in that contest to face
22:34
what that was to face Tim Scott in the general and people showed up for that in greater numbers than this that tells you
22:40
a lot about whether you're really tapping in to the sort of real
22:46
electorate um but it's really one of the big dividing lines in our polling over the last year that the sort of Democrats
22:52
who regularly participate in elections who have ideologically consistent views on the issues are sticking with Joe
22:58
Biden and the Democrats who don't regularly participate in elections are a big problem for him right
23:08
now more after the [Music]
23:19
break so it seems like we're okay then to look ahead to the general election I want to make sure that you agree with
23:25
that but but I also good that you agree with that but I guess because these are
23:32
two candidates that seem most familiar tell me like what do the data sets already tell us about Trump versus Biden
23:38
part two in a way that we wouldn't have had that much information about two candidates from the start at this point what there's some things that we
23:45
know almost everyone knows these two candidates and we've literally already had an election with them so we know a
23:51
lot about the Contours of this race I mean first the big thing that's changed since 2020 though is that Joe Biden has
23:57
gone from being popular to not popular uh you know back in 2020 50 plus% of
24:03
Americans said they had a favorable view of Joe Biden and now about 42% do and that is a pretty big change in the basic
24:10
Contours of the race you know in 2020 uh Joe Biden ran as the sort of broadly appealing and acceptable candidate who
24:15
could win all of the people of which there were many who didn't want Donald Trump to be president and instead we now have an
24:23
election where there's a large group of Voters who don't like either candidate and the polling says that this group of
24:28
Voters who has soured on Joe Biden over the last few years is disproportionately young black Latino
24:35
and less likely to be regular voters in elections MH it's a very simple story in
24:41
a way to have this like group of Voters go from liking Joe Biden to not they don't like Donald Trump still though
24:47
some of them are now willing to say that they'll vote for him at least in a poll nine months out whether that holds up
24:53
we'll see but it like actually sets up a fairly simple Nexus question from the standpoint of the polling which is what
24:58
happens over the next 9 months to this group of Voters who liked Joe Biden or at least accepted Joe Biden last time
25:05
and now doesn't and is currently registering their dissatisfaction with Joe Biden by either refusing to vote for
25:11
him in a poll or even outright being willing to support Donald Trump I mean it does feel to me that Trump 2024 is
25:18
much more focused on winning over black and Latino voters is much more focused on like young voters and it sees that
25:25
drop off of Biden as a way to kind of pull back a little more of a multicultural working class set of the
25:33
electorate than they had the ability to or even seem to be focused to do in 2016
25:38
or 20 like is that a is there any thing in the numbers that reflects that because that's my sense of their
25:43
political strategy and intention I think you're definitely right about the strategy I think the numbers only offer
25:50
equivocal support for the idea that Trump's actually improved his own popularity among these groups there's a
25:56
little bit of positive movement for Trump favorability wise since 2020 among the demographic groups that we're
26:02
talking about just how seriously to take that you know nine months from the election among precisely the kind of
26:08
Voters who aren't paying that much attention yet like sort of by definition I just don't know right that's what we
26:14
should track over the next several months that's exactly what we're going to track and you know I I have to be
26:20
honest this is not one of the most interesting general elections that I feel like I have covered before like we've literally done this already
26:26
literally um and it's we're watching sort of weaker versions of these
26:31
candidates coming back it's going to be a little bit painful for everyone including the voters and I think that
26:37
the problem that that will create is that because the overwhelming sense of Voters will be to register their
26:42
dissatisfaction with their choice that it may be difficult for us to detect whatever positive changes have sort of
26:49
occurred and I do think it's conceivable that there will be real positive changes for Trump that we're just going to sort of Miss here like to take one example
26:56
the 2016 campaign like was sort of defined by Donald Trump saying you know
27:01
racist things about immigrants and Mexicans and so on and that's not so far the way he's campaigned in 2024 but I
27:07
don't feel like we have a poll question that will neatly pick up that that thing that was hurting before isn't hurting him these people still don't like him in
27:12
a lot of cases so what do you right you know to the extent he's doing better he's gone from being like unacceptably
27:19
horrible to just like we still don't like him and still wish he wasn't around but maybe we can vote for him now and that's a hard thing to pick up for us
27:25
yeah I mean what you lay out has a lot of threads that are important for us to look forward and follow up on kind of
27:31
journalistically but more than anything you describe a type of person that's really familiar to the type of people we
27:36
talk to on the road people who may not know exactly about policies people who are shocked to learn that Biden versus
27:42
Trump would even be uh it is shocking In fairness to them they were shocked and
27:48
so it's much more of a hodge podge and particularly for the P type of people who are going to most matter for this
27:53
election it's not really clear like if there is a single Silver Bullet policy thing that's the answer here oh yeah so
28:01
just to entirely agree with you on your first point I mean once you start getting into the voters who don't turn out in midterms and only turn out in
28:07
generals or maybe sometimes don't vote in presidential elections that voter just Bears no resemblance yeah to you
28:16
dear listener like you know if you care enough to be listening to the show you are not the voter we're talking about um
28:22
and then to your second point about policy I mean I think that's one of the most interesting things about the
28:28
challenge that may or may not face Joe Biden going forward you know Joe Biden wants to win this election mostly on a
28:35
set of like serious issues like abortion and democracy you know and clearly those
28:43
issues resonate among the partisan and ideological voters who turn out in midterms and primaries and it remains to
28:51
be seen I think whether that's the best way to reach the kind of Voters that we're talking about right now it may be
28:56
that it is maybe that once they tune in and they hear these arguments they will be just as receptive to it as everyone
29:02
else but it's also possible that these voters are disengage precisely because those aren't the kinds of issues that they care about and that if they were
29:09
the kind of person that cares about abortion they would have voted last November to take an example it maybe that those voters care much more about
29:15
the superficial stuff where maybe Joe Biden has some serious problems like just the perception of whether he's capable of handling the job given his
29:21
age yeah the perception that the economy isn't doing well that prices are still
29:26
high that the of housing is higher that all of this creates just this backdrop of dissatisfaction and maybe that'll
29:32
fade or maybe not but it makes perfect sense to me that this group of people is
29:37
potentially being driven by an entirely different set of ideas and sentiments
29:43
and so on than the higher TR out electorate I've seen you write about the distinction between likely and
29:49
registered voters that was showing up in some polling does that distinction in the data speak to any of what we're
29:54
talking about here and how might that matter for for Biden in November yeah I mean right now as I've just mentioned
30:00
Biden is weak among these voters who don't regularly vote in elections right it's worth noting it's not simply that
30:07
he's holding his own among higher turnout voters he's actually looking better than 2020 among the highest
30:13
turnout voters like there are Republican voters out there and independents who voted for Donald Trump last time but who
30:20
are upset about abortion and upset about democracy and they're just like no I'm not doing Trump again after January 6
30:25
you see these people in New Hampshire turning out for Nikki Haley so at the top of the electorate these most likely
30:31
voters Joe Biden is probably doing better than he was four years ago at least in our data and so when we look
30:36
forward to November and we narrow ourselves to this narrower pool of Voters We Believe will turn out in the
30:42
general election as compared to the broader group of registered voters that group is ever so slightly better for
30:48
Biden because you've lost some of these dissenting low turnout voters and those High turnout voters that are Biden's
30:53
strength represent a greater proportion of the 2020 General electorate now oddly
30:59
enough if Biden winds up recovering among low turnout young black and Latino voters then the difference between the
31:06
likely voter polls and the registered voter polls May shrink a little bit right but for now with Biden's weakness
31:11
concentrated among less likely voters he might be doing better among the actual voting electorate of likely voters or
31:18
the likely electorate of likely voters than among the group of registered voters who you see in most polls right
31:23
now that's an interesting point it also kind of strikes though at the Democratic
31:29
I think language that you know small D democracy more people voting possible is
31:34
better for them I mean some what you're just describing is that the farther this electorate expands out might include
31:41
more people who are dissatisfied with bid it yeah I mean at least right now the issues that seem to
31:47
really alarm voters and determine whether someone is going to walk on glass in order to get to the polls those
31:54
are issues like democracy abortion and opposition to Trump that drives Biden's strength among this High turnout group
32:00
of Voters that he can really count on and as a consequence the smaller the
32:05
electorate is and the more you narrow down to the people who are willing to walk on glass the better Biden is doing
32:10
and so you're right that right now Democrats may do worse if hypothetically everyone voted which is unusual it's
32:16
certainly not what was true 10 years ago I don't even think it was true four years ago but at least right now with
32:22
this combination of democratic strength and on the highest turnout voters and weak on the lowest turnout voters I I think you're right that there's a chance
32:28
that that Biden would do worse if everyone voted MH you know you mentioned a couple walk- on glass issues abortion
32:34
democracy protection I wanted to say what are the other top issues you see is worth focusing on and most curious about
32:40
I'm thinking about Trump's legal cases or you know you mentioned the kind of economic indicators what are some of the
32:47
things that we should be most focused on outside of issues of abortion or democracy um you just mentioned two good
32:54
ones the economy obviously important especially to voters who are less
32:59
concerned about you know ideological issues who maybe precisely the voters
33:04
who Biden is weak among right now um you know the trials of Donald Trump that's
33:11
potentially a huge issue I mean the range of possibilities goes all the way from him being acquitted to being in
33:16
jail potentially right I mean that's a and we have no idea what kind of effect any of that we'll have it would not
33:22
surprise me if a conviction is enough to deter a sliver of Voters from supporting him in general election and that could
33:28
easily be decisive in a close race I'd put what's going on in the Middle East on this list as well you know we talked
33:34
about um Biden being weak among a disproportionately young and non-white group and that's also a group that um is
33:41
likel as to oppose Biden's support for Israel's conduct in Gaza and the West
33:47
Bank so that's reinforcing his weakness and in some cases maybe turning a weakness into a serious electoral
33:55
problem among perhaps a special Muslim and Arab voters or perhaps just the most far-left voters who now see Biden as
34:01
complicit in genocide potentially you know those are big words like if you really believe that this is complicity and genocide it should be no surprise to
34:08
think that that voter might not be willing to vote for Biden anymore if you really take them at at their word on that right so that's potentially a very
34:14
serious issue given that Biden may already be weak among the groups in question it's worth talking about the
34:20
issues that are favorable to Republicans too immigration in the Border a huge one yeah I was going to mention I'm sure immigration's driving the other side you
34:27
know I think that it's it's going to be really interesting to see how that plays out including what's going on um the
34:32
hill right now like I'm not even sure how Biden was supposed to defend himself on this issue as of a month ago like if
34:38
he was talking to a skeptical voter On the Border I'm not even sure what he was supposed to say to reassure them given
34:45
the way that they've handled it to this point both from a policy and a messaging standpoint I just felt like they didn't
34:50
have anything that they could say that they were saying to defend themselves now they have this interesting
34:56
opportunity to run against Republican obstruction on the border and that'll be an interesting change to like the
35:02
rhetorical landscape here um and I think Joe Biden's age also has to be mentioned here it's in some ways it's the most
35:10
obvious issue you know the guy is over 80 years old voters overwhelmingly say
35:15
he's too old to be president we've never had someone this old running for office
35:21
and who so many people say is too old to be president is that really the core of
35:27
all of these problems that Joe Biden has it's possible as we tick off these issues one by one as the economy gets
35:33
better as the immigration deal maybe helps his position on that issue if we're still looking at Trump in the lead
35:38
at that point that's going to be the one where it's like maybe this is a horse who can't win the horse race because
35:44
he's too old now maybe it's not a message problem it's a messenger problem we may come to that point if everything
35:50
keeps breaking well and Biden continues to Trail and that's also one that just it's so unusual and different from what
35:55
we've seen before that it it could be extremely important and it's just hard to predict whether
36:02
that's the sort of thing voters can or can't accept you know one last question
36:07
I have is the thing I'm really obsessed with this year is the issue of voter apathy with so many people who don't
36:14
want either of the two options being Trump or Biden what are they going to do are they going to vote for a third party
36:20
are they going to not vote at all do people just begrudgingly back one of those two candidates is there some way
36:25
one of those candidates can make make thems newly appeal to someone I guess I wanted to pose that to you like how
36:31
would you look to track the question of apathy and disengagement or engagement
36:38
in this year's election and do you think that that apathy is really the right word to track what we've seen in polling
36:44
as that candidate distaste yeah I don't think of it as apathy exactly I do think
36:49
of it more as distaste as you put at the end there or dissatisfaction I mean you can be a highly engaged voter who does
36:59
not want either of these candidates and based on the polling there are a lot of Voters who don't want either of these
37:05
candidates and the thing about the phrase voter apathy is it makes it sound like it's about the voters not caring
37:11
rather than about like the system providing choices that are deeply unpalatable to a large segment of
37:16
Americans right and I do think that what you know that is probably more of what we're seeing right now and you're
37:22
totally right that you know how much support third parties get in this election is going to be a huge potentially I mean we're we're sort of
37:28
all avoiding this huge elephant in the room with RFK Jr because we don't know
37:33
if he's going to be on the ballot yet but if the polls are right he would probably start over 10% um and you know maybe he'll lose all
37:41
that support as the stakes become clear but that measure alone is such a tell indication of how many voters are
37:49
dissatisfied with the traditional choices right now uh we also have the question of whether voters dislike like
37:56
both candidates I think that the double haters as people like to refer to them as colloquially I think that's a fun group to hone in on are these people
38:04
actually going to vote do they say they're going to vote are they voting for RFK are they undecided that group of
38:10
Voters who don't like both candidates I think is a really important one but like the thing about voting in a presidential
38:15
election is like with all of the early voting and all the absentee voting and all the media attention like if you
38:21
really care about the election you end up voting there are undoubtedly some people who don't vote
38:27
who wanted to vote but it's it's a small number of people in these sort of Elections compared to others and the
38:33
thing that determines turnout is whether you care enough to vote whether there's someone who you want to get up and and you know go to the polls for or not and
38:42
that'll be the question um as far as turna is concerned is whether people are sufficiently motivated either by their
38:48
love for one of the candidates or if not the depth of their hatred for the other right I phrased it as apathy but I
38:54
think distaste is really right because that is really what we're up against like an election where voters are very
39:00
clearly stating this isn't what they wanted but this is the reality yeah and
39:08
we had an election like this before in 2016 and it was a more volatile cycle um
39:13
there were huge numbers of undecided voters Gary Johnson for a time you may remember was pulling in the high single digits um there are people who think
39:20
that the minor party vote even decided that election um and it's certainly a possibility that something like that
39:26
could happen again well to the craziness ahead
39:32
like between you know between the work that you're doing the work that we're doing like it's going to be I I is it
39:39
going to be's the word you going to say fun is that the word yeah I was going to say fun and then I almost stopped myself will it you tell
39:45
me uh honestly I I I don't think it's going to be fun not
39:51
necessarily we are very lucky I think to have the jobs that we have but it's and
39:56
there's a lot about our jobs that's tons of fun but look the substance of this election is it's literally an election
40:02
we've had before except we have sort of worse versions of the candidates coming back and it's all against the backdrop
40:08
of extremely you know dire and serious Stakes thank you thank you

40:52
the overwhelming winner of the primary was the option that read none of the these candidates which received over 63%
40:59
of the votes the outcome in Nevada is now Haley's thirdd consecutive loss in an early State primary contest still her
