Joe Bidenâ€™s Challenge With Gen Z Voters


0:00
[Music] in a close election every vote matters but in the 2020 presidential race
0:07
there's a good argument that one group mattered more than others young
0:13
voters youth turnout increased 11 percentage points from 2016 to
0:19
2020 and according to Pew research voters age 18 to 29 prefer Biden by 24
0:26
percentage points but this year things seem much less
0:33
straightforward polling data shows President Biden's approval rating has tanked among Young
0:38
Americans polls also show that he continues to be hounded by the perception that he's too old for the
0:45
job and young activists are creating a public relations nightmare for the campaign whether it's protest for more
0:52
direct action on climate change or demanding a permanent ceasefire in
0:58
Gaza so and a general election matchup of familiar elderly candidates what can
1:05
we learn about a critical demographic that's often talked about but less
1:11
frequently spoken to the kids from The New York Times I'm estad
1:17
hearnen this is the [Music] runup understanding young voters can be
1:24
hard to do in a lot of polls the sample size of younger Americans like millennials in gen Z is too small to
1:32
draw big conclusions so when I heard that NextGen America one of the country's largest
1:37
Democratic groups dedicated to young voters was doing a new comprehensive look at the political attitudes of
1:44
Americans aged 18 to35 I knew I wanted to talk with the head of the group Christina CSUN Ramirez
1:52
about the findings you know we wanted to talk to you because outside of the work you all do generally nextg just
1:58
completed the poll f focused on the November election and specifically measuring the attitudes of young voters headed into it can you tell me about who
2:06
participated in the poll what drove you all to do it and what were the biggest questions you were seeking for it to answer well for us as an organization we
2:14
target young people ages 18 to 35 this is a huge generational voting block it
2:19
is a voting block that votes overwhelmingly Progressive but a lot of polls don't pick up on the nuances that
2:24
exist with young people so uh for example in any poll you see with young people you're going to see that young
2:30
people have questions and concerns with the two- party system you're going to see that a lot of young people see
2:36
themselves as Independents even though they are overwhelmingly choosing the Democratic party to vote for and remake
2:43
the vision of the country that they want to inherent and so this poll lets us dig in and figure out amongst those 18 to 35
2:50
year olds who do we need to Target and focus on to get them to turn out and defeat Donald Trump and elect Joe Biden
2:58
yeah so I mean one I appreciate you including 30 to 35 in the young people range I guess you're you're you're
3:04
classified in there aesthetically as a young voter we had a team discussion today about what we should take as young
3:09
people to mean but I am just going to take the next gen definition which includes me also I mean you are right
3:16
that when we look at the polling sample numbers of 18 to 35 year olds you don't get the nuances between them you saying
3:21
you all did this right now to know where the trouble spots are for Democrats and how you can fix them 6 months out from
3:28
the election that's right the trouble spots the opportunities where do we need to focus our resources on this big
3:34
cohort to turn them out because Joe Biden got elected in 2020 in huge part
3:40
because of young people and I want to remind people Joe Biden was not the youth V candidate of 2020 that was
3:45
Bernie Sanders the older other white guy yeah well let's get into some of the Topline numbers from you all's recent
3:51
poll what did the numers say about Biden versus Trump in a two candidate matchup versus what did they say in Biden versus
3:58
Trump when you include third parties I mean I think what we saw from our poll is that young people have questions and
4:04
concerns about both candidates we saw that in a two-party matchup or a two
4:09
candidate matchup that Biden defeats Donald Trump by 12 points okay if you
4:15
add in third party choices that shrinks to nine points and we saw that 20% of
4:21
young people that we surveyed said they were considering voting for a third party candidate so those and RFK taking
4:29
the big chunk of that portion we're seeing RFK spend a lot of money on Tik Tok and focusing and targeting young
4:34
people right now okay so with the 101 match up with Biden versus Trump Biden's ahead by 12 points in a one-on-one
4:41
versus third party matchup you have Biden's lead among young people shrink down to nine points how should we
4:47
understand that especially in the context of what happened back in 2020 with the same matchup I was looking at Pew analysis earlier today that said if
4:54
we look around the same age group cohort Biden won that group by nearly 24 points in 2020 so what do we think is driving
5:03
that 10 15% drop off to the numbers we're seeing now yeah there's a lot of
5:08
young people like I said that have concerns and questions and and to be clear in 2020 we spent a lot of
5:14
resources and time and energy reaching out to young people to convince them to vote for Joe Biden he was underwater
5:19
with young voters in 2020 certainly the folks that we targeted and reached out to and talked about the difference
5:25
between Biden and Trump we were able to see major gains so it's a very similar to that in 2020 but we have seen that
5:32
drop off but when you dig in and you ask young people especially with the youngest cohort these are new voters
5:38
they weren't around last election and they don't remember the record of Donald Trump because they are so young but let
5:44
me think back to four years ago when we think about 2020 and I think about what young people used to say about Biden
5:49
then it was often a sense that he was too old there was often a sense that he was maybe out of touch are you saying
5:55
those are the same reasons that are informing maybe the soft support we're seeing right now now or is it something
6:00
that's transpired in those four years you it is it is part that they never saw
6:05
him there's a a portion of the youth electorate that is concerned about Joe Biden's age right and they're more concerned about Joe Biden's age than
6:13
Donald Trump's age however they are more concerned about Donald Trump as a threat to democracy in the country than they
6:19
are about Joe Biden's age okay so I think when you ask young people what the
6:25
Biden Administration has done there is a disconnect right and what they've delivered on student debt on climate
6:31
legislation with the inflation reduction act on gun safety and when you're able to point that out to young people and
6:37
educate them they are willing to switch their vote and so that's where we see areas of opportunity for the Biden
6:43
Administration is pointing to Progressive policy the other thing you can obviously do is point to Donald
6:48
Trump's age because he's no young spring chicken himself and as an organization that cares about Progressive policy we
6:55
endorse Joe Biden because for us it doesn't matter if Donald Trump was 50 years younger his policies feel straight out of the
7:01
1950s for most young people so I hear what you're saying that while there are certainly some concerns about age that
7:07
we're true in 2020 and true now uh what you're mostly seeing is a what you're identifying as a knowledge gap between
7:14
what the Biden campaign has done in terms of tangel policy accomplishments and how that's translated to some young
7:20
folks I guess another question I would ask though is it does seem like a big difference between four years ago and
7:26
now is there has been an outcry about the administration's policy in terms of supporting Israel's actions in Gaza and
7:32
we have seen a lot of that activism driven by young people how much did that issue come up in the poll and should
7:39
that be seen as a factor that's contributing to Biden's at this point smaller than expected Advantage among
7:45
young folks yeah with we see a a huge number of young people saying they care
7:50
about foreign policy in this election compared to last election so in 2022
7:55
when you had the situation in Ukraine clearly at the Forefront of policy just 4% of young people said that foreign
8:03
policy was a top issue for them we've seen now 82% of young people 82% say
8:10
they see foreign policy as an important issue and you have close to 70% of young people displeased with the Biden
8:17
administration's position on uh Gaza and Palestine and its support of the Israeli government's efforts so it is clear that
8:24
in the polling that there is a frankly a backlash from young folks that it's coming because of the administ policy as
8:30
of now did your poll or focus group or research show any way that let's say the administration was to embrace a
8:37
permanent ceasefire or with the kind of new pressure that the administration is trying to put on the Israeli government
8:43
was there any evidence that that is enough or if that would speak to what some of these young folks are looking
8:49
for our poll showed two things right it showed that there's clear disapproval of the administration's handling but when
8:56
you get to what should be done in response they're divided in an alternative approach and so that becomes
9:02
the challenge for the administration now you still do have overwhelmingly Democrats and Progressive young people
9:10
wanting a ceasefire and restriction you have Independence amongst young people which is a pretty significant portion in
9:16
the middle on what should be done and so that's where I think the administration will struggle is figuring out the pathway forward but overwhelmingly if
9:23
the administration were to call for an overall ceasefire I think it would help speak better to the portion of the youth
9:29
electorate that is very concerned about this issue interesting another thing that stuck out when I was looking at the
9:34
trend lines of the poll was that it seemed as if some of these problems were super localized among 18 to 24 year olds
9:42
even more so than 24 to 35 what was it among this group specifically that you
9:49
think was driving them to be less Biden supportive than other cohorts you know
9:54
if you're 18 years old you were 10 years old when Donald Trump was elected and so
9:59
you know you 10 years old you probably had great parents that shielded you and didn't want you to hear the sounds of crying babies being ripped from their
10:05
mothers at the border the site of Heather hire being run over by white supremacists in Charlottesville those
10:11
were things your parents probably didn't want you to see or hear and so you may not know of that record a lot of young people in 2020 were driven to turn out
10:19
to defeat Donald Trump and the threat that they saw he posed and so for this cohort of younger people they need to be
10:26
educated about Donald Trump and the threat he poses to really motivate them and that's also what we saw from our
10:32
polling is that learning who Joe Biden is and his track record on Progressive policy is critical for them to learn but
10:39
more than anything learning about Donald Trump and his positions especially on issues like abortion will drive this
10:45
cohort to turn out and vote for Joe Biden interesting so the thing that most moved this cohort wasn't just saying
10:51
that Joe Biden here some good things Joe Biden's done from the progressive lens but even more than that was saying here
10:57
are some bad things Donald Trump has done the progressive land yeah here's Donald Trump you may have just read the
11:02
news and Donald Trump tried to say he's not for an abortion ban but little did you know that he was the president that
11:09
nominated the Supreme Court Justices to overturn row and took away the right of tens of millions of women to decide what
11:15
happened with their own body and their own health and so that's an important record to talk about especially when you talk about his attacks on abortion civil
11:24
and human rights that is a very big motivator for this generation you know we talked about this earlier but beyond
11:31
the candidates are there any specific issues that matter the most to this age cohort we saw within this cohort um
11:39
abortion being a top motivating issue obviously the economy and for us especially on the economic question
11:46
we'll get questions about you know the Biden administration's economic positions and how young people are
11:51
feeling about inflation and it's not a surprise that young people are feeling the pinch of inflation and the higher
11:57
cost of living and rent and housing this is the first generation to be worse off than their parents they have less
12:03
assets to be able to deal with um economic shifts but where we also have
12:08
seen the Biden Administration be able to improve its position with young people in the economy are their policy
12:14
positions so 88% of young people support labor unions now they want a living wage
12:20
instead of a minimum wage they want equal pay for women so if the Biden Administration leans on those policies
12:27
that clearly distinguish them from the Republican party that is how Democrats
12:32
and the Biden Administration can win the youth vote on the economy as well interesting I mean I guess I see how
12:38
that works in relationship to Donald Trump one question I have is I remember last year Biden supportive kind of DNC
12:46
type people telling me that the policy accomplishments will win the day and that we would see kind of movement in
12:52
polling fronts about people when they see that the policies have set in that hasn't really happened yet even when it
12:58
comes to climate and things like the IRA what is the gap between the actual actions of the administration and the
13:05
fact that some of that stuff hasn't really set in for the populations they're trying to Target yeah I think we have to understand that the ecosystem of
13:12
media and information has changed rapidly for especially young people you know as an organization for example we
13:19
have never spent a penny um and nor will we ever probably unless there's a big shift which I doubt it on a television
13:25
advertisement for example we have only worked with influencers and finding young people on social media we're going
13:31
to have thousands of organizers being on everything from Discord and gaming applications to even dating apps and
13:38
sliding into people's DMS the Biden campaign we've started to see them invest more in advertising on Tik Tok
13:43
and working with influencers that has to be really um mobilized at a greater
13:49
level because you can see the gains literally the gains that RFK is making right now as he starts to invest more
13:54
into advertising on Tik Tok and reaching young people with his message so we know
14:00
from our own polling that if they reach young people with the right messages and the right Messengers they're going to
14:05
start cutting into those numbers but they have to spend the time and money on it and do it as early as possible if Biden won
14:13
2020 driven by youth populations coming around him and if we know through the
14:19
work that you all do and the work that others have done that those positive messages can shift those voters why
14:26
haven't they happened yet what we've only had one election since Biden was
14:31
elected right which was 2022 and again if you went back and read the paper uh
14:37
the New York Times Washington Post whatever anything before the election of 2022 it was going to be headlines about
14:43
young voters depressed don't support Biden unlikely to turn out aren't favorable as much as they should be to
14:48
Democrats election happened young people turned out in record numbers for Democrats see I you are providing a
14:54
helpful reminder which is that let registering your distaste at this point is not the same as not voting it's not
15:01
the same as saying you're not going to participate at all and there is very much in Universe where young people uh
15:09
uh say all the things that they don't like about the administration's foreign policy or about Biden's age but then
15:14
still to the 3 weeks before the election uh identify the choice that you're kind of laying out here and end up backing
15:21
Democrats I guess I'm just asking isn't that a big bet oh instead it gives me uh
15:28
heart pilation every sing like that's reality but I know and our organization
15:34
knows from our 10e record of registering 1.5 million young people and targeting literally millions of young people each
15:41
election and trying to turn them out to vote that if you spend the time and money and effort connecting with young
15:46
people authentically around Progressive policy and then tell them about the candidate they will turn out and vote
15:53
Donald Trump was defeated in 2020 in huge part because of young people uh the
15:58
red wave that was supposed to happen and was promised to happen in 2022 did not happen because of young people we are in
16:05
a moment where young people are exercising their voting power at much greater numbers they are very politically aware this is also the most
16:11
Progressive generation in American history and I think it's fine for them to have questions concerns and demands
16:18
of the party that they're choosing the Democratic party they're not finished remaking the party to move it in the
16:24
direction they want to see and that's okay but it's clear they' they are choosing with their votes which party
16:31
they're putting their bet on is the party listening to them and what is the evidence that they are I think the party
16:37
is listening to them I don't think that in my opinion and my experience that you elect good people and they just do the
16:44
right thing I think you elect good people and then you push them to deliver on their campaign promises I don't think
16:50
the Biden Administration would have cancelled the level of student debt that it has had it not been for young people
16:56
organizing we don't get the inflation reduction Act the single largest investment by any
17:01
country on the planet without young people pushing and organizing we don't
17:06
get the office of gun safety um at the federal level without young people
17:12
pushing and organizing for it so yes the Biden Administration has been responsive
17:17
it's passed more Progressive policy than any elected official presidential
17:23
official in my lifetime um and now we have to make sure that it's so young people understand that we haven't gotten
17:29
everything we wanted but that's okay that's where we're going to elect Joe Biden and Camala Harris to give us four more years and win even more than we've
17:36
already won so again we don't get to all of the huge policy wins we've had for
17:43
Progressive policy if it were not for young people making this Administration nervous yeah you know you mentioned the
17:50
20% that said they're interested in third parties we started by talking about the direct Biden Trump matchup but
17:55
I also wanted to ask you how we should view this number is this 20% just looking for another
18:02
option well we saw that uh nearly half of that 20% that wanted to vote third
18:08
party was really soft that as soon as you started talking to them about the record of either candidate um they were
18:14
uh quick to be willing to change their vote okay so for us we're going to make sure that's a huge cohort that we're
18:20
talking to as well those people that are thinking of third party because they are double haters people that don't like
18:26
either candidate however again the majority of them voted for joee Biden in
18:31
2020 so that's a real Advantage for Joe Biden over Donald Trump do you have a specific goal in mind when it comes to
18:38
November is there a turnout Target is there a percentage of younger voters you want to support Biden or is the only
18:44
goal simply Biden's VI election regardless of the route to that goal I mean for us we are working as hard as we
18:51
can to make sure that we're hitting that 50% youth voter turnout mark this
18:56
election and we want to see 60% of them voting for Joe Biden okay so we're
19:02
saying move up that turnout a little bit and keep them about the same place when in terms the percentage of Voters would be the goal that next gen has it would
19:08
almost be on power for what we saw in 2020 okay even if Biden were to win
19:14
re-election doesn't some I don't like this even if go on I mean listen in the universe that
19:21
Joe Biden wins the election doesn't this still add to like a growing trend of a
19:26
rising generation that feels further and further further away from electoral politics and the party themselves like I
19:32
understand that you are an organization that has endorsed Biden that you want Biden to win but just separate from that
19:39
is the idea of nominating an 81y old president for reelection like with that reality is
19:44
there any chance the Democrats are doing long-term damage to their relationship with this next Generation even if he
19:50
does win in November I I just don't see it that way the way I see it is young people are
19:56
fighting for Progressive policy ons I also think it's a false reality when you
20:01
bring up that perspective given that the most popular youth folk candidate is even older which is Bernie Sanders so to
20:08
me it's about what does the Democratic party do as an institution and as and
20:14
candidates do to invite and welcome young people in and understand and I think they're doing a much better job if
20:20
we go back even to 2018 when AOC won her race the Democratic party was cringing
20:25
at some of the demands that young people and kind of the Progressive youthful arm that she was bringing into the party
20:31
were demanding and now instead they're sitting down with those organizations they're sitting down with those leaders
20:37
and we look at that at how much the party overall has moved on economic
20:43
issues it was a wild idea to say we were going to cancel student debt it was a wild idea to say the minimum wage should be $15 an hour it was a wild idea to say
20:51
we were going to really invest the full resources to tackle the climate crisis those are now Center to the Democratic
20:57
party and that's because of of young people and it's made our country better in my opinion the last question I and then we'll totally let you go is just to
21:03
give a specific answer to this voter I think about all the time there was an open discussion over Thanksgiving food
21:09
in November about whether a group of younger Democrats were going to back Biden in November now I remember one
21:14
person saying that she wasn't going to vote and then someone was trying to push her saying you know that just means that
21:20
someone else is going to win you're going to have no say and she was like that's the point I don't want it to be because of me because I don't like
21:26
either of those options what would your resp response to that sentiment be to the person who's sick of that lesser of
21:32
two evils argument I mean we know from our polling that when we talk
21:38
about very fundamental rights that have gone backwards 50 years because you sat
21:43
out an election or you choose not to vote um that that is what will motivate
21:49
folks to understand that if you want to have a the basic decision about when where and how you make a baby and when
21:55
you make a family or what happens with your health that your really matters I think when people see the tangible
22:01
difference and that's why abortion is so clear for so many young people that are of reproductive age that when the state
22:09
uh and religious zealots get involved in your decisions about what you decide with your F your body um it makes it
22:16
very clear what the consequences and circumstances are of sitting out an election thank you so much Christina I
22:23
really appreciate your time and for chatting with us thanks so much take care after the break we talked to young
22:30
voters themselves after hearing from Christina about this new nextg polling and the
22:37
reality of President Biden's vulnerabilities with younger voters we wanted to hear from some young people
22:44
directly so we called two people we knew were politically engaged who my colleagues had met at a climate protest
22:50
in New York City back in September hello hello can you hear me
22:58
yeah sorry I'm in I'm downtown so I'm just trying to find a slightly quieter
23:03
spot to hang out oh oh okay no problem well thank you for your time I
23:09
appreciate you picking up I mean can you just tell me uh a little bit about yourself first can you tell me your name
23:14
what part of the country you're from how old are you things like that yeah so my name is Eloise Navaro
23:20
where I go by L now e l um um I'm in Portland Oregon right now doing some
23:28
local climate organizing and I am 22 years old were you too young to vote in
23:34
2020 or were you able to vote in the 2020 election in the 2020 election I I
23:40
did vote I believe that was the first election I voted in okay and who did you vote for in
23:45
2020 in 2020 I did vote for President
23:50
Biden okay I guess one question I have is why did you vote for Biden in 2020
23:56
and do you expect to vote for Biden again in 202 24 I voted I honestly voted for Biden
24:04
pretty reluctantly and I did cast a vote for him you know and
24:09
under I I the philosophy I was using at the time was well it's not Trump you know we just went through four years of
24:15
trump and we can't do that again and so I didn't feel any particular Allegiance towards Biden but at the time I was like
24:22
well it's better than Trump so that's what motivated me to cast my vote and I
24:28
think at that time in 2020 perhaps I had a little bit more faith in the electoral system than I do now and so the question
24:36
of would I vote for Biden again in this upcoming election is absolutely not um
24:43
and I think I can't talk about Biden and his choices for climate and for social justice without mentioning um Palestine
24:51
and the ongoing genocide and how um I have no other way to describe it besides
24:58
cruel and atrocious um Biden's actions towards uh the international scene has
25:04
been so yeah I can confidently say that I will not be voting for Biden nor Trump
25:10
um in this upcoming election because if anything the past year or two has proved
25:15
that perhaps there isn't um as much of a divide between the Democratic and
25:21
Republic parties that um you know we we used to think that there was is this a
25:27
personal conviction for you or is this something you're telling others like as someone who does political activism is
25:34
it just that you're saying you'll no longer vote for Joe Biden are you encouraging others to not other young people to not vote for Joe
25:40
Biden I am encouraging other folks and I think I am certainly not the only one
25:46
who is I'm I'm sure that y'all have seen that there are active state level
25:51
campaigns to write in uncommitted or whatever makes sense for your I think what you're saying is a little different
25:57
because committed in the primary is a individual protest you're saying you're not going to vote for him in November
26:03
when the stakes even to your own kind of admission are quite real
26:10
right yeah yeah so I guess in that way yeah I feel comfortable saying that I would encourage folks not to vote yeah
26:16
in the November election or to not vote for Biden we know that the answer to that or the like political party
26:22
response to that will always be that you are foregoing a voice kind of in democracy and and uh making Donald Trump
26:30
more likely to be the winner someone who I think per your vote in 2020 you probably think is a worse president than
26:37
Joe Biden at the minimum so what's your response to that my response is that at this point
26:44
Biden has shown that he's not necessarily a better president than Trump in my opinion okay and so the
26:50
reason I'm saying no you know no to Biden is because I would rather Trump
26:56
win and then us probably experiened very similar um impacts negative impacts that
27:03
we had from the Biden Administration then let his administration know that in any way I approve of what he's done or
27:10
of what he's going to do I guess the way I see it for me is not Trump versus Biden it is people versus politics or
27:18
people versus Corporate entities and and bad faith politicians that's helpful to
27:24
understand is it also about teaching Democrats a lesson it feels like some of that in
27:29
there oh absolutely um I think you know honestly I I don't know what happens
27:35
behind closed doors with politicians um and I think perhaps there used to be a stronger divide between Republicans and
27:42
Democrats so I'm not sure how how other people would feel about that but now I think it's pointing out whether they
27:48
know it or not you are the same as Republicans and you are no better than them you seem 100% confident right now
27:56
are you 100% confident in your confidence you know like are you definitely going to do are do you think
28:02
you'll be in the same place come November um I I feel pretty confident um
28:08
and you know I could see some people shifting but really the the reason I'm confident is because I am so deeply
28:16
invested in community care and in community in general and so I can be
28:21
confident because I know that I have my people's back and my people have my back um so in a way it's a little bit
28:28
rebellious to say yeah absolutely come November I'm not going to give in um and
28:33
I'm lucky to say that because of the the relationships I formed and I strongly encourage other folks to be more deeply
28:41
rooted in community and divest a little bit from the electoral system and back
28:46
into the people that are right in front of them well thank you so much L I really appreciate your time and I really
28:51
think that this kind of explanation will be helpful for folks getting in the mind of the youths which we know is not
28:58
always easy for uh folks to do so thank you so much for taking some time out and chatting with us yeah um yeah of course
29:07
thank you thank you for the good
29:16
conversation hello hello hello can you hear me hi yes I can hear you hello I
29:22
was looking for Ellie yes that is me hi hi thank you so much for uh picking up I appreciate you
29:28
taking some time out to chat with us Ellie can you tell me a little bit about yourself can you tell me um uh what you
29:34
do how old you are uh what part of the country you're in things like that so I
29:39
am um I'll be 19 in two weeks um is that does that make you an
29:45
Aries I'm in Aries I'm a Taurus actually oh yikes we were about to bond but then it just end
29:52
it yeah um yeah so I'm a first year student right now at brenmar College um
30:00
which is outside of Philadelphia I've grown up in Pennsylvania for most of my
30:06
life are you someone who considers yourself a Democrat a republican has any kind of political
30:11
leaning um well I was definitely a democrat in the past I would consider myself pretty politically homeless I
30:18
certainly vote for the Democrats because of a two-party system but um I I'm I
30:24
would say uh economically very Progressive left I I'm also a a radical feminist so
30:32
that's in terms of a lot of social issues on feminism that puts me kind of pretty uh in a different different space
30:39
than a lot of uh people who maybe say they're liberals so I don't know if I would necessarily say I'm really um
30:45
really a liberal you know you met our colleagues back in September last year when you were in New York for the
30:50
climate March and we were interested in talking to young people about how they were thinking about the presidential
30:55
election in terms of a policy issue that was important to them specifically climate what were you thinking at that
31:01
time when it came to President Biden and how are you thinking uh about your vote in
31:06
November well I think back then I was really you know I I I can't remember if
31:13
I knew this or not then but I think at least what I remember is I was not expecting Biden to run again actually I
31:19
was thinking that logically you know he's he's old he was going to step down and I was kind of I was prepared to get
31:26
hyped for primaries and try to you know find a reasonable candidate to to try to
31:31
put in office um since then the fact that we have now uh literally the same
31:38
choices as back in 2020 is incredibly disheartening I did get a an like a
31:44
ballot um a mail and ballot for the primaries but I'm actually not sure I'm even going to go through the trouble of
31:50
using it because what is the point the incumbent's running nobody's running against him um if I actually because
31:57
it's p and you can't vote as an independent primaries I if there was any
32:03
um like competition with the Republican primaries I would have registered as a Republican and voted for somebody who's
32:10
not Trump uh to try to to get a different uh a different opposition to
32:15
the Democrats but that was also not a choice so here we are I mean it's not
32:21
that I'm not going to vote in November I certainly I certainly will be voting for Biden in November um because I do think
32:27
it's important to choose the lesser of two evils when you talk to young people your age cohort about this election what
32:35
is the overall feeling are they like you were they you know maybe are disappointed but probably going to vote
32:40
for Biden in the end or are you talking to people uh other people we talked to even including at that climate March who
32:46
say they're actually encouraging people to not back Biden in November what what wins
32:52
out um I think but you know right now we're not I feel like we're not quite
32:58
close enough to it because there's no competition of the primaries I don't think we're really at a point where most
33:03
people are talking that much about the election I think my sense is at least the people that I'm around will
33:10
absolutely vote for Biden because of the Lesser two evils argument I personally
33:15
have very little Sympathy for the idea that like you know some moral perfectionism that like it's better to
33:22
just vote for nobody because in my opinion that means that you are accepting the fact that either party win
33:28
and that you think they're somehow equally bad which I think is is a very naive opinion um I I I do know that
33:36
there are people who are kind of um very purists and want to only vote for
33:43
somebody they are feel really in line with um I get the sense that that is not most people I think most people my age
33:49
in the end will be reasonable and will end up voting for Biden if that is the
33:55
Democratic Choice well thank you so much I appreciate your time and thank you so much for like letting us pick your brain
34:02
a little all right thank you so much while Ellie and L represent one
34:08
perspective not every young person is deeply engaged in politics and many have priorities
34:15
outside of climate change and foreign policy in fact when we talk to 18 to
34:21
35-year olds who recently participated in New York Times polling this range was
34:26
well represented
34:32
this is Kelvin we heard interest in third party candidates um I think the only one
34:39
that's really CAU my is uh I believe Corell West has
34:44
announce some interest in Donald Trump how are you thinking about this year's election and did you vote in the
34:50
Republican primary this year uh not in the Republican primary I did vote in the last
34:56
election mhm in 2020 who did you vote for then uh the Republicans you voted for the
35:02
Republicans I imagine that includes Donald Trump at the top of the ticket yep absolutely you know this was a unique
35:09
time because we're very likely to have these two candidates again are you thinking about voting for Donald Trump again absolutely yeah and we heard a
35:16
general sense of disappointment in both major party
35:23
candidates hello hi my name is estad hearon I'm a reporter with the New York Times I was looking for
35:28
Sean uh yeah that's me even among young people who supported Biden's re-election
35:34
I you know I I got my degrees in history and political science I work for the government um I'm very invested in
35:41
politics despite the fact that I can't really openly campaign for anyone because I'm I'm a I'm a nonpartisan
35:47
government employee um and I take my job very seriously I work for the Civil Rights division um
35:54
and most concerning to me is is that um more voters are under more young voters
35:59
are undecided now they're up for grabs and I think yeah and and and
36:07
particularly young people of color which which concerns me um if you traffic any of the internet uh
36:16
any of these like more more conservative spaces on the internet now there is a uh
36:21
pretty intentional targeting towards young black voters um especially right
36:26
but one thing they agreed on Biden 2024 feels different than Biden 2020 I think
36:33
my biggest frustration has been that the White House in the DNC have not
36:39
acknowledged the problem that they more or less kind of brush off this data you know I don't want to say that they're
36:44
being Cavalier about it but they're they're acting like it's not going to matter and um I think it is it's also
36:51
not as unexpected as they make it seem because Trump does hold records for the
36:59
number of black and brown voters that vote Republican over the last couple elections right
37:04
so it's not a stress to say that he's going to gain with those voters so yeah that does worry after talking with
37:10
Christina and a diverse set of young voters there was one more thing I wanted to do talk with someone close to the
37:18
Biden campaign who could help me understand the strategy as it pertains to young people
37:23
specifically so the campaign connected me to Santiago May the 22-year-old director of Voters of
37:30
Tomorrow a left-leaning group founded in 2019 with one explicit goal get Jen Z to
37:37
vote can you introduce yourself and tell me uh what you do yes hi uh I'm C mayor
37:44
I am the founder and executive director of Voters of tomorrow we are a geny
37:50
organization working to educate engage and Empower young voters you know we
37:56
talked to the leader of nextg a political group that has also endorsed Biden in 2024 and they had just
38:01
conducted a survey of young voters and wanted to talk to you about some of that the polling show Biden winning 18 to 35
38:07
year olds by only 9% which is a 15% drop off from where he was in 2020 and that
38:13
certainly overlaps with other things we've seen in data in polling that's showing some drop off between younger
38:19
voters and their support of Biden right now um and specifically true among Jin Z
38:24
I guess our first question for you was what do you think is driving this generally when I'm looking at polling
38:29
right my first question is to uh see how the questions were asked and what the
38:34
actual sort of methodology for the polling is I think we've seen a lot of polling over the past few months that
38:41
really doesn't fully reach gen C and obviously nection is specializing in
38:46
polling uh young people so I W I want this fa are polling but what I do think
38:51
is important is it is April of 2024 the election is not for for another few
38:58
months the campaign exists for a reason and I think a lot of young people are kind of just burnt out from politics
39:04
they've lift with Trump Administration which was chaos every day and they simply haven't tuned in yet and since
39:10
the sort of tickets were lined up we now know it's going to be Biden V Trump I
39:16
think as we get closer to the election we're going to see that steady increase in Joe Biden's vote share amongst young
39:22
voters and I feel very confident that Joe Biden is going to win gen C by resounding margin
39:27
mhm so I guess I don't really hear an answer to the question of what's driving that I do hear answer that he's going to
39:34
fix it I I guess I want to ask again what do you think do you think there's any validity to the idea that young
39:40
people at this point even if it's early are maybe less supportive of the Democratic president than they
39:46
previously been no listen I think there's young people want to see their
39:54
policies be represented right and I think we've seen that through Joe and I think the disconnect is really would whether what young people what policies
40:01
young people know about because when we talk to young people we see that they support a lot of the things that Jo has
40:08
done but they don't simply don't know that they've happened they don't know about the uh inflation reduction act
40:14
being the world's biggest investment in Def fighting uh climate change they don't know about the uh bipartisan gun
40:22
violence prevention Bill there there's so many accomplishments that were driven by young people people and that people
40:30
simply don't know about is there anything in the numbers and data that's coming out now about Joe Biden's
40:37
relationship to young people that has some warning signs is there anything in there that you would take to the
40:42
campaign and say hey we got to do something about this listen I think the campaign needs to talk more about how
40:48
abortion is impacting young people I think that's been an issue that has been
40:53
uh held steady in importance for young voters since uh Roby was overturn in 2022 and I think the campaign is
41:01
starting to really realize that this is something that's very important for young people MH you know for some of the young people we talk to the age of both
41:07
major party candidates is a real factor in their disillusionment with their options when they think about November
41:13
what is your response when you hear fellow young people say hey I don't want to vote for an 81y old for four more
41:19
years is Biden's age turning voters of tomorrow off I don't think so I really think that
41:26
when you look look at uh Joe Biden Donald Trump right like we're we're seeing a contrast between an old guy
41:35
that overturned Roby Wade on the right to an abortion who denied the election
41:40
who denied uh climate change who refused to take action and gun violence against another old guy who is not only insanely
41:47
empathetic but has been listening to young people on all of these issues we were just talking about warning signs I
41:52
think there's so many more warning signs for Donald Trump even including on H than for Joe Biden you know anecdotally
42:00
it doesn't really feel like young people love Joe Biden and the data is telling
42:05
me that young people don't really love Joe Biden but you seem to be telling me that young people do do I have that
42:11
right I don't think young people love any politicians I think young people are very practical and they will vote for the politician and the elected official
42:18
that will deliver results for them and in this election that decis is very clear it is Joe Biden you know last
42:25
question would be you know for this episode we talked to some clate activists who were not only not fully supportive of Biden one person was
42:30
actively organizing friends in a campaign to vote against him you know their Central argument was that Biden
42:36
has enabled a foreign policy disaster in Gaza and frankly they said kind of clearly they wanted to teach Democrats a
42:42
lesson when it comes to assuming that young voters would come home in November
42:48
I know that you are confident in the Biden campaign I know that you believe that Joe Biden's a better option than
42:54
Republicans I guess I'm asking it does any of you worry about the amount of
43:00
anti-biden sentiment that is um at least being rhetorically spread by some Young
43:06
Folks by some activist groups to looking at Young Folks right now I think it's
43:11
important to remember right that the loudest voices don't represent all of us and that at the end of the day right
43:17
like no generation is always going to fully agree on everything I think by and large we have uh a lot of time to talk
43:27
to all of these people and remind them of what we have been able to accomplish right and again I would point back to
43:34
where we were in April of 2020 and what young people were saying about Joe Biden
43:39
then and still we had a record high turnout with over 6% of young people
43:44
voting for Joe Biden thank you so much for your time I really appreciate you chatting with us and laying out your
