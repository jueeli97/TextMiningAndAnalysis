Speed Dating and Politics: What Could Go Wrong?


0:00
I'm Ashley I'm Ria and I'm out here because of
0:07
her we cousins cousin yeah no we're just trying a different way to um meet people
0:12
I mean we've been trying to dating websites and hasn't been working so we thought let's give this a try to see maybe we have better luck yeah the
0:19
struggle is real do you care about politics or issues or things like that do they come up do does it matter you
0:27
know what I will say if it's like super extreme you know what I mean and you
0:32
can't respect as an adult someone else's opinion you know what I mean but like if
0:38
you're hardcore like one way I I I can't
0:44
you know you're saying does it matter that someone agrees with you or just really matters if they disagree with you
0:51
know I think and this might I mean whatever I think
0:56
it's hardcore disagree for me that's the that's what you don't want to see that's the deal break exactly yes more than
1:03
agreeing with everything we can disagree but if you're riding hard like this is you know one of your family members I
1:11
can't it's that about an individual cidate we talking Donald Trump it's about individual issues is it like abortion or guns is there something
1:17
things that matter at the top of that list things that I've run into on the apps I don't know about this but usually
1:24
someone will ride for a candidate right now is Donald Trump and anything he said
1:29
says is gold right and it's like come on you know what I mean like nothing anyone says is gold does it matter on the
1:36
opposite side if someone thought everything Joe Biden said was gold would that be a problem um I mean I lean more
1:43
towards his social ISS like um values more than the other side but I can take
1:48
from both you know what I mean but like to ride hard right or left I you know
1:54
that would that that would be a a red flag for you or would it be a deal breaker it's a it's a beige flag B flag
2:07
okay this past weekend my colleague Alisa Gutierrez and I met Ashley and Ria
2:13
at a high place in King of Prussia a suburb about 30 minutes outside of downtown Philadelphia should
2:20
we go in yeah let's go in yeah we have a half hour when we walked in we were greeted by a big bunch of pink and red
2:25
heart balloons and a bucket of roses for five bucks a piece was sitting on the counter are you here for the
2:32
event yes we were here for a speed dating event the first crowd is uh around 25
2:39
people 12 couples the second crowd is bigger like uh 20 couples oh wow okay I
2:44
think if if anything you should stay for the second crd not to participate to be clear we're here for work so stay on
2:51
Mission instead don't get distracted but more as a thought
2:56
experiment to explore the idea of how the political divisions that can seem so present on the campaign Trail or in
3:03
polling are actually playing out in people's personal lives we set up shop at the hotel bar hi
3:11
guys wonderful meeting you guys how are you guys doing yeah that's a great question talking to people throughout
3:17
the night before their dates and after and here's what we wanted to know if you
3:23
had just a few minutes to win someone's affection how political would you get Mr
3:29
anything at all to be learned about National politics or the mood of the country from
3:36
dating from The New York Times and for Valentine's Day I'm mustad hearnen and
3:43
this is the [Music] runup can you tell me your name and can
3:49
you tell me what brought you here so my name is samoya um what brought me here is just I need to find love you know I
3:57
just want to I want someone compass um does politics matter any I do not
4:04
want it to come up they always say you know your first date don't introduce
4:09
like your ex don't talk about your ex don't talk about anything of that
4:15
harsh uh you know yeah we don't want that right now all good all goodbye very
4:22
chill just to see how the person you know flows with you I think that's what
4:27
I want to do when does it come up then if it's going to probably flow out maybe on the second dates on the second and a
4:33
half you know you know I was actually dating somebody
4:39
initially he told me that he supported Trump and I said and I just completely you know just told him you know it won't
4:46
work but then then I felt like you know what maybe I need to cuz I am new in this country I maybe I need to educate
4:53
myself a little bit more um so I feel like I should have stayed around a little bit just to hear his perspective
5:00
and to do my history um do my research you know um yeah you're
5:05
saying or do you regret cutting it off I feel like um I'm sorry I did because
5:12
there's always room for Learning and you should never really like cut somebody
5:20
off tell me your name tell me what brought you here and how's it going so far uh I just uh I I took a break from
5:26
dating was in a long relationship and then I didn't want to go on apps so uh and I don't really go to bars much so I
5:32
figured I had to look for other Alternatives you know tell me about characteristics or qualities or values that you would want in the person you're
5:38
dating um yeah you know that's a really good question in terms of like Geographic I
5:44
don't like long distance dating um yeah but in terms of values uh
5:50
I don't it's funny because those are subjects you avoid when you're first on a date with somebody um but uh Str you
5:57
don't really talk you don't really talk about that on the first dat well no you can't I mean it's tough It's hard to like even if someone agrees with you
6:03
it's such an intense subject especially in today's polarized world that even if you're sitting with someone and they
6:08
agree with you the mood is not going to be like a fun talk like Hey we're
6:14
talking about how much we like Biden or how much we like Trump it's not going to be a fun conversation it's a very uh
6:20
tumultuous environment we're in right now matter to you if some that someone cares about politics at all or doesn't
6:26
or if they didn't with that matter view um it it does matter to me that they care if somebody wants to if someone's
6:33
if you're going to size somebody up based on their political views I think that uh you're affected by what I call
6:39
the virus of the uh mainstream political scene that's basically getting everybody
6:44
riled up and divide and divided you know it wasn't like this 10 years ago we're
6:49
way more divided now you think it's really changed oh absolutely yeah it's it's so divided go ahead has any of that
6:55
changed the way you have to date no no I just like I said I avoid the subject and not because I'm you know I don't want to
7:02
lose commonality but it's it's almost like talking about a very dark subject you know that's a dark subject to talk
7:08
about right now last thing you ask is about like specific issues like you know
7:13
hot button stuff like gun rights or abortion rights or things like that if it's not maybe red versus blue do you
7:18
ever talk about specific things that you that that you believe in or you don't believe in and things like that yeah you
7:24
know I I do got something I don't I don't like the uh I don't like the push with the vaccine
7:30
that a lot of people got very um adamant about making sure somebody was vaccinated you say that on the date cuz
7:36
you have to keep that one if they brought it up I would so when Co was happening they wanted to make sure you were vaccinated now what I'm noticing is
7:43
since CO's over I'm getting people who are saying did you get the vaccine and if you and they want to know if you did
7:49
or didn't and look I don't care if you got it I'm not going to that's not going to change how I you have to say oh I
7:55
didn't get it Andes that I didn't get it but I don't I don't bring I don't judge someone who did it so in when Co was the thing they were
8:02
asking are you vaccinated now that it's over they go did you get that vaccine I've been getting that has that come up
8:08
today what's that no no um I was at a singles event uh a month ago came up
8:14
twice like it's like where you going people react to you when you say that you didn't get the vaccine so both
8:19
people who asked me were people who didn't who were adamant about not talking to people who got it you know
8:24
maybe political beliefs aren't necessarily Biden Trump but that's a belief that you hold right that's a belief
8:30
that is important to you I wonder if you share that with people as your one dates with them yeah uh no I I I I try not to
8:37
I want to get to know them and not the uh not the ideas that I feel I don't
8:42
want to say are planted in their head but have been it seems like that's kind of your biggest kind of controlling thing you want to make sure you're
8:47
listening first and judging people individually first before we get to all this other stuff absolutely yeah
8:56
yeah all right uh I'm John um 41 single for The Last 5 Years uh owning a
9:02
business and uh this was a great opportunity to get out um one question we have is specifically about division
9:09
and politics are there things you try to not talk about yeah politics yeah yeah yeah
9:18
there's no real point in talking about politics we're all just people we're our thoughts aren't going to change anything
9:25
unfortunately so like unless the government was actually going to listen to the people there's no sense in talking about it if somebody wants you
9:31
to pick a side right that that's too much uh too
9:37
demanding pick aide you know no I I just want to uh be myself so someone was a a
9:44
strong Democrat or strong Republican both of those would be things that you don't stay away from stay y i I
9:52
think most of people are somewhere in the middle of a little bit of both and
9:57
uh I everybody's allowed to have their own opinions that's what makes us so such a great country uh somebody that's
10:03
going to stop you or try to change your opinion like it's just an opinion it's not my I'm not doing what the other
10:09
side's telling me to do right like just let me be me time time to go in thank you so
10:17
much it was funny our team spend so much time in political settings at rallies
10:23
and campaign events places where people Define themselves through common political beliefs
10:29
but here it was entirely different politics wasn't just in poor taste or a
10:36
subject to be avoided it was a complete turnoff okay so my name is Karen I came
10:42
here with like a couple girlfriends they were like oh let's do this it's something different it beats being online are there like values or things
10:48
that you would put at the top of your like kind of priority list when you think about a partner or a match um I definitely have ones that like just from
10:55
past experiences and from like my past relationships I know like generosity is something that I value I don't want
11:02
someone who's trying to like mooch off of me but I also don't want someone who's like trying to take from the world
11:07
I want someone who's giving back and like who will help others like give back to be honest I really don't like to pay
11:12
for things so I'm like I do want them to be generous with me too are there um
11:17
beliefs are there things like that do you ask about that I'm very anti-political I'm not
11:25
political at all um I don't I'm a big believer and Everyone's entitled to
11:30
their own beliefs I just I'm a big believer that they shouldn't be pressing that on someone else um so I don't care
11:37
like if you're the two different sides I just I just don't want you to try to push that on me and I don't want you to
11:43
try to diminish me for what I believe in or don't believe in I don't watch the news I don't the only thing I watch is
11:50
Bravo obviously that's only news that people should be informed on um it's
11:55
just kind of that's the stance that I've taken just seeing what what the political world has done to the society
12:01
that's meant to be like United what's your strategy when you go
12:08
into these type of things what are you looking for well depending on how I feel I guess first
12:14
impressions oh you want to have a good first impression but at the same time you don't want to like put yourself out
12:21
there as like a generic canvas of like oh I'm indifferent to things so like maybe not being overtly direct about
12:28
like your political ideologies at least at the very beginning let's say you don't want to come off as someone that's
12:34
only like in a way that's like oh you're solely like a political activist for one side or the other you know I don't know
12:40
how to I don't know if that's the best way to uh I mean I just kind of go with the flow so if it comes up it comes up but
12:49
um I wouldn't bring it up appropo of nothing uhhuh cues that just makes it seem like you're an extremist like this
12:56
is all you want to talk about does it come up up and historically as you have been out there or is it easy to avoid uh
13:03
I think it's probably easy to avoid I don't think most people are as Extreme as we get an idea of on like social
13:10
media and stuff cuz you know you just get the loudest voices with social media
13:16
I think a lot of people are a little hesitant to bring stuff up if they think it's going to be a little risky I guess
13:22
it seems easy to avoid it seems like you're just trying to you're having to have a at least for that initial first one make sure you're sticking on the
13:28
more General basic yeah I mean I'm not here to make statements about my political views or anything like that
13:34
I'm just here to meet someone what brought you all here today
13:40
um my friend here my friend here invited me an experience is a friend experience
13:47
tonight about like more serious or heavier topics do you expect to be asked
13:52
about it absolutely not I don't expect to be asked about it because my questions don't really give off don't
13:58
ask me if I'm liberal you know I just I feel like it's very natural conversations it's very awkward to a lot
14:04
of people are getting out of their shell this is like their first time I don't think to ask about their political values or anything like that that there
14:11
are things that they look for that would be deal breakers for them politically do you have those type of things I mean yes
14:17
and no within reason like how crazy are you like what do you like how radical are you I should say um cuz if you're
14:23
radical then I'm like oh well no no no no I don't think about politics every day you know so it really depends uh it
14:30
doesn't rule my life I do other things so the bad sign would be if it takes up
14:35
a lot of your life that would be scared yeah that I think there's a healthy ground here when you talk about things
14:40
that cuz I don't think you live and breathe politics then that's it must be your job and if it's not your job then
14:46
you're crazy passionate about something that doesn't go within your day-to-day and if I'm a part of your dayto day
14:51
that's weird that you fit that in there I just it doesn't really correlate with my life um but if that's our values
14:56
that's fine I just they're not for me if they're really really intense about it but I
15:02
don't like that yeah I'm kind of the same way where it's like obviously if there's something that we completely
15:08
disagree on that's a big flag but but about specific issues when we think
15:13
about gun rights or abortion or anything like that is there issues that matter just as much or is it just is it like
15:20
definely specific issues like women's rights obviously I was to say can you tell me like a just like dating as a
15:27
minority if someone's like comes off a little racist I'm going to say no you know I think equality matters just in
15:34
all instances so yeah as long as someone's aligned on that affiliation is
15:40
aligned on those big things then you could figure out the smaller things well thank you we really appreciate your
15:48
time almost every single person we talk to said a version of the same thing when
15:54
it comes to politics and dating they weren't concerned about finding a partner with an identical
16:00
viewpoint but avoiding people that came off as too rigid in their thinking be it
16:06
right or left in fact the only automatic deal breaker at least to this crowd was
16:13
someone being too into politics can you imagine
16:19
that ladies and gentlemen can I your attention please we're going to take a 5 minute break after the break more in
16:26
love in politics with two inhouse [Music]
16:48
experts so according to a 2022 survey from Pew 30% of American adults are
16:54
single and the people at our speed dating experiment represent just one slice of those single people first of
17:02
all they were women looking to meet men and vice versa second they were trying a
17:08
very specific form of dating meeting strangers in real life but that's not how most people date Pew also founds
17:15
that almost half of people who are trying to meet someone are looking online so to understand more about how
17:22
the rest of the dating Universe might think about political divisions and trying to meet a match I call two
17:28
colleagues with expertise in the area uh producers I'm going to kick it off if you give me a thumbs up great to ask
17:35
them specifically about some of what we heard hey I'm really excited to be here can we just start with some
17:41
introductions can you tell me who you are and what you do I am Jess gross I am an opinion writer for the New York Times
17:48
okay and I'm Anna Martin I'm the host of The Modern Love podcast from the times
17:54
oh I am so excited to have yall both here because um we did this thing over the weekend and me and Alisa our
18:01
colleague went to a speed dating event in the suburbs of Philadelphia first like kind of personal question have any
18:07
of y'all ever been speed dated I have not neither have I and I feel like I
18:12
should go for reporting purposes so I'm jealous of y'all I mean to be honest with you it was a lot of people who were
18:18
talking about wanting to get out of the kind of rat race of online dating it was a lot of people trying to switch their
18:24
lens to to give people a more good faith in person chance and it was kind of hopeful like I do think there there is
18:30
something uh classic about the act of trying to see someone in real life I
18:36
mean Jess I wanted to start with you because part of the reason we wanted you here is you've done some reporting about
18:42
how our larger understanding in politics fits in with dating and relationships it actually gave us the idea to go to speed
18:48
dating in the first place what have you been working on so I had seen a lot of commentary late last year about how
18:54
young men were more conservative and young women were more liberal and how that was going to destroy marriage
19:01
forever in the United States and uh I thought that that was overblown and I
19:07
wanted to talk to people under 30 about how politics inform their dating life and I put out a little survey in my
19:13
newsletter and uh I got back almost 300 responses and I had in-depth conversations with probably 20 people
19:21
and it was really fascinating well we're going to talk more about those conversations but first I wanted to know
19:26
what do we know more broadly about how Americans sort themselves romantically so the first thing to know I think about
19:33
politics kind of applicable to everything we talk about is 80% of
19:38
people do not care that much about politics 20% who we talk about a lot care a lot about politics um and so that
19:48
being said there is a a thing called homop people like dating and marrying
19:55
people like themselves so that's on a number of factors that's on attractiveness level that's on you know
20:01
ambition education class race religion all of those things so politics is just
20:07
one of those things and it is really really important to some people and less
20:12
important to others that makes sense intuitively I guess one question I have just following up is like well how do we
20:19
Define care and not care in that like ad20 right like cuz 60% of the country
20:25
50 60% vote right like how defining how much someone's political identity takes
20:31
up in their kind of so I mean it's not sort of a hard and fast definition but I think the way it's sort of roughly
20:38
defined is do you keep up with politics every day do you read the news all the
20:43
time is it something that you talk about frequently or are you someone who Tunes in a month before the election and you
20:50
know then starts to care about voting care about sort of the whole thing I would say that 80% it's just not coming
20:56
up in their dayto day and in in fact for that group of people someone being really into politics is a turnoff for
21:02
them we're going to get there because that's something that we heard over this weekend was actually people who were
21:08
saying that the most alarming thing to them is people who are kind of too into politics uh Anna in the work that you
21:13
all do or Modern Love how does like politics come up when someone is thinking about their own relationship uh
21:20
and their own kind of way they're going about love I would say that Modern Love approaches politics and love from like
21:27
I'm going to take a broader view of it like I see a lot of the Dynamics the power dynamics the financial Dynamics
21:34
the Dynamics of control the Dynamics of Desire that are inherent in a ton of Modern Love Stories as inherently
21:40
political Dynamics on our show we cover romantic relationships we cover familial
21:46
relationships friendships your relationship with yourself and I think that you know why someone feels pulled
21:51
to do something or push to do another thing like I think that those decisions are political in a sort of broader zoom
21:57
out way M I want to ask you both how overtly does politics come up in dating part of
22:03
the research and Reporting you were doing and like is there any examples that we have of who's most likely to bring it up when they're most likely to
22:10
bring it up or if people avoid it so it really is kind of all over the place I
22:15
think some people who again it it's very important to them they screen you know
22:20
either they're screening uh in terms of context clues so it was really funny to
22:26
hear people who do a lot of online dating say like if they don't put their political affiliation in their profile I
22:33
try to look at their pictures and you know if they're hunting or fishing they're definitely conservative this was
22:39
all women um and I actually love the nuances of like the liberal man
22:44
posturing cuz it was like he's in a coffee shop usually he's wearing a beanie uh if he says he loves Taylor
22:51
Swift that was a big thing that came up that was like as a as a pro as a pro
22:57
it's I am liberal and a feminist because I am signaling to
23:05
you um I just loved it I could literally talk all day to people who are dating
23:11
about those sort of non verbal context image clue like I just loved that
23:17
discussion you're talking about sort of overt signaling which I well I don't know how overt Taylor Swift is I'd have to read a little bit into that one but
23:24
you know being very overt about their political opinions on their profile but I think so the conversations I have with
23:29
people are about sort of the gray areas like the moderate or the you know I come from this area of the country so people
23:35
reading into the backstory there you know the sort of if we get to the first date like if we move on from the dating
23:42
profile you know I think we have a lot of conversation with people who are dating who are very surprised by like
23:47
the person who shows up perhaps they had something on their profile that indicated they might lean a certain way or hold certain values and then when the
23:54
real Flesh and Blood person shows up they're totally different so I think some of the um more interesting
23:59
conversations I've had on our show where people are surprised because the signaling indicated one way and and the
24:05
in-person person Pro different what was really interesting was that the people and
24:11
again this is not like a scientific sample but the people I talked to who were more likely to be dating across
24:17
political differences had met in person they had not totally this is what I was going to say is that even in this kind
24:23
of conversations does seem to be clear that like the type of people who are interested in sorting who are interested in homophily the H we call it
24:30
homop again we could be both butchering it like we right like if we're thinking about that politically more specifically
24:37
like the type of people who are in that 20% who matter it does seem like online dating provides them in an ability to
24:43
sort that an in real life connection uh makes more complicated because you know the nuances of real people are just more
24:49
unique right totally totally yeah um and I think what comes up a lot in my reporting about lots of different topics
24:56
is that most people their beliefs do not neatly line up with you know the
25:03
Democratic or Republican Party platform right we all have a combination of you
25:08
know beliefs that often don't make sense when they're all together and I think
25:13
that that's what makes it interesting to really get in deep and and ask people why they came to the decisions that they
25:21
made yeah and certainly I think that's one thing that Drew us to your reporting is because that overlaps with how we talk to people about politics too like
25:27
the the idea that someone fits very neatly into a Democrat box or a republican box or even you know
25:32
Progressive or conservative or whatever often takes more Nuance forms one thing that came up as we were talking to
25:38
people over the weekend was the idea that you can separate values from politics or that what they were looking
25:44
for in someone in a relationship was kind of understanding who they were and for some people that seemed distinct
25:50
from Politics as we would put in quotes and for some people those two things couldn't be separated I wonder if that
25:57
came up in your reporting too it did it came up frequently and I think as in
26:03
many things Donald Trump is specifically polarizing more than anything else
26:09
because I think especially for the women I spoke to supporting Donald Trump to
26:15
them signaled a baseline disrespect for women or I often I also heard a lot they
26:21
felt a baseline disrespect for immigrants if their parents were immigrants if they came from you know if they were first generation
26:28
so that came up a lot but there actually was sort of a lot more flexibility
26:35
around those things because again it was like okay we disagree about this one thing but if they explained to me how
26:43
they came to this belief and I can understand that and I think that it shows good values then I'm okay with it
26:50
I'm glad you brought up identity though because I mean we were obviously at a hetero like speed dating event and at
26:57
that like the way that people talked about their own gender identity was the most common form of political expression
27:03
that was coming up so when we were talking to the women who were there there was some idea that of course at
27:10
some point I need to know what he thinks about women's role in relationships or
27:15
how he views his own role in relationships whereas The Men We were talking to were kind of
27:21
universally saying I'm not bringing this up until it absolutely has to my goal
27:27
here is to make this apolitical for as long as possible when you all hear that does that surprise you no it doesn't
27:35
surprise me um I am s i I guess I'm a little surprised and impressed that the
27:41
women were like I need to know this early on some some yeah somewhere true story one time I was on a date in uh
27:48
Boston I'm going to make sure every dating story I say is at least like five six years
27:53
old like massiv let me make sure I whatever but one time I was on a date this is right
28:00
early in my journalism career I was a crime reporter for the Boston Globe and I had that day been to a murder trial uh
28:07
because I was covering a teenager who had shot another teenager okay so I go on this date and this uh woman asks like
28:16
oh what did you do today and you know I start saying actually you know it's really sad like cover this stuff and
28:22
blah blah blah blah blah and she goes like well what do you think about juveniles being charged as adults
28:29
because this child and I was like I'm not about to share too many like full opinions I'm still in journalist mode
28:35
like we're just Ming each other so I was like oh you know it's complicated you know I tried to give like a very like middle of the road answer and uh she
28:43
goes I need to know what you think about prison abolition right now whoa and I
28:48
was like oh and she ended up actually leaving to be honest with you but if
28:54
that would have been date two or three I wouldn't have answered in the same way I probably would have answered in a more open way so I definitely feel like the
29:02
timing really matters here too well okay so this is one thing I haven't mention yet one of the political scientists I
29:07
spoke to for the series that I did said there is a real difference between dating behavior and mating behavior
29:13
right so it's like are you how serious are you right now like if and if you're
29:18
not that serious in your dating it like I think you obviously have a much broader idea and there's fewer deal
29:26
breakers but if you are looking you're like I want to settle down I'm trying to find my person then I think it things
29:32
sort of Ratchet up and that brings me to like my other you know very strongly held belief after doing this reporting
29:38
which is that thirst outweighs politics for like a lot of people I actually
29:44
totally agree with that I completely Co like like if you want if you're if you're thirsty enough you'll put it to
29:50
the side absolutely or you figure out a way to justify it to yourself the other thing I want to throw in is there are a
29:56
lot of um people who find love later in life so either like post divorce or and
30:02
I feel like this conversation has centered around younger people I don't know the age of the people at the speed event I would assume like 20s 30s we
30:09
went to 5 to 7 was 20s to 30s and 7 to n was 30s and 40s oh I'm so interested in
30:14
hearing about that but you know we have so many conversations with people who are sort of this sounds negative but I
30:21
can't think of another way say like sort of calcified in their ways of thinking or living or you know the way that they approach family the way that they
30:28
approach politics certainly and we have a lot of very beautiful Modern Love stories of people sort of being broken
30:33
out of those ways because of a new love or surprised by them but I will say it's like I'd be so interested thinking about
30:40
all of this through the lens of dating as a slightly older person um well I can say that like one thing that stuck out
30:46
to me just in the people it was the the older set of women who were more
30:52
comfortable saying I want to know more quickly like what's his purpose here but
30:58
I guess like nobody wanted to frontally mention politics at speed dating and the
31:05
clearest thing that came through was really an aversion to the kind of
31:10
explicit team waving you know they did not want someone who was a mega Democrat
31:15
or a mega Republican weariness of strong political opinions no matter what you
31:20
know I guess I'm wondering like how much do you think the idea of intense politics being a red flag or beige flag
31:27
or turn off for people is a widely held belief so I actually think it's a third thing possibly which is just exhaustion
31:35
like the past you know eight years let's say have just been so ranker and ugly
31:42
and I think a lot of people even who might have very strongly held beliefs they just don't want that anymore it has
31:48
taken too Central uh a role in their lives and their discourse and they're sick of it uh what was interesting is
31:54
when we met a couple people who did hold really strong beliefs and they were very aware that it could be a turnoff to
32:01
people we're going to play One Clip of a guy talking about the importance of Faith to them and how they talk about
32:06
that in dating so I am a Christian and I'm definitely looking for somebody who's
32:12
has the same Faith um It's Tricky though like I try not to be so upfront about it
32:18
at these kind of things cuz it's a it's a mixer it's just trying to see if we have any common interest see if we have
32:24
a common background yeah when you said say I'm a Christian and my faith matters to me there's a lot of there's some some
32:30
folks can make assumptions about what that means about you politically and you're saying because of that you try to
32:35
be conscious about when you reveal that information I mean and if it's almost like we're playing this game of chicken
32:41
like I'm waiting for her to sell me like if she believes in God or or I may bring up some sort of thing about like oh I
32:48
went to a lunch with my small group and then oh who's that small group that is my church small group but um yeah so I
32:56
try to make it come out more organically than be like okay I go to church every Sunday I have a small group Bible study
33:02
that I meet on Tuesday nights and we kind of do this thing like cuz if the person doesn't understand that or know
33:08
that then it's like I don't know maybe it is better that I kind of be upfront with it cuz I I it could be a very
33:14
touchy subject for some people yeah I mean I have some follow-ups on that because you know that's important to you
33:20
and because that would be important in relationship how do you negotiate when to talk about it versus maybe when to
33:25
not bring it up and then something like this where you're going to talk to someone for 7 minutes do you expect to talk about your
33:30
faith yeah and that's that's the challenging part because like I think what ends up happening a lot of people start making it very political and then
33:37
I just do not want to go down that what do you mean like so like typically if if you're a Christian then it's like oh
33:44
you're Republican or you're conservative in very specific areas like the abortion
33:49
or the gun rights and everything like that and then that's where it's just like I don't want I don't these preconceived notions I don't want that
33:56
to be how how we're communicating to each other and and just I want it to be a little bit more relaxed and want them
34:02
to feel comfortable like that way what I mean like specifically what what are the
34:08
sort of like preconceptions people have that you think you you would say you don't agree with I'm Pro lifee no matter
34:15
what that's the conception people have or yeah because I'm a Christian yeah can
34:21
I ask are you it's I I I I'm
34:27
I'm more pro choice to be honest you say that on dates does that come up I don't
34:33
mention that ever on a date something you got to go thank you so much for talking to
34:40
us I have multiple thoughts the first is I did a Series last year about people moving away from organized religion and
34:47
there based on tons of research there is a way in which in this country Christianity has been branded as a
34:52
religion of the far right so if you do not have those political beliefs uh often people are a little bit afraid of
34:59
saying that they are a Christian because they think it will you know attach them to a set of beliefs that they do not
35:05
identify with so the other thing that I think of when I hear him talk is when I was reporting this politics and dating
35:11
series The often couples who were split about their abortion stance shared a
35:17
religious background which was super interesting to me I'm thinking particularly of one couple they were
35:23
both Catholic and they both believe that you shouldn't have sex before marriage
35:28
because I asked I was like well as a practical matter like this is dangerous
35:34
if you're you know and they're like well we don't it's moot because because the thing we agree on yes kind of like
35:41
precedes the abortion question exactly so it's all theoretical and so I just thought you know it again it just comes
35:48
back to like what is the value system that is informing the belief and they could live with each other's value
35:55
system and how they came to being pro-choice or pro-life and it was based in this sort of Christian value system
36:02
um and I thought that was really interesting interesting you know another thing a person mentioned to me while there is as a liberal leaning person
36:09
this was a woman who was speaking she said that she actually regretted writing off a trump supporter she previously
36:15
dated and that came up a couple times not necessarily just with Trump supporter specifically but the people at
36:21
this event saying that they think that in the past in the recent kind of political past they were too consumed
36:28
with their sense of ideology and cut people off in ways that they now
36:34
currently regret it I guess I'm as as people who are thinking about kind of the individual ways that people make
36:41
connections like how should I think about those feelings alongside the
36:47
things I think about all the time the division the polarization the kind of macro stuff that comes up in politics a
36:52
lot like there is an argument here whether it's spe dating or do the work that that you all do that like once you
36:59
step out of the red versus blue we are a little more connected or once you get into The Thirst right like we're a
37:05
little more connected like do you think that stuff is true like I'm kind of skeptical of that concept like that love
37:12
conquers all you know but like is am I being a am I being like a jaded human
37:18
here like is that a real lesson of these kind of individual connections I mean I
37:23
think it's just that politics is just one part of what makes up our belief
37:30
system and our value system and who we are and how it manifests right so I don't think love conquers all but I
37:38
think that for most people their political beliefs are not the most important thing about them or not the
37:44
thing that they value most about themselves and I might let you have the last word here like put the divisions in
37:49
context for us like in your work where do you land on the love conquers all scale yeah I mean I I would love to to
37:56
say that it does but I I would say the more accurate like this is just my view
38:01
I would say love conquers what we want it to conquer like in a lot of ways I feel like when I have these
38:08
conversations with people about the most meaningful relationships of their life and and honestly the series of very
38:14
difficult decisions that often we have to make to get to a love that lasts like I I realize that love really is just
38:20
that which is a series of decisions it's like an active thing love is not passive
38:26
and so I mean now I sound like one of those like motivational speakers but I truly believe that I think that love
38:31
conquers what we want it to conquer because we have to make a choice so I really do see like to love and to be
38:37
loved and to make those choices like I'm saying as a sort of radical in its own way Act of Hope so I'd say that like no
38:43
love does not conquer all yes we can decide that it can conquer big things if we let it and like also to love is a
38:50
very hopeful a very hopeful orientation toward the future and I think that's what we y all should aim for and that
38:57
ends my speech my grand you know this is the best I felt about this year all year
39:03
you know like like I I think there's like a version of this year that looks really doom and gloomy but I'm going take your perspective and I'm going make
