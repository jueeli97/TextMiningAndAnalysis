okay cool let's do this one all right thank y'all appreciate what you do can we ask you one question my name isad
3:19
this is Caitlin we're from The New York Times we're talking to people about the referendum and uh partially like why they are like motivated to sign you said
3:26
you knew already what it was I'm curious like how this came on your radar this has been on my radar for a long long
3:31
time I've had friends in situations where their health is threatened where uh the quality of life for not only the
3:37
mother who was pregnant and their existing family and the baby would have been negatively impacted by the addition
3:43
to the family I understand how our planet itself is facing crisis when it
3:48
comes to Health Care Medical Care with just no with just a sustainability you
3:55
know overall we can't sustain the rate at which we're rep populating um so just
4:00
whole lot of reasons and you know I never had to face this choice but my mother has I've had three best friends
4:07
who have you know and and I understand it's just not it's not right for anybody to make that decision for somebody else
4:13
you someone who considers themselves like Democrat Republican did you see that kind of outside I just issue but
4:19
issue yeah it's Arizona's place in this election is so big and on this issue is going to be really big too are you
4:25
talking to people about this like how much has this been three jobs and I'm in school and I'm a single mom and I take take care of m mom going talk to nobody
4:31
he said I don't talk to nobody but I know what I feel about this yeah absolutely appreciate y'all have a good
4:36
one yeah y'all stay hydrated do you guys have snake snake
4:43
took some back TRS and saw snake so be careful all right come on honey bun have a good day
4:50
day I didn't feel that was exploiting the child
4:56
hey you didn't at all he was adorable oh
5:02
uh if you're a Democrat or someone who wants President Biden to win reelection there hasn't been a lot of
5:09
good news lately most polling following Trump's criminal conviction shows him tide
5:16
oread Republicans have started to close the democrat's advantage in fundraising in this week President
5:23
Biden's average approval rating dropped to the lowest in his entire term as voters continue to prefer Trump on
5:30
issues like immigration and the economy but in state and local elections over the past 2 years there's a good
5:38
argument that abortion rights has been the most politically Salient issue of all throwing the Republican Party into
5:45
chaos and helping Democrats achieve key victories throughout the
5:51
midterms so for the next 2 weeks we're going to focus on how abortion rights
5:56
could impact the 2024 election do the to the lens of Arizona a Battleground state
6:02
that Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020 and that both parties are desperate to claim in
6:08
November today how abortion rights groups have turned the dobs decision into their most
6:14
potent political weapon and the Democrats trying to seize on
6:19
it from The New York Times I'm aad hearnen this is the runup
6:28
[Music] how often have you been uh going out to
6:35
collect signatures well we're out here six days a week we're trying Trail heads
6:40
but we go to Parks we go to you know bookstores we go to nice little bars we
6:47
any place where we think we can capture a demographic we'll try to get there um
6:52
so Susan and Steve are volunteering with Arizona for abortion access a coalition
6:58
of groups collecting signatur for this ballot measure that would create a constitutional right to an abortion in
7:04
Arizona right now abortion is legal there up to 15 weeks if this measure
7:10
passes it will be protected up to fetal viability which is usually defined
7:16
around 22 to 24 weeks so it also allows for some exceptions the group says they
7:21
already have well over the number of signatures they need to get the measure on the ballot but they're still collecting anyway in anticipation of
7:28
legal challenge work this might seem intuitive but can you explain why it's this issue that you
7:33
think motivated you specifically about yes so I was absolutely in despair uh
7:42
about what was happening here and for me this issue I said okay this is something
7:48
I can do that will have an impact that will drive people to the polls cuz we have a big problem here with not being
7:55
able to get the younger demographic and get the minority demographic and we've got to get those out to vote yes we've
8:02
got to get those people out to vote and I figured that this cause which is also
8:08
very dear to my heart because I mean I was 16 when Mo versus Wade came in and
8:14
never had to worry about this issue at all and I'm outraged at what they're trying to take the cabiness of what is
8:23
happening here I cannot believe that in this day and age that they inter in in
8:30
this thing at all um but it is it's a very powerful and resonates quite a bit
8:36
with the voters and that's a that's a great thing so if we can get these people who sign this out to the polls
8:43
that will be wonderful the efforts got a surprising boost in April when the state supreme
8:49
court revived in 1864 law written back when Arizona was still a territory that
8:55
would have made nearly all abortions illegal the state legislature overturn the law was that but it drove a lot of
9:01
Engagement absolutely you as soon as the 1864 was passed when we were out
9:07
petitioning we would get maybe a page you know we were getting four and five and six pages at a time people were
9:13
lined up to come and sign the petition and they would wait in line to be able
9:19
to do that now and again occasionally we'll get a little bit of a rush but for the most part it's one Z2 z3z but when
9:25
we had you know a dozen people in line waiting for this it was it was it was
9:30
exciting uh but also kind of upsetting that it took that to get people to want
9:36
to sign the the initiative that you know that so again we were crushed by the
9:41
fact that they did it but really thankful that it actually got some people who were kind of on the fence or
9:47
thinking it's going to be okay without my help they realized and honestly that was part of us you know we were home
9:53
looking at the television you know screaming at it complaining and I said we can scream and complain at the television or we canle
10:00
to the television and do something as we've been talking some more people had started wandering by are you a
10:07
registered voter I am in Maricopa County I am do you know what you're signing this is the pro-choice women's
10:12
reproductive Freedom yep I I already signed this one at Changing Hands thank you for the support the women in your
10:17
life thank you do you need a which gave us an opportunity to pull them aside and learn a little more about the type of
10:23
arizonas that we supporting the efforts Tony estad nice to meet you to meet you so just curious like you said you
10:29
already signed how did this issue come on your radar oh it's been on my radar for quite some time you know it's been
10:35
very disappointing that Democrats in general haven't prioritized codifying row even before you know the Supreme
10:42
Court loading with Trump and like it's an important issue no matter where you stand on it like morally if you just
10:48
look at it from the perspective of so many things can go wrong during a pregnancy right and besides all that
10:55
it's still just between the woman and her doctor and her family and that's
11:01
where the choice should lie yeah and I don't believe the state should be involved in that whatsoever and uh yeah
11:07
I'm proud to see that my community is out here lobbying for these types of issues you someone who considers himself a Democrat Republican independent
11:14
anything um you know I probably would have identified as a Democrat for
11:19
majority of time but they're probably more right than you know than I than I
11:25
am like I I feel like I would probably put myself more in a independent camp
11:31
now um to be perfectly honest with you it was probably around the the 2016 election a candidate like Trump doesn't
11:38
come to fruition if the Democratic party actually listens to its constituents and prioritize the issues that that we talk
11:45
about you thinking yeah you should democrats should see Trump ascending as a democratic failure correct absolutely
11:51
um because you lost a lot of Independence um you lost a lot of people again that are talking about the real
11:57
things that are happening right now in our communities right like you can't buy a house in the city now we're not
12:03
talking about those things and doing anything about them at a legislative level that actually pushes that makes
12:09
the middle class stronger that gives opportunities to lower class coming up you know I don't really believe that the
12:16
Democratic party even understands what their base is and so am I okay with more of the same if it means that we don't
12:23
have Trump back in power then yeah but am I disappointed overall about the directionality of of politics and
12:31
like yeah where we're going as a Democratic party like I'm not so um so
12:37
what I hear is you might end up voting for Biden in the fall but you see it as more of an anti-trump vote than like an endorsement of the democratic party's
12:43
Direction yeah I I think um we have to do a better job at a Grassroots level to like make our voices heard I I love
12:49
seeing things like this people out here uh lobbying for issues that matter to them I think at a community level we
12:55
have to like open conversations more people just in general feel very divided
13:00
because they just dig their heels into issues and they don't want to listen to the other side right like to be
13:05
perfectly honest with you when I was younger I used to be a uh a pro-life Advocate like I was brought up that way
13:11
that's what I believed and it wasn't until I had a real conversation with a
13:17
dear friend of mine that had to make a difficult choice and it opened my eyes
13:23
right but and if I wasn't open to that conversation with that person that was willing to share her story with me I
13:28
don't know that I I start that path I hear you and so yeah I think on on both
13:34
sides we need to listen and we need to be uh open to having these discussions
13:40
um I was born and raised here this is my backyard my community and I've seen it go from a hard red to a purple state so
13:46
I know progress is possible but we're not doing enough cool thank you thank you so much get to your hi I appreciate
13:52
it have a great day pleasure meeting you both thank you on a few more people came by we
14:00
productive freedom for women uh obviously yes 100% okay some supporters have you signed our petition yet what's
14:07
this this is women's reproductive choice I don't believe in that I believe that choice is for the baby got it thank you
14:14
see this and some opponents who didn't want to engage have you signed the initiative yet then are you Arizona
14:21
voters yep I signed already you signed thank you have you signed sir I will absolutely sign
14:27
perfect so are you registered ver I am are you in miraco County I do there you
14:33
go you've answered everything properly and do you know what you're signing yes okay a small group came by can we just
14:39
got your names real quick yeah Morgan who just come down from the trail you said that the issue was like something
14:45
you already knew about how did this get on your radar yeah it's just a long running issue within Arizona and it's
14:50
really unfortunate because like we already have enough problems here but
14:56
stting what women and women can't do with their bodies is just it's gross it's disgusting it's not okay have you
15:02
guys always voted do you associate yourself with a particular political party or identify with one uh yeah I've
15:08
always been a voter uh independent and Democrat how about you I i' would say
15:16
inconsistent voter but more I guess Democrat leading independent yeah you
15:21
know obviously this is going to be a unique presidential election because it's going to be a rematch between Biden
15:26
and Trump when we talk to people about that we get a lot of range of opinions about the fact that it's going to be the
15:31
two same candidates again what do you think about that and like how are you feeling about the job that President Biden's doing if you mind me asking I
15:38
think President Biden is doing a great job I think the economy has been in its
15:43
best in many many years even before Trump or Obama I mean of course things change
15:52
times change things become more expensive that's just kind of how everything goes and that's you know think you can't buy things for a Kenny
16:00
anymore so things change you know you just got to adapt to those things and that there's nothing to do with him and
16:06
of course you know with the two running against each other again definitely not
16:12
Trum ever he is the biggest child
16:19
Manchild ever did you go on the last presidential election I did did you mind who I asked
16:25
you voted for do you vote Biden Trump uh we I would vote Biden do you think think you're going to vote again in this one
16:31
no I don't think so I think the voting climate rate now is just really exhausting for a lot of people the two-
16:36
party system is frustrating only having the same two options um I don't think we should have you know deep senior
16:42
citizens in office making decisions for the country they're Antiquated their beliefs are old uh it's just not
16:48
Progressive it's not what the direction we should be going you're saying the candidate options that are presented now
16:54
make you not want to vote yeah absolutely not it's just yeah either one or the other and neither is really great
17:02
yeah I mean we heard how you feel about Trump how do you feel about Trump um not a big fan I think he elicits a lot
17:09
of anger and and a lot of separation between people it's it's not a good look
17:15
for our country and it's not a it's not a community-driven thing it doesn't make
17:20
people like believe each other help each other out it just creates walls and that's that's a bummer so yeah but he's
17:27
not it's not enough for you you wouldn't votee for Biden to stop him it seems no
17:33
why not I don't necessarily think it stops it it's just a two- party system you know it's it's two groups of people
17:39
perpetually screaming at each other it's a vote's not going to help yeah but it seems like what is motivating you all is
17:45
things like this referendum you know you may not want those candidates back but you do want stuff like abortion rights to be enshrine yes yes got what say
17:52
sorry would that bring you to the polls if this is on the ballot absolutely yeah
17:58
100% but would you skip over the presidential race uh I mean if I'm there I'm there
18:04
I'll probably make a choice and vote but otherwise I'm not super interested in
18:10
it thank you so much we really appreciate your time thank you have a great day
18:16
bye the hikers who are supporting the ballot initiative pretty much represent the Coalition of Voters that abortion
18:23
rights Advocates are hoping for a mix of committed liberals and some others who may not support Democrats traditionally
18:30
or vote regularly but are more motivated specifically by this issue but I wasn't
18:36
sure of groups like Arizona for abortion access saw their efforts as directly connected to helping President Biden win
18:44
okay let me just figure out where we're going so we headed back into downtown Phoenix can you introduce yourself and
18:50
tell me what you do my name is Athena Salman to meet with Athena Salman I am the director of Arizona campaigns for
18:56
Reproductive freedom for all I mobilize 75,000 members that we have in Arizona
19:02
to move Reproductive Rights and Freedoms um in every single congressional
19:08
district in the state we're working to flip the state legislature we're working to pass the ballot initiative and
19:13
ultimately uh secur huge Reproductive Rights victories in Arizona moving forward and you're a former state
19:18
legislator and I'm a former state legislator Athena has lived in Arizona for her whole life I've seen a lot of
19:25
changes in the State College when I was in college that is when um we got a
19:30
republican Trifecta so the governor was Republican the legislature was controlled by Republicans and prior to
19:37
that with the former Governor she was vetoing a lot of the really harsh bills that were passing through the
19:43
legislature but that's what really got me involved the the budget cuts to education the attacks on women's rights
19:51
on immigration rights she joined the state legislature in 2017 when Arizona
19:56
was in the midst of its shift to purple so in 18 not only did we flip the US
20:01
senate seat but we also picked up enough seats for the Republicans to have a on
20:08
vote majority and that's where we've been stuck ever since but it is so so
20:14
close and then the and then came dos in 2022 I'll never forget that
20:21
moment people who I had known to be lifelong Republicans having their voices heard at The Ballot Box doing the
20:27
research of like okay you know what I I I really don't care about the party anymore I want to know who are the
20:34
candidates that are going to fundamentally protect this right and then in the 2022 election cycle we saw
20:41
huge victories with Governor Hobbs um who campaigned on the issue of abortion
20:46
defeating extremist Cary Lake and then also very significantly is attorney general Chris ma who won that seat
20:54
Statewide seat by 280 votes yeah um and now she's just one of our most vocal
21:01
active Defenders of reproductive freedom in Arizona Athena and her group see
21:06
abortion as the issue they need to finally push Arizona across the line with reproductive freedom for All We are
21:13
continuing to work to flip the legislature so we have a majority that supports reproductive freedom and then
21:19
of course um we're one of the founding members and we're part of the coalition to secure the right to abortion in the
21:26
Constitution through the citizen initiative so that in the future our rights aren't up in the air and people
21:32
aren't being whiplashed back and forth based on what a politician or a judge does um can you take me through what the
21:39
November referendum would include both in terms of abortion access and the possible exceptions after yeah
21:46
absolutely so um first what we are talking about here is a citizen initiative that will actually have the
21:53
effect of protecting the legal right to abortion in Arizona at the end of the day uh the language got uh um put in a
22:01
place where we know that it very much closely restores the rights that we had under roie weade what that means is up
22:09
until fetal viability the right of abortion is intact and protected for
22:14
anyone who is seeking care and after viability there is the room for the
22:20
decision to uh seek abortion care to be protected between the provider and the
22:26
patient uh for healthy reasons which includes mental health reasons the reality with pregnancy is you cannot
22:33
predict every complication and so that is why it's so important for that
22:39
provision to be protected of after viability that's the bottom line here
22:45
and as a former elected official and policy maker you can't legislate every
22:50
single reason why someone would need an abortion and terminate a pregnancy but what you can do is you can make sure
22:58
that when someone has made that decision and needs to cross that bridge that there is a way for them to get access to
23:06
that health care when they need it free from punishment or judgment and when we say feed of viability is there a week's
23:13
time to that um it really that's determined by Pro providers M you know when when it became clear that the
23:19
ballot measure was probably going to get enough uh signatures to appear in November in political world there was a
23:24
lot of sense of like how much that shifts the presidential election that you know with such a consensus issue in
23:30
such an important state that the best thing that could happen to Joe Biden maybe doesn't have to do with him at all
23:35
but might be this thing happening in the state does the way that this referendum affects Donald Trump versus Joe Biden is
23:42
that part of the calculus any no because when you look at the the partisan breakdown it's a third a third a third
23:49
right a third Democrat third uh Republican a third unaffiliated voters
23:54
and even in the last few election Cycles candidates who campaign AED on the right
24:00
to legal abortion ended up winning and securing those seats so the voters are smart they do their research and when
24:07
you compare the two track records Donald Trump appointed the justices who undermined and overturned 50 years of
24:15
legal precedent protecting the right to abortion our current president has made a commitment to protect and restore a
24:23
federal right to abortion so at the end of the day the voters already see that contrast and that's what they're going
24:28
to be going to The Ballot Box even though Donald Trump is currently saying that he doesn't support a federal abortion ban you're saying the past is
24:35
still enough to hold on to yeah we are in this mess Arizona is in this mess
24:40
because of Donald Trump and because of what he did to the Supreme Court uh so
24:45
voters voters will remember that thank you so much I really appreciate it yeah yeah thank you no
24:52
[Music] I Athena is describing a scario that
24:59
Democrats are banking on in 2024 recent polling shows that 65% of
25:04
likely Arizona voters support the abortion Amendment so Advocates hope
25:10
that not only do a wide range of Voters show up in November to iny a women's right to choose in the state they also
25:17
punished Donald Trump for the role he played in overturning row and sending this issue back to the states to begin
25:24
with and while that could be true Trump has also tried to distance himself from
25:30
his party's most extreme positions on the issue so much so that it seemed
25:35
worth asking are there Arizona voters who support abortion rights and
25:42
Trump after the break Caitlyn goes to find [Music]
25:51
out after several days in the Phoenix area I actually had to fly out because of a previous engagement but Caitlyn
25:59
stuck around because there was one more event in Arizona that we wanted to go to in the far west of the state about a
26:06
4our drive from Phoenix in Bullhead City Bullhead City is in Mojave County an
26:12
area nestled in the desert between Phoenix and Las Vegas that's very very
26:18
conservative four years ago Trump got almost 75% of the vote in Mojave County
26:24
but that didn't stop Pam Shin she's a volunteer for Arizona for abortion access who lives in the area and was
26:31
planning to gather signatures at her neighborhood Bunko club meeting and if you don't know what Bunko is don't worry
26:39
neither did we what is Bunko oh okay it's a dice
26:44
game okay you take Dice and there's you know one through six on the dice and you have to get like first you throw for
26:50
ones then you throw for twos then you throw for three then you throw for four all the way up to six then we rest we have a little snack and then we do round
26:57

got involved in the ballad initiative after the state moved to revive its 1864 band I went to go sign it and I said
28:20
I'll help I'll try to get signatures that's how I found out about because I researched it and I said oh my God where
28:26
can I sign this because I heard about it and they changed it that it was so barbaric like to me it was like why are
28:31
you taking my rights what are you going to do take my voting rights away next what are you going to do next I mean if you're going to do this I we've only
28:37
been voting for 100 years I mean what else are you going to take and start taking birth control away and IVF and I
28:43
just like I have to do something I don't want to just sit at home and whine about it I want to do something proactive and
28:50
if that is getting signatures to put a petition onto the ballot so that we can vote all all arizonans can vote not just
28:57
Republicans Or democrats or Independents everybody and so for me it's not a
29:02
matter of do I agree with abortion do I practice abortion that's not my thing my
29:08
thing is about the choice of women having an option if they have no other option to do this and it shouldn't be
29:15
taken away Pam is focused on winning people over here many of whom like her
29:21
have conservative Roots it's a very very red area and I'm not a red person okay I
29:28
used to be a republican I hate to admit but I'm no longer a republican ever since the Trump era started I changed my
29:35
my ticket I said that's it I can't I don't believe in this I didn't vote for him I won't vote for him I never will
29:41
vote for him but living here in this area has been horrendous for me having to watch people that my good friends
29:49
believe in something that they it's just like like they're brainwashed is so bad
29:54
here so you're a volunteer for Arizona for abortion access what's it like Gathering signatures for this abortion
30:00
ballot initiative here sometimes it's kind of tough because you're dealing with a lot of preset Notions of you know
30:06
there's a there's some that's very religious there's some there's not there's some that you know are like well
30:12
that just goes against everything you're baby killer I'm like I'm not a baby killer I'm a nurse how could I be a baby
30:17
killer I'm not about killing children but it's just their backwards thinking and most of the women like you'll see
30:23
are older group here and most of them have already live their lives but it's their children and their grandchildren
30:29
that now have these laws they had the freedom to choose why don't you want the same thing for your children and that's
30:35
the thing I try to get across why don't you want the same thing for your children that you had you know that's your pitch yeah basically can I listen
30:43
to you do your thing sure Pam approached one of the tables where several women were sitting hello I
30:51
can tell everybody how are you guys I'm bringing a petition tonight to everybody
30:56
so this is to put on the for all arizonas you don't have to be a republican a Democrat or independent
31:02
it's for all women here tonight so if you want to sign us to put the law on
31:07
the books for us to have rights back and turn the rights back over so that we have rights for abortion so you only
31:14
have to be a registered Mojave voter so if anybody like to sign I have it
31:21
here gorgeous I need to get my glasses I can't see what exactly
31:27
when they pass the around the petition nobody's the group's ideological diversity became clear nobody judges
31:34
nobody that's right you have that right and everybody else should have the right too right okay I'll sign some signed
31:42
immediately you don't have to sorry some people passed and when
31:47
Caitlyn followed up with women in both groups their reasoning was both political and very
31:55
personal to me um killing any life is is against what I
32:01
believe it's your body you should have the right to choose is should have never
32:06
been taken away but if you're in the heat of passion and you spread your legs and you get frightened and then oh shoot
32:13
I didn't want that baby you know you gave up your right to control your whole
32:19
body once you have another baby in there we signed the paper for abortion
32:27
because of a granddaughter that was very sick during her
32:32
pregnancy bued C to years ago and the
32:37
doctor could not perform abortion the baby died inside over
32:45
before they could take it out and it's very sad I'm open that the abortion become
32:53
legal especially for [Music]
33:02
but their beliefs about abortion did sometimes aligned with the traditional partisan split on the issue but for a
33:10
number of women in this red pocket of a purple state that was not the case um
33:15
what's your name Judy nice to meet you I'm Kaitlin um so
33:21
when Pam came around with the petition what did you do signed can you tell me
33:26
why because I believe woman should have the right to an abortion or not is there
33:35
a political party that you identify with the most Republican I'm 100% for Donald Trump and
33:42
I think Joe Biden has done everything he could to ruin our country are you planning on voting in
33:49
November oh yes um do do you feel in line with your
33:55
party on abortion no no I I don't look at it politically I
34:04
look at it as a woman and you know even if
34:10
the Democrats are for and Republicans aren that doesn't sway my
34:17
opinion thank you so much for talking to me I really appreciate it and done thank
34:23
you and can I ask you all my questions now you could ask me question but I
34:28
don't like to talk about politics can you introduce yourself my name is gailan Maxim um so when the signature page came
34:36
around what did you do I signed it because I think it's um women should be
34:42
able to make a choice whether they can get an abortion or not I don't think that the government should be telling
34:48
them they can't and it's against the law yeah is there a political party that you
34:54
identify with you know I'm signed up Democrat but normally if I vote I vote for what I
35:01
feel is right I don't always go along with a Democrat no are you planning on
35:07
voting in November do you think you will um yeah I need to vote because you know
35:13
every every vote counts so yes do you know who you would vote for at this point you know what I'm going to vote
35:19
for other stuff but I don't think I'm going to vote for a president because I don't want either one so if abortion
35:26
does get on the ballot do you think you would vote on that issue yes I would
35:31
thank you so much you're welcome thank you the last person she talked to Sherry
35:39
Sherry it's nice to meet you kayin hi was a woman named Sher I'm not against
35:44
it because I feel that you should have a choice it's your body and
35:51
um I would hope that they would use good common sense and do it because there's a
35:56
reason to do it not just because oh I don't want a baby it's just so hard to
36:02
say because you're not in that person's life you know you don't know what all the circumstances are we can
36:08
sit here and say oh well she should do this this and this but you don't know is
36:13
there a political party that you identify with not really I just I really don't know I I look at both sides my one
36:20
son is very very liberal very liberal and um my husband's very conservative so
36:26
we don't you know talk too much about it do you usually vote I used to I didn't last year I'm
36:33
going to try to this year yeah what changed was there a thing that changed no just I think life just kind of got in
36:40
the way and the ballot came and then we had different address and I I need to do that I really do I know that um is there
36:48
an issue that's most important to you that's a big one that we're talking
36:54
about yes definitely and you know I don't know it's just there's so much
37:01
out there going on right now with you know the taxes and the this and the that
37:07
I I don't know I like to think I'm pretty liberal too but
37:13
um but then moving out here was kind of a a little change for us you know um
37:20
when you say abortion is a one that matters for you what do you look for in
37:26
a politician on a board like what do you believe about it and what are you hoping to see in your
37:31
government well I would hope he would put that like you said on the ballot where there's women's rights for one
37:37
thing that we have a choice but like I said you you don't know what someone's
37:42
going through and I hate to say oh yeah I'm pro-life and then stand there and say oh you know you shouldn't have done
37:47
that because it's got to be Choice it's your body you know and
37:55
um I was not married and I got pregnant and I went to plann Parenthood and I got
38:01
this wonderful lady and and I was not young so it wasn't like you know I can
38:06
handle this and I said I don't know what to do and she said it's your choice it's your body she said so you have to decide
38:14
and don't let him tell you you should do this this it's not happening to him and
38:19
I that always kind of stuck with me because it's so true I think that's what happens to women they their partner will
38:25
say we just can't do this you better go do that one that's wrong that's up to
38:30
her what did you do kept him yeah he's he travels all over the world just has a
38:37
Wonderful Life yeah and I'm so proud for him to do that and he makes a difference
38:42
being a teacher so um you know you got to they each individual is going to be
38:49
so different it could be their age they could be you know if they're 10 years
38:54
old or 12 years old yeah let's think about this in the quality of life that
39:00
that baby's going to have or the mama's going to have you
39:05
know if you had to choose between Trump and Biden do you know what you would
39:10
do that's a tough one I I try to listen
39:15
to both sides of it I guess I'd have to say Trump because he just
39:21
seems not even all his his what he stands for and some of the things he says are just really not what I would
39:27
think of but Biden just seems like to say it kind of old and I I just feel
39:34
like that's not good for our country
39:39
so do you feel like Trump is where you are on
39:44
abortion I don't follow him that much I almost feel like if it's on a
39:50
given [Laughter] day you know well to me that sounds good
39:56
today we're going to get this in and then tomorrow oh let's you know I'm going to change my mind I feel like he can be
40:02
very very uh edgy I guess is a good and so it seems like what you're
40:08
saying is like there's a world where in November you might vote for Trump and then you might also vote for this
40:13
abortion initiative yes that's true all right I think that's all I got
40:19
thank you so much for talking to me I have my ey thoughts on it but you know like I said it's
40:25
just I I don't know it's kind of hard but like she said our
40:31
women's rights and I think I like to think back in the day I would be one that would be out there really you know
40:36
holding my little stick up or whatever because women were and still are treated differently unfortunately and they'll
40:43
say oh no no you know no we are not equal we just aren't and and it shows
40:49
when it push comes to shove and it gets to are not [Music]
40:59
Sherry's experience speaks to why abortion rights attracts such a broad Coalition of
41:05
support and why the proposed ballot measure gives Democrats a unique opportunity to have one message that
41:13
both motivates its base and appeals to the other side still as the women of Bunko Club
41:22
illustrate support for abortion rights doesn't always translate to enthusiasm for the top of the ticket much less for
41:29
Joe Biden but there's another more subtle way that the presence of abortion rights
41:35
on the ballot could help Democrats Beyond driving turnout or
41:41
enthusiasm it serves as a constant reminder of Republican extremism considering it's Donald Trump
41:47
who got row overturned in the first place and the party is yet to figure out its own position on the
41:55
issue that's next week [Music]
42:11
that's the runner for Thursday June 13th 2024 and now the
42:18
rundown Arizona is one of many places where abortion access is top of mine in
42:24
2024 so I figured this week the down could zoom out a little to better
42:30
understand the broader landscape of abortion rights in the rest of the country and to do so I called on an
42:36
expert I'm Lisa Lair I'm a national political correspondent at the New York Times and I'm the author of a new book
42:42
called the fall of row in the rise of a new America my colleague Lisa Lair is a leading political reporter who focuses a
42:50
lot of her work and her new book on chronicling how abortion access has changed you know our book really looks
42:56
at what we call the final decade of the row era cuz that's when obviously this is a 50-year fight by the anti-abortion
43:03
movement but it's in that final decade that their efforts really start you know just increasing and intensifying and
43:10
then of course they hitch their star to Donald Trump and he gets three Supreme Court Justices and so we really got
43:17
behind the scenes on both the political and legal strategy that allowed uh their movement to accomplish this can you talk
43:24
me through just what the state of abortion Acts is and specifically how it relates to 2024
43:30
November well abortion has been restricted or banned and a little under half the country I believe it's about 21
43:38
states or so right now that's been going on since of course uh the Supreme Court ruling that got rid of row uh in some of
43:45
those States the banss are in current litigation so they're in the court system uh in some of those States
43:51
abortion is just completely banned places like Texas or Mississippi where it has been completely criminalized
43:57
those States cover the entire Southeast really and parts of the West and Biden
44:04
has promised of course he's made a central promise of his campaign to restore row uh saying he'll restore
44:11
Federal abortion rights that's something that's very hard to do it will require 60 votes in the Senate which it's
44:17
unlikely Democrats will have or uh upending the filibuster to do it which they also don't have the votes to have
44:23
to do so Democrats have really turned their attention and abortion right supporters to going state by state and
44:29
getting these ballot measures on the ballot and put in front of Voters and they've had some success so far with
44:35
those efforts yeah other states other than Arizona where abortion could matter this November is there anywhere else
44:41
where it's on the ballot quite literally so there's as many as a dozen states or so where they're considering getting
44:48
these things on the ballot and abortion rights supporters are trying to get these measures on the ballot a lot of
44:54
them are really in flux you know there's Court challenges to gting them on there's complicated processes every
44:59
state has different processes to get them on uh Arizona is certainly a central focus of the political world
45:06
because it's such a pivotal swing state and it has so many competitive races uh people are also pretty focused on
45:12
Florida um because that's historically although it's less of a swing state now it's historically been one and what some
45:19
uh Biden campaign folks have told me is those States also have outsized resonance beyond the politics of their
45:25
specific state because they think what the measures in those two states signal to voters as abortion bans and
45:32
restrictions are not just an issue in these very conservative places like Mississippi like Alabama uh there's
45:39
something that's a national issue and that's also impacting states that voters may not expect as much a place like
45:45
Arizona or Florida to have those kinds of laws got you it seems as if abortion is playing two roles for Democrats right
45:51
now it is both a tangible issue that has a very literal effect for voters and because it's been return to the state
45:58
they can message specifically about its impact on your lives and it also seems like it fits into like a kind of broader
46:04
messaging thing that they're doing painting Republicans as extreme and out of touch and it feels like for those
46:10
efforts abortion is also a critical piece yes and I think they've hit their stride in some ways on how they've
46:16
messaged it right what do you mean well for a long time Democrats talked about abortion as Healthcare and what the data
46:23
showed is that people really didn't see abortion as Healthcare they didn't think it was the same is going to get a root canal or whatever what they do see it as
46:30
and there's been a lot of like focus groups and polling and sort of political research on on this is an issue of
46:36
freedom of whether you have the right to control your body to control your family
46:42
to make decisions about your own you know personal choices and that's really the message that Democrats have embraced
46:48
just up and down the ballot and what we've seen at least in these you know sort of two test cases that we've had
46:54
since roell which of course were the 20 22 midterms in these gubernatorial races in 23 is that it's been a powerful
47:01
message for them and it's one that also cuts into sort of Republican messaging that they have tried to frame themselves
47:08
up as the party of freedom and Democrats can kind of cut into that a little bit here go it thanks so much we appreciate
47:15
