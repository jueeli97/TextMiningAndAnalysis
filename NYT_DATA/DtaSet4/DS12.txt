The Democrats' New Chance in Wisconsin


0:02
oh this is cute about two weeks ago my colleague Anna and I made our way to Loi Wisconsin
0:09
a small town of about 3,000 people just north of Madison home of suie who's
0:16
Susie yeah Susie the duck when we got there we walked down Main Street past
0:23
the Florest a sausage and meat market an antique store until we crossed the
0:30
Bridge with a metal Archway dedicated to Susie the duck in 1948 a country Mard
0:36
settled down in downtown Loi she laid her eggs in a masonry Flower Basket endearing herself to locals and visitors
0:43
who observed her brood named Susie by police chief will bruning's granddaughter our mascot's Fame spread
0:50
Susie Faithfully returned to her Flower Basket raising two clutches of eggs each year and attracting National media
0:56
attention over the years many Suzies have nested in this basket Loi still host an annual Susie the duck Festival
1:04
celebrating the famous foul who rests in the heart of Loi that's pretty cute yeah it's also a
1:11
nice way of saying the duck died yeah yeah yeah I was like many suies have up
1:17
I was like oh oh we're all Su suie is one draw to Loa which I've
1:24
now learned is how you pronounce it but the other one is how the town votes
1:30
Loi is in Columbia County Wisconsin a frequent Bell weather in this critical
1:35
Battleground state in 2008 and 2012 the county voted for Obama in 2016 it went for Trump and
1:44
in 2020 it did again but by just 517 votes or in other words the type of
1:52
close election that wisconsinites have come to expect in fact four out of the
1:57
last six presidential elections in Wisconsin have come down to less than a percentage
2:03
point and this year is expected to be similarly close but we're actually here for a
2:09
different reason the maps after more than a decade of Jerry Mander State Legislative districts that
2:17
have overwhelmingly favored Republicans newer fairer Maps were adopted earlier
2:22
this year breathing new life into State Democrats in the process so after months of hearing about
2:30
President Biden's problems motivating the Democratic base I wanted to come to Wisconsin to
2:37
check in on something that is driving enthusiasm further down the ballot in
2:42
the state that Democrats must win today how Wisconsin's fresh maps
2:49
have upended the state's political terrain and why that could be welcome news for President Biden come
2:55
November from The New York Times I'm estad hearnen this is the the run
3:00
[Music] up so here's the story about how the new
3:07
maps in Wisconsin came to be for more than a decade and as we
3:13
explored in one of the early episodes of the runup Wisconsin's legislative maps
3:18
have been rather creative all these different parts of the state they would draw these wonky weird lines there was a
3:24
the the T-Rex District that looked like a little dinosaur where the the mouth of the dinosaur was the place where the
3:30
Democrats lived that's the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic party Ben wickler the Z District in um in Walker County
3:38
that that looked like the letter Z because it was drawn to bring all the Democrats together and uh you know
3:44
prevent them from electing two- state representatives which is what they' done right before those Maps came in this was
3:49
not your normal political Jerry manter Wisconsin's new maps were so
3:55
one-sided that even though the state has a pretty equal share of Democrats and Republicans
4:01
Republicans locked in large majorities in the State Assembly and Senate which
4:06
they used to block public Healthcare expansion and restrict abortion access
4:11
in Wisconsin no matter what the government does we always know exactly who's going to control the state legislature here which means the power
4:18
of the pur and the power to write laws this year is when all that starts to [Music]
4:26
change well Wisconsin guess what we we did it we did
4:32
it that all started to change when liberals rallied to win an important state supreme court race Wisconsin
4:39
voters have made their voices [Applause] [Music]
4:45
heard they've chosen to reject partisan extremism in this state tipping the
4:52
balance toward Progressive justices and in that moment it became clear that
4:57
democracy could actually be born in our state and with that new majority the
5:03
state supreme court quickly moved to call the legislative Maps unconstitutional and order new
5:09
ones so in January of this year the state's Democratic governor Tony iers
5:15
Drew new maps then they were approved by Republicans in the legislature today is
5:22
a day that I believe will Define our state's future and E signed them into law in February we have a once in
5:29
generation Big Bang moment to go from near super majorities in both legislative Chambers to a chance to win
5:36
our State Assembly majority and move towards a senate majority over the next two cycles immediately the new maps
5:42
opened opportunities for Democrats across the state in towns like oair and
5:48
Appleton but also in rural areas too suddenly they're purple just like the actual populus is and that means in
5:55
northwest southeast Central Wisconsin you could have these these patches of blue open up we're right now at the Sea
6:00
of red which is the reason I came to Loi Loi and the 14th Senate District is
6:08
essential to ever getting a democratic majority in the state senate because despite all the
6:15
excitement about what these new maps could mean for Democrats there's still a pretty significant political challenge
6:21
here for years Democrats have lost ground in rural communities both in
6:26
Wisconsin and across the country which is help fuel the perception that the party is out of
6:36
touch Hi how are you so a nice to meet you oh it's nice to meet you but I'm not
6:41
sure that description fit Sarah keski the first time political candidate
6:47
Democrats recruited to run in the all important newly competitive 14th Senate District in Loi how's it going um I'm
6:55
wildly nervous but I'm really excited to no don't be don't be we're just here to hang out yeah no we just have we just
7:01
have to bring the fancy mic so we can hear you up uh thank you for let Sarah's the daughter of a Dairy Farmer mom of
7:07
six really exced she also is a mental health counselor we actually talked to her in her therapy office therapy on
7:13
Zoom this is much better yes yes I you know I do um share
7:19
more in this room Sarah grew up in a town of about 800 people not too far
7:25
from Loi my graduating class was about 49 people um um grew up on a dairy farm
7:31
there and with four siblings and the community was really richly rural um it
7:38
was we were very steeped into our Lutheran um background so there was a
7:45
lot of neighbors that went to the same church this small little church up on a hill and so we just you know did a lot
7:52
with with that after spending time in some bigger cities she moved here to raise her family and started Counseling
7:59
in Lo and I really didn't know if it would work cuz it's such a small town but I
8:04
really believe in having people have access right to to what they need for
8:11
care and so I opened this practice in 2018 and was fortunate enough that it
8:18
was successful I wanted to understand how Sarah went from therapist to political candidate why Democrats often
8:25
struggle in rural communities and how she plans to pitch herself in a race of such critical importance
8:32
turns out her entry to politics was recent politics became something on my
8:39
radar for me personally uh less than N9 months ago wow yeah so during covid
8:48
um being a therapist ended up being very heavy I would say it
8:55
was I'm surprised they ended up I mean I imagined it as a heavy yeah you know I've done it for so long
9:01
that I I find it very invigorating I love doing what I do but it was the
9:07
first time that I really felt drained deeply drained by
9:12
the work I was doing and I wasn't sure like how to manage that honestly um and
9:20
so as I've said to people nobody wants a depressed therapist so I had to figure out how do I take care of me and for me
9:28
what I found along the way was a great quote and then a a passion project basically the quote
9:36
was action is the antidote to despair by Joan bz and that really helped me to go
9:44
that's what I need to do is I need to activate this distress I have into something that
9:50
feels meaningful Sarah took that J by as inspiration and helped start a nonprofit
9:56
focused on a day of service in Loa was called lift Loi and I just said hey who
10:02
would be willing to volunteer let's work on uplifting our community by putting bark under the um
10:12
swing sets it was cleaning the windows of the library it was um raking a
10:17
neighbor's lawn doing that kind of stuff because service I think is really empowering and it gives us a sense of
10:24
like something bigger than ourselves it's very healing lift Loa is a hit in town
10:29
and after that a neighbor encouraged her to run for State Assembly which at the
10:35
time was a really tough race to win they said you know what what'll help is you'll get your name on the ballot um
10:42
really really really hard to win but you can help up ticket and you can get a message out there a progressive message
10:48
about what really matters but as we now know the maps changed and with it Loi and the
10:55
surrounding areas weren't quite as hard for Democrats to win anymore which for most political candidates
11:02
would have been incredible news those new maps changed the um District that I
11:09
was in from a plus 18 Republican to a plus 16
11:15
Democrat and honestly that it lost some of its um pull for me
11:24
because I thought then well other people are going to be willing to run because you can get that
11:30
and I had heard that there was somebody that was really interested in running and so there'd be a primary and I was really interested in not necessarily
11:37
needing to do that and so I was actually um contemplating and talking to people about maybe bowing out and just
11:43
endorsing that person and to be clear the part of it that was less appealing to you was that you was what well you
11:51
didn't want to run against other Democrats not really um I thought that seems like a little bit of a waste of
11:57
resources um I also thought the new map the district was a little less Rural and
12:04
for me rural is my heart and so while I love um the other area it just was it
12:11
wasn't as compelling to me I didn't feel like I was as needed so wouldn't I I
12:18
have an energy that if I'm passionate about something I can do lots but I'm not passionate about it like you know my
12:25
heart's not in it and so I I kind of just didn't feel like my heart was as in it just when she was thinking about getting out of the race I got a call um
12:32
from two senators her phone rang and I said and I talked to them and I said to
12:38
them I said I love that you're you know asking me I said but I need to know like
12:44
why and the fact that I don't have to change because I I don't want to change I want
12:51
to be able to be myself I don't I don't want to be a cookie cutter politician that just doesn't I'm I'm too old to be
12:58
other than who I am and they said no like Sarah that's actually what we want we want you to just be you we believe that you have the
13:04
right um care for your community and then we talked about well you know some of the things that are important to me
13:11
and what it would mean to be a senator and having then you know maybe being able to flip the um the Senate uh in
13:19
2026 and the fact that maybe then we could have Universal meals for children
13:24
for in school maybe we could have better access to Mental Health Services maybe we could have and all of a sudden like
13:30
everything in me felt like okay if this is what I'm needed to do now this is what I'll do because it feels that
13:36
important you mentioned um the issues that got you motivated I I I see the through line between starting the things
13:41
like the nonprofit I guess considering how recently your lens turned to politics how did you go about finding
13:49
policy issues that you most cared about and what are the specific ones that you
13:54
would say your campaign is housed then mhm well part of it is reflection and I'll
14:02
say when I started my practice one of the things I did was what's called a values assessment and when I did that
14:09
the values that came to the surface were
14:14
contribution compassion and moral courage and so shifting into politics
14:20
then is really about compassion well compassion to me is all about how do we
14:25
serve one another how do we make sure that the least of those um are served
14:31
well so Medicaid expansion for example is really important to me to make sure that everybody has access um to to
14:40
Health Care um improve mental health um care access rural economies are really
14:47
important to me making sure that we have small businesses that are um supported in our rural communities they are the
14:54
life of a town public school funding is hugely important
14:59
women have the right to make decisions about their body and have autonomy um
15:05
for their Healthcare decisions um so Reproductive Rights are important um so
15:11
I guess all of those things are just things that are important and then they translate ultimately into legislation
15:17
how is the brand of the democratic party in rural communities right if you think about Wisconsin I mean I know we know
15:24
through numbers it's become increasingly Urban of a party there's been less and less Democrat representing rural
15:30
communities and the bottom is kind of falling off for some of the folks when you look at the national level when you
15:36
say I'm a Democrat and you're in a place that's overwhelmingly Republican what's the response
15:42
it's not necessarily positive um
15:49
but I think if I can connect with the things value-wise that are important
15:57
right making sure that we support one another making sure that there's not too
16:04
much government interference like having a say over our bodies um making sure
16:11
that we support small businesses so that we can uplift our communities um but can
16:18
you diagnose for me like what do you think went wrong for Democrats and ryal communities because they used to do better in plac like C yeah I think that
16:25
there's a lot of disinformation I think although though I think there is also some truth to um there's
16:33
been you know an an Elite Class if you will that they'll talk about that I don't think is necessarily inaccurate
16:41
either um so I think it has been maybe leaned um away from some of those
16:50
Central ideals um but I also think more of it is disinformation honestly MH I
16:57
hear you I I remember like you know talking to Wisconsin Democrats over the last8 years or so and it was so defined
17:04
by this feeling that when you looked at the Madison and Milwaukee and surrounding areas that was functionally
17:11
growing into further and further apart from other parts of the state like I now
17:17
see the possibility with these maps and maybe that was so overblown like maybe the reason that there was such of that
17:23
split was because you know there were literally Maps drawn so that people couldn't have you would see yeah they do
17:29
that so I guess I'm curious like how should how how real do you think um a
17:36
state that has become politically known for its Urban rural kind of split how real do you think that split is as
17:41
someone who kind of sits at an intersection of some of those things well I live in a small town I have a lot
17:48
of small town friends and I have a lot of Democrats as friends so I know that there's a lot of people in rural areas
17:56
that share my same values so so um I don't think it's nearly as uh clearcut
18:03
as what it looks like with the maps so I think it's it's going to be very
18:08
interesting I think there's a lot of purple um and I think some people that were historically maybe even read um
18:16
will probably lean uh toward something different this this election MH it does
18:23
feel like there's a little energy among Democrats in the state now but it's not like we hear energy around this election
18:28
broadly you know like I we travel across the country specific to 2024 and so much
18:34
of what we hear is the opposite is apathy I don't like the candidates I don't want to get involved I I want to
18:39
actually ignore this race and I know that there are ways that when you localize the issues you can talk to
18:45
people more specifically but I guess I was just curious for to flip it the other way for a second like when you
18:51
look nationally are you do like Donald Trump versus Joe Biden again
18:57
like is it hard to create energy with such familiarity at the top of the ticket um so I will say that um I'm very
19:07
clear that Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee is an imperfect person and there
19:14
are some things particularly around Gaza that are concerning to me but I feel
19:22
very good about what he's done I feel like he's done such important work um
19:27
with the infrastructure bill with the chips and science act um that that when
19:33
I look at what he's accomplished to me it's kind of a no-brainer to say oh my
19:38
gosh let's do more of that you have been incredible in that role and the other
19:44
day I was listening to um a woman who is a Native American and she um she made a
19:50
good point she said you know in our culture we really respect Elders we respect that they have a knowledge um
19:57
from living along life and I feel like in some ways we're wanting sort of
20:03
entertainment but I you know I think that is something that we really need to consider is this respect for this wisdom
20:11
that is a through line because of his experience and because of his age and
20:17
and life experience and I think you know we can get beyond the numbers a bit and just see what he's done what he's
20:23
capable of doing and who he is as a man I feel really excited that he's going to is that what you hear when you talk to
20:29
people um that's what I hear when I talk to myself that's what I share with other people I guess I guess I'm asking like
20:35
in the energy sense in the community sense um I would say I would say that there's some of
20:42
that right in the in the Democratic um party I would say not globally locally
20:49
but again I think that's the message that just needs to get out there then and so it is about getting energized to
20:55
present this other narrative that's I think is valid I think it's really
21:00
viable um so hopefully there will be more energizing of it um with many of us
21:06
bringing it to the Forefront yeah yeah thanks for your this was really no this was great I hope you I don't know it
21:13
ended up being okay oh of course of course don't know after the break we go
21:19
door to door with Sarah to test just how far this down ballot energy might
21:24
extend also The Man Behind the new maps Wisconsin's
21:31
Governor so we're going to does anyone need a clip I do please give you this
21:37
one hi all as we were speaking with Sarah a small group of volunteers gathered
21:43
outside her office are we all taking two sheets or are we all taking one I took two I think two is better the Signature
21:51
Collection period for State Cate candidates had just opened and Sarah needed 400 signatures to get on the
21:58
ballot how do people uh feel about braving the rain a little bit fine it's not that
22:03
many drops they're not very I think the person these volunteers were eager to
22:10
get started despite the winds and increasingly stormy skies did you make
22:15
that I yeah I did I just can you describe what it is for the audio so this is a map with the three assembly
22:24
seats that make up the 14th senate seat with each of the townships Villages and
22:29
cities mapped out on it so that because the maps have changed not everybody knows which district they're in so this
22:36
is just uh when they say I'm not in that District I can say yes you are right
22:41
there how long we tagged along with Sarah oh my look at this WEA
22:47
okay and walked up the street away from downtown Loa into a pretty classic Small
22:52
Town neighborhood this porch is so cool I love wrap around porches amazing I
22:58
love them filled with old Victorian houses and sprawling
23:04
yards are you David yes I am hi David my name is Sarah keski and I'm running for
23:10
local state senate um district 14 most of these voters were Democrats who voted
23:15
for Joe Biden in 2020 so I was interested in their support for Sarah but also how they were
23:21
thinking about the relationship between the seat she's running for and the top of the ticket
23:30
God what are you doing I'm a hot mess the first person we asked was a familiar
23:35
face for Sarah Sarah her friend Stephanie if you would would you please
23:41
sign and her son Fred oh my gosh I would love to do you know what this is um no
23:47
it's a microphone who was very curious about our microphone can I try yeah you want to
23:53
try Fred held the mic as we asked Stephanie about her vote well in the down ballot is really at the bottom line
24:00
and Le at least in my like limited time as a voter I feel like is what has the
24:07
most significant impact on like my dayto and especially as a parent on my day-to-day life it's definitely the
24:12
first time like I'm like not enthusiastic you know about especially around the the stop that the
24:18
presidential election why is that um I really liked Biden a while ago and
24:26
not that I don't like him anymore you know what I mean but I um yeah I think my my struggle is a lot around foreign
24:35
policy decisions being made feeling better about Biden before the kind of last six months post October yes for
24:42
sure you yes yeah for sure um I I did not like I never stood behind the the
24:49
agist kind of perspective because both candidates are old right would I would I prefer to have a candidate that's closer
24:54
to my age as a as a millennial for sure right but it's not the world we live in so sometimes you have to navigate the
25:01
world you live in and prior to what happened 6 months ago I wouldn't say I
25:06
was excited but I was more accepting of it so like um when we voted in the
25:12
recent election um my husband and I neither one of us voted for Biden right
25:17
we did the the um the protest vote essentially now we will vote for Biden
25:23
in the election but I wanted to send a message that I did not
25:28
I did not think that the way he was handling US policy around Israel and Palestine was appropriate so I mean that
25:37
had a little bit of impact I think right like he you know Biden talked to Netanyahu and and came down a little
25:43
more forcefully than he had in the past so that that's that yeah hopefully it does make a difference but what I'm
25:50
really excited about is my local elections and who I'm voting for and who I'm going to put sign who who are you
25:57
Sarah ski she's the best I love you this is so oh my God you
26:08
guys at this point the storm was starting to set in hi there don't get
26:14
blown away I was looking for Diane but lucky for us we met Dan and Diane why don't
26:21
you just come in you mind I don't want you blown away so a gracious couple who led us into their home to escape the
26:27
weather welcome to Wisconsin thank you thank you for welc us to your home it's so beautiful know old Victorian you know
26:34
yes I'm like I don't get to see these kind of houses very often and now they're inviting me in I love it thank
26:40
you if you don't yeah so would you mind also signing nominations papers thank you so much have you all always been in
26:47
this area um since 1979 been in the loai area yes my kids
26:54
went to school here I raised them here my late husband was was the chief of police
26:59
here and uh I actually reconnected with uh someone I went to high school with at
27:05
a class reunion and we got married 12 years ago oh what a lovely story and I
27:10
took her to the dark side he was he is a retired firefighter and param and you're from
27:17
loai no I was actually from um I lived in a few different communities so I
27:23
worked for the city of wossa and uh I I had 32 years there and I was teaching
27:29
EMS uh for 37 years with the school system down in Milwaukee so you know one
27:34
of the things that's been really important to me is first responder mental health it's big it's big it is
27:41
and I've been talking to the chief of police a bit about that over the last couple of years and then I've had some
27:46
people that work um EMS as clients and I just feel like that's an issue that is really not well understood or addressed
27:56
um and so wanting yeah should be yeah can I ask a political question oh yeah
28:01
sure um I'm curious just how you all feel about this election can you just describe if you think to November an
28:06
election day like what's the emotion that comes to your mind wow that's a loaded question I
28:12
would I would have to say that I am afraid that the people in the United
28:17
States today have forgotten our history and what has happened in the years past
28:23
and what caused us to go into World War II I'm I'm not ashamed to say that I
28:28
think Trump is a modern-day Hitler I think that he will take our
28:34
country down a road if he gets elected that we don't want to see we experienced
28:40
it once before and I don't ever want to see it happen again and if he gets in
28:46
again I'm I'm really afraid of what's going to happen to this country Wisconsin hold such an important
28:53
role obviously in the election so I'm sure around you there's Trump supporters
28:58
I'm sure your friends your your people around you how do you how has that affected or it hasn't affected any
29:05
personal relationships because you feel so strongly about the stakes here but I'm sure you also know people who love
29:10
him we don't talk about it it's it's created a lot of problems with families
29:16
it's created a lot of problems with neighbors um the society that we live in right now I feel bad for the younger
29:23
people because it's a very hateful Society it's all about
29:28
me we're fortunate we have a couple to answer your question a couple neighbors that work well with us but we really
29:35
don't get into those subject matters because we know who our even our family members are close ones that are on one
29:43
side as opposed to the other you know I'm I'm worried about I I don't understand how women can vote for uh
29:50
Trump because of his history and uh they do you know he's very forceful in how he
29:55
presents himself the biggest thing that bothers me in politics is even bigger
30:01
than that it has to do with age we have two guys that are closing in an 80 years old they're running our country why why
30:09
can't we get younger people in those positions when I speak of younger they have to be seasoned they have to be
30:15
somebody that has to be maybe give or take 50 60 years old that have visions
30:20
for the future you know do these older politicians have visions for the future
30:27
or how much money they put in their pockets and I'm talking about both sides of that fence does B age worry you as it
30:32
worries him it worries me because if something should happen to him in office Camila would come in as the next
30:39
president I don't know that she's totally qualified for it but I think it is time for a woman to come into office
30:46
I think when I look around the world the number of female world leaders far
30:53
surpasses what anyone would ever expect and I think the United States is far
30:58
behind in that aspect of things and giving women the credit that they're due
31:04
can I just ask what what bothers what makes you unsure that she's
31:10
qualified just listening to her um I can't put a specific on it because I
31:17
don't honestly know all of her background but when I listen to how she
31:23
delivers her speeches how she delivers responses to question
31:28
questions it makes me wonder if she's seasoned enough to take on that Dynamic
31:35
role and I could be totally wrong because she could come in and her confidence level could go from here you
31:42
know off the roof and that's what we need for any leader that would come in
31:48
if something were to happen to Bon I think she's she's a good support
31:56
person in the role that she's in I think she's in a good position for what she's
32:01
got in 2016 I remember people who I went to Marquette Milwaukee so I have some friends who are still in Wisconsin and I
32:07
remember in 2016 people telling me like I don't know about these polls things feel like Trump is kind of more popular
32:14
here than people are saying and I remember in 2020 a kind of opposite feeling that people were feeling like I
32:19
don't know like maybe he would lose do you have any feelings right now when you are people talking about the election do
32:25
you think do you have any sense from your neighbors or your community um how people are feeling about the
32:32
candidates I'm going to say no for this area right now I haven't even communicated with any anybody about it I
32:40
was disappointed that President Biden chose to run again again I'm the age guy you know I I think we need camil even
32:48
she ran herself you know with a a different vice president person whatever
32:53
however it would have played out uh from what I'm seeing is it's been
32:58
silent PE neighbors don't want to talk about it family members don't want to talk about
33:04
it the I hate to say it my personal family members that are Trump
33:09
supporters they don't hesitate you know bring on the guns bring on this let's fight him let's get him you know it's
33:17
that kind of concept and my son is a trump supporter yeah and mine was how
33:23
could you be a trump supporter I I don't understand it I raised you better than
33:28
that but I mean that's we have in the past and we came to the conclusion that
33:35
we were at an impass and there would have been no change I mean he was actually going out and buying uh weapons
33:42
of mass destruction I would say because he was going to be ready and I'm like ready for what and that's not us in
33:48
general people have gotten this mentality thank you all so I mean I'm sorry I was I wasy cut it up I was just
33:55
going to thank you all I think that was really helpful partially because you know we're trying to ask people
34:00
about how it feels locally for them and um because as we travel you can tell
34:06
people tuning in to this election for the first time and to your point some folks trying to block it out um and so
34:12
you know this is helpful to hear how people are interacting with it within their families within their communities
34:18
I hope they're smart like they were the last
34:23
time and you know where I'm going with that I you know I again I I know I don't
34:29
like to see President Biden at his age being in a position but I'd rather he
34:35
was rather absolutely well thank you much this has been just such a pleasure
34:40
I hope to meet you nice to meet youall thank you me thank you all so much thank
34:47
you here's what happened next those dark clouds turned into a massive
34:53
thunderstorm which temporarily trapped all of us in Dan and Diane's house
34:58
Anna and I eventually got back to Madison where we continued our checkup on Democratic
35:03
enthusiasm both at the top of the ticket and in down ballot races like
35:09
Sarah's which led us to a conference room right across from the state capital always walk around down with
35:18
this hi nice to meet you we met Governor Tony iers the architect of the State's
35:25
new maps grad iers was first elected in 2018 narrowly defeating Scott Walker the
35:31
Wisconsin Republican who had been Governor since 2011 and ushered in the era of conservative dominance thanks in
35:38
large part to the maps thank you um we're are outside the capital here and um one of the things we
35:46
wanted to do is talk to you about the change in the legislative maps that happened and for the last you know
35:52
decade or so it's been so defined by the Jerry Mander that's limited Democratic power in this State before we get to
35:58
what's changed now can you just tell me what it was like to be a democrat in Wisconsin at a time when you know I
36:04
think the political sense was that Democrats couldn't do much right yeah it
36:10
was kind of a dark time here in the state because you know we have a
36:16
progressive history here with you know Gaylord Nelson and and prox Meer and
36:22
lots of others that uh preceded me in in the in the in these positions and you
36:28
know whether it's environment or anything else and then suddenly the uh the right wave came through and uh took
36:36
care of issues of let's bust unions let's cut things for schools and frankly
36:43
that just wasn't consistent with uh my worldview and a lot of other people's
36:49
worldview and we we had to we had to make that change so that we you know we have to be honest we're a purple State
36:56
we're not a red State we're not a blue State we're a purple State and our legislative actions and and before I
37:03
became Governor uh the actions of the executive B Branch uh certainly didn't
37:09
reflect that and so we we felt uh with the new maps we were in a much better
37:15
place to uh do the work of the people what does it mean tangibly for these new maps how will that translate to policy
37:21
in this legislative session and going for oh it's going to have a huge I'm spending most of my my time outside of
37:28
being a governor raising money for the these folks that are going to be running for office for the first time any of
37:34
them but yes absolutely I think we can get all sorts of things done with uh Fair Maps what we're we've never taken
37:41
uh Medicaid expansion here in the state of Wisconsin I'm sure were I think maybe 10 states the rest of them all real red
37:50
that have not taken that and and we we as a result of that uh our Health Care system is nowhere near where we want it
37:57
to be uh especially for you know people that struggle mightily in in this state
38:03
so that is a just a good Common Sense issue that uh uh that we can work on uh
38:11
together frankly with uh with more Democrats in the legislature it's a numers thing yeah
38:17
yeah it creates a different level of possibility for you as governor also you know we were canvasing out in Loi
38:23
yesterday and one of the things that came up was how the maps kind of reinforced the sense of urban rural
38:28
divide in the state partially because uh uh it made Democrats unable to win in
38:35
some of those rural areas that they now have opportunities for but something that also came up was a kind of sense
38:41
that the Democrats had a bad brand in those rural communities I wanted to know what you thought about that like do you
38:47
think the Democratic brand needs some work in maybe places where Democrats weren't able to run or weren't
38:53
competitive previously yeah and and I I guess some of that is with with the Democrats not having a great chance to
39:00
represent those areas too they're hearing what Democrats and Moy and Madison are talking about which may
39:07
frankly not have much to do with what's happening in in rur Wisconsin so yes
39:14
finding ways to deal with issues whether it's agriculture issues whether it's
39:19
roads infrastructure things like that uh yeah that's what we have to that's what we have to focus on we have frankly
39:26
since I've been governor so I am jazzed about the future we can we're going to be able to get some things done that we
39:32
frankly haven't you know I wanted to talk about the national race too because Wisconsin uniquely obviously sits an
39:38
important place in the Electoral College also part of this Democratic blue wall That's often talked about where the presidential race will likely come
39:44
through Wisconsin Michigan uh where am I Pennsylvania right um just on from as
39:52
the governor like what do you think this race will come down to Biden won by 21,000 votes last time four out of the
39:57
last six presidential races in Wisconsin won by less than the percentage point do you expect it to be that close again yes
40:03
absolutely there's there's nothing to lead me to believe otherwise it'll be a close race and I think Biden will win
40:11
but um uh yeah it'll be close we are purple State and uh uh our purple list
40:18
uh will will be evident but but I also believe that our work uh to create uh
40:25
new maps and have new leg legislators and and more democratic legislators just
40:31
to essentially reflect what Wisconsin is that'll bring out more people and more
40:36
Democrats and I think that will help not only Joe Biden and KL Harris I think it'll help uh Tammy Baldwin and and
40:44
others that are running for office uh people are fired up you know and you know what's happening on the national
40:51
stage whether it's about abortion or democracy all those things play a role here in Wisconsin too
40:57
and uh so I think it'll be a good turn on to people it could be could be record
41:03
breaking it seems like we're kind of flipping the scri we usually talk about the top of the ticket having the tail down ballot it sounds like you're
41:08
talking about down ballot actually fueling the top that's our hope you know what's what's good for goose is for the
41:16
gander it's good for the goose or vice versa I'm not sure which that is but the uh uh the yeah they help us we help them
41:26
you know we've seen Biden certainly come to Wisconsin and prioritize the state
41:31
with a kind of recognition of its importance in November do any I I know it's still six seven months out I know
41:37
it's going to be close here but do any of this kind of like polling bad approval ratings like any of that type
41:43
of um what I think is conation from National Democrats how do you feel about
41:49
the state where it might come down to our Democrats is in trouble no different
41:55
no different than it has been last two last two elections no I I I think uh
42:01
with the President visiting here often and the vice president also and frankly I think Donald Trump coming here often
42:08
uh is okay too I mean what do you mean his his his stuff is way out there and I
42:16
and I think uh uh some of the things that he talks about even moderate Republicans a gasp and so having him
42:23
around is is good you think the backlash helps you all sure um in on you know
42:32
yesterday we were out in low d as I was saying that's a home of D Susie the duck by the way we learned about Susie the
42:38
duck I actually had no we had no idea uh about Susie's Fame but it had a real
42:44
crash course in Susie the that's Wisconsin but when we were on the doors
42:49
people were pretty um even though there was excitement about the down ballot as you mentioned and the ability to elect
42:55
new Democrats we heard a lot about Biden's age we heard a lot about Gaza we
43:01
heard a lot of folks saying they wish they had other options sure as the Democrat Governor of the state do you
43:08
have to speak to those concerns directly sure you know age is always an issue and uh you know I'm getting up there myself
43:15
so but I I'll tell you I just you know people might say yeah I'd like to have somebody younger well that's not a
43:22
choice now you know it's Joe Biden is AG is and Trump's the age he is and they're
43:29
the they're the two the choices are Stark differently we are in a good place
43:35
as a state to move forward and let's let's get it going I will say Gaza is an
43:40
issue it's going to continue to be an issue obviously there's no there's probably nothing more fluid than what's
43:47
going on in the Middle East and that does this play out the way it plays out I'm I'm not saying that people aren't um
43:55
uh they shouldn't have those you know concerns because I do too everybody does you see all these little kids getting
44:03
murdered frankly uh is not a site that uh anybody wants to see but at the end
44:09
of the day we're voting for presidency of the United States these are the two main candidates and we got to get behind
44:16
Biden and we got to make sure that we have a democratic legislature you know you talk about this
44:23
being a purple State uh and the fact you think like you know Republicans and Trump actually aren't reflecting that
44:28
because of how um how extreme you're saying they are does any do you have to
44:33
keep Democrats in check too like I'm saying isn't is there an opposite version here is there a version of the
44:39
party that becomes too blue yeah well yes I think there is and uh some
44:45
Democrats May disagree with me on this but I I believe that as a purple state
44:51
that we and after this next election the um the middle
44:57
becomes much larger on both sides and I think what do you mean by that that uh
45:04
more moderates on both sides than ever before you think we'll this November will produce that yes okay yeah no
45:10
question in my mind I think was you know are there are there really good liberals and very some very good very
45:18
conservative people yes but most people are live their lives in the middle and
45:24
uh and that's that's a reflection of a purple and I think that means that we can get things accomplished you know
45:31
small thing marijuana I believe strongly it'll be um uh legal here in the state
45:38
of Wisconsin because there's a whole bunch of moderate Republicans that feel that way and a whole bunch of moderate
45:46
uh Democrats so we can we can get that done is that the major thing absolutely not but that's just a good example of
45:53
where I see the middle ground being a good place to be I mean I I see how the
45:59
I I see how you can make that case on the state level yeah is what a you know is it a problem that that's a harder
46:06
case to make on a national level oh hell yes but but I think deep down most people are that way I mean I think what
46:13
you hear many times on a national level is that oh my gosh uh comp complaining
46:21
about you know why can't people get together why can't people do this together it's usually because the issues
46:28
are so polarized that uh uh it doesn't get accomplished well frankly there's a
46:35
lot of money at either end so yes I think it's harder at the national level but uh let's let's say this let's let
46:42
the U States uh show how we can do it the post November with more moderates do
46:48
you use that veto power less do you expect to be like you know like I I was seeing how like you know you it's been
46:56
kind of synonymous with you kind of using that veto power because of the Republican legislature as it changes do
47:02
you expect that to change yes yes to yeah that's not a great way to govern I
47:07
mean do I take that job seriously hell yes but no that's I would anticipate
47:14
vetoing you know minimal half 50% of what I do now and could be that it just
47:22
never comes to my desk because the moderates will say well H we we're not
47:27
there mhm the moderate future to come yeah thank you I really appreciate your time thank you so much Governor thank
47:33
you so you've heard about Susie the duck we have we have we literally home of
47:38
Susie the duck and I had not and I and we heard about the Futures the suie
47:45
lineage um we did um a episode about the Jerry
47:51
Mander when we were first starting partially because when I was in school I remember it being such a formative thing
47:56
learned about political power like I I you know it was as kind of the protests
48:02
were happening here during Walker and I remember being in Milwaukee and just feeling like more than D or R the thing
48:10
that I want to tell these people is not like they're written out of the process you know like and so it became this thing I kind of got obsessed with and so
48:16
it's I Like That We're looping back around now to talk about I mentioned this to the governor
48:24
and a few people we met in Loi but because I spent so much time in Wisconsin during the days of the old
48:31
Maps coming back now feels like a full circle moment a story about political
48:37
power representation and what's possible when the political system more closely
48:42
reflects the people but there's also an electoral takeaway here's state democratic chair
48:49
Ben wickler again on how enthusiasm for state and local races in Wisconsin could
48:55
make up for the lack of enthusiasm that some Democrats feel for President Biden Wisconsin elections are decided by
49:02
a couple of votes per Precinct around the state and that means that if you have a candidate for State Legislature
49:09
who inspires a few hundred people to vote who might not otherwise have done so that person could help tip the entire
49:14
presidential election in the state that could tip the entire country and that means that this idea of reverse coat
49:21
tales that a down ballot candidate can help an up ballot candidate win it could
49:26
really change the history of our country in Wisconsin in this year this is not a year if you read all the polls
49:32
characterized by white hot levels of voter enthusiasm in the presidential race but in State Legislative races
49:40
there are a bunch of people who are furious at their Republican representatives and those voters now if
49:45
they get together they can turn out and they can flip a district that flips the state and that could flip the presidential race 2
49:58
[Music]
50:16
that's the runner for Thursday May 2nd 2024 now the rundown we're into week
50:22
three of Donald Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan on Wednesday morning our colleague Jonah bramwit who's been
50:29
reporting on the trial called us up starting with one big development Donald
50:34
Trump has been held in criminal contempt that's a really really big deal he's also been fined
50:39
$9,000 but let's put aside the fine for a second and just talk about what means to be held in contempt it means that
50:46
he's disobeyed the court and in fact flouted the law in March the judge imposed a gag order that bars Trump from
50:52
attacking Witnesses jurors and various other people involved in the case the
50:58
judge found that Trump had violated this order nine separate times thus the $9,000 penalty $1,000 for each time he
51:05
violated it and it prompted the judge to warn him that if he continues to disobey
51:11
he could be sent to jail so what we have in front of us is the possibility that
51:18
one of the most powerful people in the world who was the commander in chief who is now under the thumb of a New York
51:23
state court trial judge could be sent to jail by that judge if he continues to do
51:29
what he frequently does which is disobey orders and lash out at his adversaries whether real or
51:35
perceived other than Trump having been held in contempt we also have the trial proper in which Witnesses testify we
51:43
have what I would call tent pole Witnesses those are the witnesses who are going to help unspool the narrative
51:48
in a major way and who are going to get firm cross-examination by the defense so
51:54
far we've had six Witnesses overall but we've only had two tent pole Witnesses the first we talked about last
52:00
week that was David pecker the former publisher of the national inquir and what pecker said just to remind you is
52:07
that he had entered into a secret plot with Trump and Michael Cohen to suppress negative stories about Trump and thus
52:13
Aid him in the 2016 election and then on Tuesday we landed on our second tent
52:19
pole witness Keith Davidson Keith Davidson was a lawyer to Stormy Daniels he represented her in 2016 when she was
52:26
seeking to be paid for her story of having had sex with Donald Trump a story that Trump has always denied and
52:32
Davidson on Tuesday kind of took the Baton from David pecker he corroborated
52:39
some of the testimony but then moved us on to Stormy Daniels and as of Wednesday
52:44
when court is off where we are is that Michael Cohen in Davidson's telling back
52:50
in 2016 is just about to pay him the $130,000 of hush money that will keep
52:57
Stormy Daniels silent and the Trump campaign believes prosecutors say help
53:03
ease Trump's path to the White House Jonah also updated us on how Trump
53:08
appears to be taking all this I mean we've seen emotion radiating from Trump in the courtroom we've seen him glow
53:14
we've seen him glare we've seen him shake his head we've seen him look disgusted the other thing he does is he
53:19
closes his eyes a lot what it may be happening is that people in Trump's orbit say he closes his eyes when he's
53:26
seeking to calm down and so it may be that this testimony is so enraging him and to be clear we're hearing testimony
53:32
about Trump having Affairs cheating hiding it from his wife Melania being cheap being Frugal and of course it's
53:40
making him mad also this week tensions escalated at
53:46
many college campuses across the country as demonstrators continued protesting
53:51
Israel's ongoing military campaign in Gaza at Columbia University in New York City City more than 100 students were
53:58
arrested after some demonstrators forcefully took over a campus Building
54:03
the White House also weighed in with White House spokesperson John Kirby saying the president believes that
54:10
forcefully taking over a building on campus is absolutely the wrong approach that is not an example of peaceful
54:17
protest there are 74 days until the Republican National Convention 109 days
54:23
until the Democratic National Convention and 187 days until the general election
