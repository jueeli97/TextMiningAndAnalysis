The 'Run-Up' Guide to Iowa


0:01
well we're in Iowa huh finally you know after Much Ado and buildup it's actually
0:08
real and so you know the primary has gone from being theoretical to tangible
0:13
and uh I think we're ready for it we're ready for it as a show as a country what
0:21
oh the show is more ready than the country I think actually the country is
0:27
completely unprepared for this year so I take solace in that like whenever people
0:32
are ready to like fully acknowledge the mess that is in front of us we have been
0:40
untangling it for long enough to be there to help them from the New York Times I'm estad
0:47
hearon with my colleague Anna Foley I'm legitimately shaking right now it's so
0:54
cold only when it hit-5 did I think that would be cold when it just had single
0:59
digits I was like yeah it's winter we're coming to you from De Mo Iowa where the
1:04
windchill today is - 38Â° I do think that there can be this
1:10
like Midwestern Supremacy around weather but we simply are built different no
1:16
like we are built different it's like it's is it built different or God complex like who knows I me one man's
1:23
built different is another man SC complex and this is a special caucus Day
1:29
episode of the run
1:34
up so one of the reasons that we're doing this episode on Monday right is to kind of give people who are listening
1:42
people who are maybe just like tuning in kind of an overview a study guide kind of of like what Iowa is going to be this
1:49
year yeah exactly like if you have been living your life and not thinking about the presidential election I think you
1:55
can wake up on Monday and be like whoa this is starting and what's happening
2:01
Mark and so you know one of the things we wanted to do was make sure there's something that can help you understand
2:06
this state and put this state in context with the rest of the race yeah so give
2:12
us kind of an overview of like what the field is looking like in Iowa specifically right now so you frankly
2:20
have three and a half candidates uh I would say Donald Trump is obviously the
2:26
front runner has been so for months on in right now polling puts him at about a 30p point advantage over any Challenger
2:33
and I think the central question for this uh iow caucus is around Trump's dominance is it as real in votes as it
2:40
has seemed to be in polling and then the margin of that um and I think there's a question about kind of a battle for
2:46
second place we think about other candidates like Governor Ronda santis and Ambassador Nikki Haley who have kind
2:52
of been jockeying amongst themselves to trying to position themselves as the Trump alternative the half candidate you
2:58
know I was mentioning IS F ramaswami who's still in this race but you know didn't have enough support to be able to
3:03
make the CNN debate that's on Wednesday and is really kind of uh on the tail end I think of a campaign that's had some
3:10
rhetorical flourishes but never was a serious effort to kind of like win the Republican nomination so I think that's
3:16
kind of the literal state of play of the field right now but I think the macro question in front of us is just like is
3:23
this primary even real you know is this a March to the coronation of Donald Trump or are Republican voters having
3:31
more of an open contest and an open decision making than we kind of have thought over the last year and so I
3:37
think Iowa will be the first step to providing Clarity on that but that's really it the only question is do the
3:42
voters themselves have any appetite into to making this a quote unquote real race
3:48
and like to that point can you describe the Iowa voter who are they what makes
3:54
them different from the rest of the country so I think when you when you ask the question of like how would you pick
4:00
and the Iowa voer I mean they have been kind of charactered in American politics
4:07
and so I don't want to just lean into the stereotypes but these are people who care more about farming are more people
4:13
who care more about candidates who may speak to kind of Rural Life speak to small town values speak to religious and
4:20
faith-driven things and that's been reflective in what we've talked
4:26
about well come on it's a good day to be in church amen
4:31
I think about when we went to Pastor Newman's church last year there are too many Christians that would rather see
4:38
politicians they don't like burn and be destroyed than repent and follow
4:45
Jesus someone who was supporting Governor Ronda santz and he was making a point of in the pull pit about kind of
4:53
protecting the family against the changing gender and sexuality education in the country someone's like here it is
4:59
look if you want a church that affirms you in your sin there's plenty they usually have rainbows in front of them
5:06
all right go to one of those churches that's something we hear a lot in Iowa I think about the woman who told me
5:12
outside of the Tim Scott event in Story County about how she wants to go back to the 50s those were the perfect years I
5:19
mean everybody dressed perfectly they acted perfectly didn't hear naughty words I'd like us to go back to that
5:25
when moms stayed in the home and raised their children that's part of our problem today if Trump's the nominee as
5:31
someone who is looking at the Alternatives if he's the nominee are you still voting for him oh yes oh yes I V
5:38
Republican sure want to get rid of the Democrats that we have and what they're doing and so what it translates to is a
5:44
pretty conservative state in general that's wary of Democrats and the idea that they are pushing a version of the
5:51
country that is misaligned with their conservative values we talked to some people at the State Fair who appreciated
5:57
what Trump did as president I would prefer that he didn't run because of all
6:02
of the baggage he's going to bring to the White House if he does win but at the same time they worried about how his
6:09
baggage and style would fit in this current moment I don't know he just kind of comes along to me as a bully trying
6:15
to bully his way through and yeah he has ideas that are beneficial probably you know to different people and different
6:21
groups and but yeah it just kind of seems like it's his way or the highway I
6:27
think that's a real Iowa voter also and so if we look at kind of the spectrum of those people I think that stretches the
6:33
gamut there is a more conservative State than say New Hampshire there's more religious State than say Nevada and I
6:40
think it's expressed a little differently than those kind of Southern States like South Carolina Mississippi
6:45
and the like those states are considered kind of trump country and so what I think is really important about Iowa is
6:53
if Trump is going to be overtaken it has to start with these kind of communities and they have to kind of settle on who
6:58
that alternate is going to be well tell me a little bit about like the relationship between Iowa voters and
7:04
Trump this time yeah it's important I think to remember where Donald Trump was in 2016 in Iowa this was a state that
7:10
preferred Ted Cruz over him and I think that continued their tradition of backing traditional Evangelical
7:16
candidates and you know I think a lot of people expected IA to do that again this time around the state's Governor Kim
7:23
Reynolds has endorsed Governor Anto Sanz I think that was the direction I think people assumed Iowa go but what we've
7:30
seen over the last year is a real split between the top levels of Iowa Republicans and that kind of Grassroots
7:36
bace poll after poll shows us and I think it's reflected in the anecdotal data and the crowd sizes and like that
7:44
Rank and foul evangelicals recile Iowa Republicans are still kind of backing
7:49
Donald Trump and in fact his share of voter has kind of increased from that 2016 and so whether it was his time in
7:56
office or people we've talked to who say that like him being indicted has actually made them like him more there
8:02
is certainly a type of Iowa Republican at least per polling that did not back
8:08
him in 2016 that has come back around to him right now so I think that's one point to know about the importance of
8:14
that relationship but I think it's also important to remember that there's a reason Donald Trump didn't win Iowa the
8:20
first time around and there's a reason those kind of top level Republicans have endorsed other candidates this is still
8:26
a state that's kind of uncomfortable with the match between you know someone who uh certainly is not like a
8:32
faith-based man and the kind of traditional quote unquote values that
8:37
Iowa says it represents and so I think we also really see a group of people who
8:44
didn't back him in 2016 here and have stayed away and I think that's around 40 50% of the electorate even when we see
8:50
him in polling now he has certainly outp passed other Rivals but there is a slice of the Republican base that has not come
8:55
around to him at least not now and so I think that is also really important is
9:01
while they have not coalesced around a single other individual they have not really embraced Donald Trump so there
9:07
are still questions about like the state's relationship to Donald Trump like what that looks like
9:13
now why don't you tell me where we are right now um we are in the parking lot outside Grace Family Church in Davenport
9:21
Iowa Davenport's like right across the border between Iowa and Illinois and we
9:28
are outside of faith for Trump event where Ben Carson former presidential
9:33
candidate really devout religious man is giving a speech on behalf of trump here
9:39
so it's a team Trump event featuring Ben Carson that's specifically about faith in the evangelicals so we're here
9:46
outside the church to kind of see uh this kind of awkward relationship in action between uh people who consider
9:53
themselves you know religious consider themselves deeply conservative and I imagine consider themselves really uh um
10:01
uncompromising on those values and the reality that they've compromised some of
10:06
those values to embrace Donald Trump and so this is where we are yeah I can like feel the cold creeping
10:16
in I mean just let it it's going to be in our bones for days weeks you know
10:23
just embrace it you know this is our future I reject it I fully reject it
10:28
it's not you know become one with the cult become one with the frigidness you know so like
10:34
your Midwest talking I know that's what I'm saying like what what like you know everyone needs Four Seasons right that's
10:41
me telling myself that okay you want to go in
10:49
[Music] yeah this looks like a converted
10:54
Sanctuary kind of that now has a backdrop that says team Trump and caucus
11:00
for Trump um and it's fairly full yeah about 100 people turned out for
11:07
this event sitting in plus chairs facing the front of the church and before Carson speech we started talking to
11:14
folks I my name is we're from The New York Times we've been talking to people here about what makes them come and what
11:21
uh what they're thinking about heading into the caucus wanted to know if y'all had 5 10 minutes to maybe chat with us before sure thank you so much I
11:27
appreciate it can I have your name joy and this is Patrick we're just
11:32
friends we just met here are y'all are y'all around Davenport are you from the are you in
11:38
Eastern Iowa like what part of the state are you from um I'm just down the road oh nice cool
11:45
he's in a little town called buffalo just down the street I'm in bondorf the next one over here yeah um do you all I
11:51
mean what made you want to come here I love Ben Carson I have followed Ben
11:57
Carson for a long time I love Trump trump is the first
12:02
president in my lifetime that never had a war and for the first time in my
12:10
lifetime cuz through throughout my whole life there was a war and this is a with
12:18
him being president it's the first time I was able to sleep
12:26
relax and be at peace did you consider any of the other Republican candidates
12:31
this time around or were you always thinking you're coming back to Trump no the others um never even considered once
12:40
I get their things in the mail all the time I don't know why it I just blow it
12:45
off Trump's your guy Trump's my guy are you someone who considered the other candidates or were you always with Trump
12:52
this time around not a chance Trump all the way he's not beholden to any of the garbage and kind of similar to what Joy
12:59
was saying he is the best president I've seen in my lifetime again no Wars peace
13:06
through strength United States was so strong when he was president and I loved how he had all of the world's evil
13:13
leaders in his pal he had them right here eating out of the palm of his hand
13:18
no president's ever done that because they're politicians Trump is not a politician and I love that I love that
13:26
what should we be looking for on Monday I mean is it just is Trump going to run away with this you think oh absolutely
13:33
absolutely if he doesn't I'd be shocked if he doesn't it'll be set up it'll but
13:40
I can't imagine a cockus being that way but there'll be something crooked
13:46
because I've never talked to anyone who doesn't support Trump here in Iowa I
13:51
haven't I've seen one place with Nikki Haley signs and that's it I haven't seen any other Nikki Haley signs the governor
13:58
Endor to santis some Evangelical leaders in the state endorse to santis it didn't really seem to move the needle she won't
14:04
be Governor again so as a trump supporter you held that against her oh yeah you know one thing that comes up
14:10
for us is you know the the amount of legal cases he's going to face this year right he's going to have to spend some time in federal court did the
14:17
indictments make your resolve for Trump stronger yeah they're screwing up our legal system they're taking advantage of
14:23
it and they are destroying it they're knocking it down it ain't right you ever
14:29
had a speeding ticket and you or uh or anything and it really you wasn't
14:35
speeding but you know and you you were treated you know unfairly you thought
14:42
and then if you got put in jail and indied and so on and so forth wouldn't
14:49
your family come to your Aid you're saying that's how you feel it's like you're coming to his Aid yeah we we
14:56
believe in him and he's kind of like the people 's president and the people want
15:02
to help him want to protect him and every time he gets hurt just makes us
15:09
matter thank you so much to I really appreciate it thank you help me in
15:15
welcoming famed doctor Dr Ben
15:25
Carson I am absolutely inv it to be back in cold Frozen
15:34
Iowa in his speech you know when you talk about courage I think about Donald Trump
15:42
because Carson had a clear message for the audience about Trump and Faith you know I've I had a number of
15:48
conversations with uh Donald Trump about religion and religious liberty and
15:54
things of that nature do you realize that he signed more more executive
16:00
orders for religious liberty than any other president probably all the others put
16:06
together and uh you know a lot of people don't like him they say the things that
16:12
he says and they so coarse and and mean and I just couldn't possibly ever vote
16:19
for someone like that well there's actually a reason that God gave us eyes and ears
16:28
and a brain because would you rather have somebody whose tongue is maybe a little
16:35
wild but has incredibly good policies that make your life better or somebody
16:42
who has a silver tongue and says all the right things and has terrible policies
16:48
which ruin your life and those of your children and grandchildren you know that's for the voters here who might
16:54
still have their reservations about Trump Carson was giving them permission to see this as a choice that was not
17:01
against their belief thank you and God
17:15
bless after the speech ended we started talking to one voter Jim vas how are you
17:20
great you good my name is AEP this is Anna we're reporters with the New York Times and then we're actually talking to people about why they came today why
17:26
they're um and what they're thinking about the caucus on Monday do you have maybe 5 minutes to chat yeah that'd be
17:32
fine um well I guess I would ask who your caucusing for but I imagine I know
17:38
yeah Donald Trump yeah can you describe to me just what you're wearing explain to me your shirt just for the audio um
17:43
the shirt uh uh needless to say is what we believe in in reference to Donald Trump so it's Donald Trump's mug shot it
17:50
says wanted at the top and then it says under for a second term what's the reaction when you wear that shirt like
17:57
out it's surprising that um shoot any place we we travel quite a bit we're both retired and uh we have a lot of
18:04
trump uh um gear I'll call it and uh we get a lot of high fives a lot of support
18:10
and out of all the traveling that we've done I've only had one person that was actually against what I was wearing okay
18:16
did you poet for him in 2016 yes okay we sure did what is the biggest reason why Trump has your vote again he's a
18:23
non-politician um he's uh he puts America first he's against uh all the
18:29
things that are happening right now open borders the the debacle in Afghanistan um shoot uh the homelessness
18:37
he forgot about the uh President Biden forgot about the uh veterans but there's just so many things going on that um
18:45
with Donald Trump he's outside that political box and I think he's here for the people M are you uh consider
18:51
yourself a faith-based filder your religious person yes yes I am you know Ben Carson here was talking about kind
18:56
of trump and faith and and why why kind of evangelicals and Christians here are like deciding to back him that's one of
19:01
the things we're specifically interested in and you know Donald Trump is not someone you know as Dr Carson says who
19:07
who might who might come off as kind of personally religious certainly says things that seem kind of out of left
19:12
field for people who might not understand how someone who considers themselves maybe a Christian or
19:17
Evangelical is voting for Donald Trump can you help explain that for me well I think that uh um down inside Donald
19:24
Trump is a religious person um believes in God and I think when he was in office
19:30
before he helped a majority of the people can't help all people but he helped a majority of the people and being a Christian you try to help all
19:36
people and and so I think his actions in reference to um all the things that he
19:42
accomplished back in office um I think shows that he is a true
19:47
Christian as the event ended we spoke with two other Iowa Republicans Linda
19:52
shith and Nicole Hopkins hi Hi how are you Hi how are y'all my name isad this is Anna we're
19:58
from The New York Times we're with our politics podcast the runup um and we've been here in Iowa talking to people
20:04
obviously about the caucuses are you someone who is planning the caucus for Trump on Monday absolutely did you think
20:10
about any of the other candidates in the in the primary or were you all someone who was always with Trump from the start
20:15
well we've been pretty much always with Trump but we absolutely listened to what they all had to say yeah and I followed
20:23
it very very closely and really follow Trump for precisely what Dr Carson said
20:30
he's if you could describe what you think is the biggest reason why you prefer Trump again rather than the other candidates what would what would what
20:37
would that be he is proven we can look at what he did you
20:43
know when he was president four years ago and how he straightened out the country and how it's Fallen apart in the
20:49
past three years and I think he'll bring it right back again and if he doesn't get in I think our country is
20:56
over do you feel that same kind of sense of urgency did you think about any of the other candidates um I'm still
21:02
thinking I'm still thinking um there's a lot of things I like about Trump and there's a lot of things I like about the
21:08
other two candidates as well so you really feel yourself open between all three of them I guess I'm curious
21:14
because you know I think for a lot of people they would assume that you already know at this point Trump has been president you know you've seen I'm
21:20
sure the ads have been flooding your TV for a year uh and so the I'm really curious and people who are undecided
21:26
still right now is things I mean he can be he can talk a little too much
21:33
or his wording isn't always great his policies are effective um but also age
21:41
you know so that's a concern I'm curious you know specific to the the argument that Dr Carson was
21:46
making about faith in Trump and saying that he's the person who will protect religious liberty he's the person who's
21:52
kind of a champion for kind of like Evangelical voters what do you all think about that I think I'm curious to hear
21:58
people respond to that considering Trump is not someone you would necessarily associate with religion I think at the
22:05
top of your head but is that an argument that you all find convincing I don't think he's just for
22:11
evangelicals I think he is doing the thing doing what he's doing for our
22:16
country rather than evangelicals I get so upset with people that say that
22:23
evangelicals are a one isue voter and that's abs about abortion yeah that's
22:30
absolutely not true we're thinking about the country we're thinking about the Constitution we're thinking about our
22:37
grandchildren that's the only reason I've been I've been really outspoken and I've never been outspoken in politics to
22:43
go kind of back to what you were saying about how like evangelicals aren't just like one issue voters and you you you
22:49
resent that sort of narrative that they are can you help me connect the dots between that feeling and Donald
22:56
Trump well Donald Trump had four years where he really showed that he was he could
23:04
take care of all kinds of things not just the abortion issue I mean he took care of the Border he took care of
23:10
friendliness with other countries they respected him and people that say Donald Trump's going to get in and start a war
23:16
that's ridiculous he was the one president that kept us out of War so
23:22
thank you thank you all so much we really appreciate it it was so great talking to you thank you thank you
23:28
[Music]
23:35
more after the [Music]
23:56
break [Music]
24:06
so I said it is Sunday it's cockus eve
24:11
true can you pull out your phone and tell me what the forecast
24:17
is um yeah well right now it says it's
24:22
-6 with the high of -5 and the low of -17 tomorrow
24:29
it is a high of -1 and a low of -19 and if you factor in the
24:38
windchill it it feels like -37 that's just like an offensive
24:44
sentence it feels like 37 you know a thing I learned this week unfortunately
24:51
is that ne40 is where Fahrenheit and Celsius meet wow that's the thing I learned right now like you would see
24:57
that on paper and You' be like I'm never going to experience that and yet here we are we're experiencing it yeah I was in
25:03
college during the polar vortex in the midwest in Wisconsin where it hit -40 and I remember we had classes cancelled
25:10
and all of that and then we all bundled up just to like go to some bad dive bar
25:15
and I feel like it's you know it's kind of a similary thing here where like the conditions are saying stay inside the
25:22
health warnings are saying stay inside but you also have the like political incentive in these candidates and
25:28
campaign saying Hey what if you didn't yeah so just to that point what
25:33
has the weather done to campaigning this weekend well it's become the biggest storyline I mean when we left the Carson
25:40
event we knew that this storm was coming on but not necessarily how it would upend the whole weekend that morning we
25:47
drove from Davenport to De Mo it's about a three-hour drive already you were
25:52
seeing kind of cars abandoned on side of highway you were seeing trucks that had spun out uh on the side of the highway
25:59
and it was a real kind of reminder of like how dangerous this can be the traditional final Sprint into the caucus
26:06
that you see with candidates holding tons of events and trying to flood the Zone with volunteers and and make sure
26:13
they uh rally out voters all of that has been upended the last two days most of the events were canceled as the snow was
26:19
coming down so Donald Trump Nikki Haley Ronda santis were also forced to change
26:24
up some of their schedule there's a poll that the mo register or leases over the final weekend that usually drives a lot
26:30
of conversation and drives a lot of kind of late game jockeying between the candidates uh but the results were I
26:36
think matched up with a lot of things we've seen over the year it show Donald Trump at 48% uh Nikki Haley at 20% and
26:43
that to santis had fallen three percentage points back from their last one down to third place in 16% that PK
26:49
came and went yesterday because the main storyline is the weather I think it's like weirdly reflective of what's been a
26:56
weird primary itself um this has already for a year been a campaign where the front runner was
27:02
skipping traditional events was not kind of doing Iowa typically and we haven't seen really voters punish him for that I
27:09
think like even more so now considering the weather and the impacts it's hard to really take the kind of caucuses as
27:16
something to extrapolate to the rest of the Republican electorate not only because of what's been weird here for a
27:21
year or so but because the actual result will be so infused by this historically brutal weather if this were not
27:27
historically dramatic weather what would the final weekend leading up to cockus
27:33
night look like in a more traditional more like seasonally appropriate year at this point of a campaign you're not
27:39
really looking for persuading people with kind of new arguments you're looking to mobilize the people who like
27:46
you and to be visible a a and to make sure you're keeping your name and brand
27:52
out in front of people so a lot of these events are kind of like turnout rallies are energy machines and a lot of
27:58
campaigns try to spread them out through the state so make sure they're hitting people in De Mo but also in more rural
28:04
outside communities know Donald Trump's a good example because you know Not only was he supposed to have a commit to
28:09
caucus event that got cancelled but he also has kind of surrogate spread out through the state to make sure he uh
28:15
reaches people in all all corners of Iowa I saw that Donald Trump Jr uh is
28:21
doing an event in anen uh these are the kind of people that he uses to make sure
28:26
that the Trump campaign is uh remaining visible even if he's not physically there and that's something that
28:32
obviously his star power kind of lends itself to but at this point it's not as if you're saying oh I'm going to sharpen
28:38
you know I'm G to drop a new policy plan you know like this is all about energy
28:43
and turnout and organization uh and I think the Cole complicates that okay so
28:49
on actual caucus day what are the sort of things that you're going to be looking for I think there's three things
28:55
I'm looking for on caucus day itself one question is do people come out to
29:00
obviously participate another question is how it affects the campaign's organization are they able to you know
29:06
fan out volunteers and do those kind of last minute kind of touchstones that a lot of campaigns like to do but I think
29:12
the third question is like do candidates now have a built-in excuse to kind of wish away the Iowa results let's say
29:19
today's Closer Than People expect or let's say Donald Trump wins by more than people expect I can already see how
29:25
candidates are going to say well my people couldn't come out or well the historic cold front changed the scope of
29:32
the race it provides a kind of get out of jail free card for campaigns because they're not kind of working at an equal
29:38
playing field and it is historic it is a uniquely difficult weather weekend and so that's also going to be something I
29:44
look for let's say Dan santis doesn't do that well here in Iowa a place where he's invested a lot in terms of money
29:50
and volunteers and television ads I can easily see that campaign saying well that's because of the cold um or you
29:57
know or certainly Donald Trump if they that result is closer than expected we were talking to voters in Davenport who
30:03
were saying you know well maybe it's crooked or maybe it's something up else that's fishy so like you know once again
30:10
Iowa's uh outlierness might end up being more important than any Iowa predictiveness
30:18
about who's going to be com the nominee okay you you said all the things you're looking
30:23
for the thing I'm looking for is just to stay alive yeah I mean we that's the thing about
30:30
making these things like the weather's going to complicate whether people can come out like we're trying to get to a cockus so like one key an hour away yeah
30:37
yeah one key survival PC here will be our own Survival so like you know that's
30:44
partly what I'm going to judge this on is like are we able to get there itself which will be part of the you know it's
30:51
like a really oppressive version of Amazing Race you know like and so that's
30:57
you know that's what's that's what Monday's going to [Music] be we'll be back later this week with
