The Comedian Roy Wood Jr. on Biden, Trump and Whatâ€™s Funny About 2024


0:03
the stakes of this election could not be more serious but at the same time in this matchup of two very old largely
0:10
unpopular candidates there is no shortage of material for comedians this may be bad news for the
0:18
country however it's good news for the White House Correspondents Dinner the
0:23
Super Bowl of political comedy held this Saturday in Washington DC typically the president attends the
0:31
dinner and delivers a speech underscoring the values of the First Amendment while also trying his hand at
0:37
some jokes but the headline Act is a set from a famous comedian like John Stewart in
0:44
1997 Randa Sykes in 2009 y give it up for dark
0:50
[Music] Brandon last year the comedian was Roy
0:56
Wood Jr a veteran of The Daily Show on Comedy Cent happy to be here oh real quick Mr
1:02
President I think you left some of your classified documents up here you get who killed it yeah no don't give him
1:09
to him I'll put him in a safe place he don't know where to keep him I'm and pull no punches in the process
1:15
anti-t policies are an attack on black history and an attempt to erase the
1:21
contributions of black people from the history books that's what it
1:26
is you are trying to erase black people people and a lot of black people wouldn't mind some of that eraser as
1:33
long as that black person is Clarence Thomas taking go on Supreme Court Justices there's too many Trump scandals
1:40
to keep up with keeping up with Trump scandals is like watching Star Wars movies you got to watch the third one to
1:46
understand the first one then you got you can't miss the second one cuz it's got Easter eggs for the fifth one Donald
1:52
Trump is the only politician who scandals got spin-offs on Disney plus the former president we should be
1:58
inspired by the events in frame they rioted when the retirement age went
2:03
up 2 years to 64 they rioted cuz they didn't want to
2:09
work till 64 meanwhile in America we have an 80-year-old man begging us for
2:15
four more years of work
2:20
begging begging and even President Biden while
2:27
he was sitting right there so as another Correspondence Dinner approaches I
2:33
wanted to talk with Roy Wood Jr about the gig how political comedy has changed
2:39
and this election in general what's it like roasting the president to his face and what is there
2:45
to laugh about in an election that doesn't seem funny at
2:50
all from the New York Times I'm aead Hearn this is the runup
2:56
[Music] can you first just introduce yourself
3:01
and tell me what you do my name is roywood JR um I'm an Emy nominated
3:08
documentary producer and comedian and I guess now an author once this book
3:15
comes out which one of those titles is your favorite comedian because that's the one nobody can take from me I guess
3:22
I wanted to start with the correspondence dinner can you tell me about what that was like to host and
3:27
what your process was to do something that I think is so unique not only to
3:32
tell jokes in that space but with the president sitting right next to you it was fun after the fact was it just
3:40
nerve-wracking going into it yeah okay yeah it's it's probably I mean second
3:46
only to Showtime at the Apollo probably the most stressed I've been leading up
3:51
to a g I like that Showtime comes before the Press absolutely cuz show time with the Apollo's black people yeah like that
3:57
and that's far worse like actually hurt my feelings yeah a journalist will just
4:03
stare black people will actively Boo and attack your soul really it'll make you
4:08
better in the long run but but that 100% 100% I feel that even about stories
4:15
about black folks of like the stress level like a little but when I when I did Showtime with Apollo that was
4:21
nerve-wracking but I think that was like 02 so then it's like Fast Forward 20
4:26
years later yeah it's like oh I still don't know how to do this job the most
4:33
difficult thing that I think comedians deal with now with the correspondence dinner the news changes so frequently
4:41
now and what people care to talk about changes so fast it is probably to me the
4:48
correspondence dinner is easily one of the singular events and
4:54
standup comedy that is truly reflective of where we are as a country at that
5:00
exact moment and it is probably the most curated comedic meal that can be
5:07
presented next to a comedian performing live live on television interesting you
5:13
know I remember some of the jokes you made and you know we actually talked to democratic strategist Jim missina and he
5:18
was telling us that he actually thinks it's core to the election that Joe Biden helps diffuse his age issue with jokes
5:24
and I was wondering like from your perspective how did you think about Biden and age going into that speech and
5:30
also like if you have any take on that opinion that The Angst of a 82y old
5:36
president 81 right now can be lessened if he's joking about it yeah I think anything can be lessened
5:44
with a joke that's what Trump has done Trump blows it off or tells you why it's
5:50
not important but he doesn't ignore it I don't think you can ignore anything that the American people are bringing to you
5:55
we chose not to really lean in on Biden's age I think we had one or two age jokes but
6:03
we ended up dropping them because Biden went up before
6:08
me and he had he had like I can't even remember man but he had he had a heater
6:15
about him and rert Murdoch you might think I don't like rert Murdoch that's
6:20
simply not true how could I just like a guy who makes me look like Harry
6:27
Styles call me
6:33
I call it being seasoned you say I'm ancient I say I'm
6:40
wise they say I'm over the hill Don Lemon would say that's a man of
6:46
his Prime and so Biden in a way kind of
6:52
eight mileed me and like took what I was G to say about him and used it against
6:57
himself all so I couldn't even you so I'm that's the other thing about the correspondence Diner while Biden is
7:03
talking I'm texting with the writers in the room you're editing oh we're changing jokes in the moment when he did
7:10
that joke I was like okay the Biden old joke I have I don't even remember what it was but I was like no uhhuh cuz it's
7:17
not as good and he's already called himself old so you know fine but I think
7:23
this idea of trying to hide from the thing that people are showing concern
7:29
about it only makes people more concerned so you just have to attack it head on you
7:34
know I think that's why like even with his State of the Union Address yeah most people just watching to see if he was
7:40
going to stutter or slur absolutely it was it was such a funny energy because people's expectations
7:46
going again I was like everyone's just here to see if they if he's going to like collapse on stage or not like no
7:51
one like all the reports the next day was just like man he he made it what did he say what was the policy
7:58
oh I don't know and everyone oh he had so much Vigor and and like you know I do my cable news stuff and it was so
8:04
interesting so I'm like we are not even talking about what the man said you know
8:10
this was all about all about all you know it does raise a couple interesting
8:16
questions for us I had heard that you had a Biden joke that you didn't tell at the correspondence Center I wondered if you could tell us jokes that you think
8:22
like were good that you didn't get the chance to say that was I do remember having a couple jokes
8:30
about the fact that Joe Biden got the black vote in spite of owning a German
8:37
Shepherd the cop is dog yeah as as much as we know
8:43
about as much as we know about the German Shepherd and what the German Shepherd has done to the black
8:50
race and also the aggressive German Shepherd his German Cher is busy biting people left or right that dog bite
8:57
everybody um
9:02
standby I know times are changing Paramount is selling bet and no
9:08
white people bid on it that's how you know media is in a bad place white people don't want to own black people
9:15
anymore was that when you said or was that you yeah I did a version of it but but that's what I mean it's like certain
9:21
things you just go back and look at them and you just go ah it's
9:27
too the Harris Biden 20 4 slogan was still the least racist
9:32
option um you know we actually talked to Ron Clan Biden's former Chief of Staff
9:38
who said that one of his strengths against Donald Trump is that Donald Trump cannot exoticize Joe Biden that
9:44
Joe Biden because he has this kind of Scranton Joe frame that it's hard for
9:49
people to think of him as kind of a character do you think that's true like one question I had is is that still true
9:56
or is Joe Biden currently a character of kind of an old man man like I don't I don't used to be Scranton Joe it kind of
10:03
feels a little different now I think the issue in the conversation with age and trying to avoid that is that the
10:08
conversation was lost on some policy and stuff that they may have actually gotten accomplished you
10:16
know and I think ultimately that's the thing but you know
10:22
in America if we're talking politics all you're voting for is something that looks familiar to you mhm you know does
10:30
this thing does this thing look like something I already recognize because
10:35
we're not taking chances on anything new you know we're not at at at any given
10:40
time now that we're in the spring of 2024 just seven months out from a trump Biden general election rematch let ask
10:47
more broadly like how does political comedy feel right now it feels fine to me I think it's
10:56
more it doesn't feel as broad as it used to be I think audiences
11:03
are more entrenched in their own beliefs and I think that they're looking for what I like to call confirmation humor
11:10
you know we talk about confirmation bias or whatever but the idea that I want to laugh at things that are rooted in
11:15
premises that I already agree with and that's more fun and entertaining being
11:21
challenged that's happening more now yeah I feel like if comedy is rooted in
11:26
something you don't believe then you're going to reject everything if you don't agree
11:32
with the premise you're not going to agree with the punchline you're not going to laugh at the punch line yeah it ain't funny when did you feel that shift
11:38
most tangibly when did it become clear that audiences were expecting different things from comedians Trump somewhere
11:44
around that women's March is where I think there was a lot of entrenching women's March Muslim band kids and cages
11:52
yeah yeah that was a nice Trifecta of Who You wi you know what I mean like
11:58
really what are you aligning yourself with and the idea that there can't
12:05
be this criticism of like if you did a joke and you
12:13
said Obama expelled or expelled we were in
12:18
school if you did a joke as a liberal committee and you said Obama deported as many immigrants as many
12:26
illegals As Trump did then that joke that premise right there
12:34
it feels anti-obama so you're going to you're going to draw so this idea of the times and the
12:43
stakes are too critical politically to be splitting hairs and going well they're doing that and they're doing
12:48
this and I think that when the stakes in the country really started getting more serious politically speaking I think
12:55
that one side's ability to laugh at something that they may not agree with started to dissipate I can see that y
13:02
because that joke even if it's true in the greater scheme of what you
13:08
may believe politically I deem it problematic yeah yeah now is not the time for that it's and and this is say
13:15
that like if you look back when John Stewart premiered I see what it was the
13:20
Trump's old Biden's old and everybody was like now is not the time to bring up H yeah yeah and that's rooted in the
13:27
stakes that's the only reason because we've called presidents old before yeah and Biden's objectively old they're both
13:34
objectively old we called Bob Dole old yeah and granted he was running
13:40
against like differing you know younger more youthful Republicans and Democrats
13:46
but the idea of a president being called too old is not new but at this current
13:51
state of society that we're in I think that as the plausible became
13:57
policy that's when really I think that's when I think the way people receive humor political humor I think it changed
14:05
I I you know and and to me once you get kids in cages once you get you know and
14:10
when you look at the women's Marg you look at where we are now with laws and you got to say the women were kind of right to be
14:16
marching the plausible became policy it is still so you know and that's not even
14:22
bringing up police reform and George Floyd like and Military so I think
14:28
that's where it ain't funny to a lot of people you
14:34
know you're identifying one change that has taken place kind of from 2018 kind of the Trump era has changed political comedy one thing that we come up against
14:40
now is how in this election specifically people want to tune a lot of stuff out they're not really kind of in that same
14:47
level of Engagement as I think folks were in the 2017 in the 2018 time that you're talking about how do you find
14:54
comedy for this moment when it does feel like people's willingness to engage AG
14:59
or or even think about candidates who they find really familiar frankly one of
15:06
other options for like we keep running into people who want to block it all out how do you make jokes for that moment I
15:12
think you just have to acknowledge truth I think the best comedians are just acknowledging what's already happening what's already going on in the room and
15:19
just speaking the unspoken or just speaking what is already universally known I think we also have to stop
15:26
looking at comedy as some sort of catalyst for Change and activism and
15:33
Awakening people interesting because I sometimes hear people describe the you know they okay it might be for certain
15:38
people who receive it but you have to respect that most comedians that's not their goal that's the goal of an
15:44
activist activist activate comedian do comedy you know so I think that within
15:52
the comedy there can be things that help to get people to give a damn about
15:57
voting or give a dam damn about this election is the one so you know when you
16:03
looking at trying to do jokes about something that people aren't really excited about to me the jokes would be
16:09
rooted in the fact that nobody's excited right you just say what it is and like that's and then you have to figure out
16:16
what the jokes are about that and so maybe through that if someone goes oh wow you see me and I understand you
16:24
understand what I'm thinking right now and then on the back side of that if I want to go but here's why you still go
16:29
and vote like to me it's state and local you know we use all of
16:36
these Federal and national elections and it's just I'm not going to the polls at
16:41
all why because you're not excited about two old dudes okay fine but also on that ballot dummy was 40 other things that
16:49
actually affect where you live that's why you should be showing up that's what you should give a damn
16:56
about but you know State and local isn't covered as wide it isn't given as much
17:03
attention and you know unfortunately in a lot of instances those are the cases
17:10
that really do change you know yeah change of
17:17
[Music] place after the break more about Roy's
17:23
life and career and how he thinks about one of the central characters of this year's political comedy Donald
17:31
[Music]
17:53
Trump besides his history and comedy there's another reason I wanted to talk with roywood Jr Roy comes from a
18:01
journalism family I did my degree is in broadcast and so you know and I come from a family of journalists you know my
18:07
father was a radio news journalist for many many decades covering innumerable
18:13
conflicts I have two brothers who you know anchor report news desk EP like
18:19
every form every every job with in a TV station and he got a start at a local
18:25
radio station while attending Florida A&M University the historically black
18:30
college in Tallahassee so I ride my bike up to the station I asked buddy I just straight up ask him hey man look y'all
18:37
don't have no news can I come in here and do news twice an hour I'll do three local stories I'll do you know three
18:42
National two local and a kicker the brother hires me to do that they have a co-host who is a comedian who's also a
18:49
school teacher who has to leave every day at 8:00 a.m. some days I didn't have class till 11: so I would just stay at
18:57
the radio station until 10 and over the course of a couple of months they started letting me co-host this
19:04
eventually led to on air gigs back in his hometown of Birmingham Alabama work that was deeply rooted in the black
19:10
community as the local station you're in the community you know we we had there was an incident in Birmingham one time
19:17
where and this is pre-t traymon Martin there was an incident in Birmingham one
19:23
time where a number of police officers there we had a bunch
19:29
of police officers shot in one day I think it was four was shot three died and so we
19:37
have the mayor on we have the community on this idea of understanding pain as a
19:42
community but then also understanding the broken relationship between the black community and the police
19:48
department and some of the calls that we took didn't go the way you thought they would go after a bunch of police
19:54
officers been killed and it's people trying to have the conversation about
20:00
police corruption and let's while we're talking about the police and what they do let's also talk about ways to improve so then it's it ain't time for that
20:06
conversation well when is the time so and it's Roy's time in radio spent understanding local issues that he
20:13
credits with shaping his unique approach to Comedy today these nuanced discussions within
20:19
the black community were my regular everyday occurrence and that was the things that I had to prep for every day
20:25
on air so you know in between ludicrous songs and arguing whether or not Kim
20:33
Kardashian should stay with Ray J early the rise of Kardashian you have
20:40
all of these other topics and that's comedically you write what you know you joke what you care about and those are the things I cared about and so that's
20:46
when my comedy really started shifting from just being silly college kid got it that's 19 to actually oh well let's talk
20:55
a little bit about this particular issue or let's talk about standing for the anthem or not you know and so that's
21:02
really where how radio local radio really changed the things that I cared about
21:09
because I saw the people who were being affected by things that aren't changing R would eventually leave radio to become
21:16
a full-time comic and after nearly a decade as a correspondent on The Daily Show he left in Fall of
21:23
2023 but he's still performing standup regularly which of course means closely
21:29
following how the 2024 election is playing out the last thing I wanted to talk about is Donald Trump like we I was
21:36
I remember being in DC once and Donald Trump was giving a speech to the Republican ccress this while he was
21:43
President he walks into the capito hill and the first thing he said was um you know to be honest with y'all I I like
21:49
only 30% of you and I started cracking up and it made me in one of those moments I realized like he is funny like
21:56
and he says these things that are not it's like very unintentionally funny I think Joe Biden's funny in a different
22:02
way but Trump has this like unique brand of humor I guess what is it
22:07
uncomfortable to say that like what's unique about it though he's what you know all the time it's relatable yeah
22:15
ain't nothing unique about Donald Trump we all know a guy like Trump talk crazy say whatever you know
22:23
he full of it but man he's fun to be around he's the if Trump was black he would be the guy in the barber shop in
22:29
the black barber shop who just never got never stop just talking the whole time what do you do for a living I don't know
22:35
where do you get your money I don't know the way I was in the barber shop two weeks ago and I was like does this man have a job like I have been here for
22:41
three I've been waiting for three cuts and he's still here talking and then you ask man whatever happened with that court case ah don't worry about that
22:49
it's a it's a Witch Hunt I mean I do think saying Donald Trump is funny for a lot of people does
22:54
minimize said seriousness he's also the most joked about person how do you tell jokes about Donald Trump without it
23:01
feeling so familiar because jokes used to be a form of throwing a rock at The Establishment but now Trump catches your
23:06
rock and goes thank you and then adds it to his bag of rocks that's a good way to put it and
23:11
then shows it to all of his followers and go look at all these rocks they threw at me these people they don't want
23:17
me and I'm here for you and I'm taking these rocks for you so vote for me I
23:22
think the when we does that make you want to avoid talking about him me no
23:27
but I try to keep my conversations on policy instead of the person people change but the same injustices are
23:34
always there no matter it's a rotating chair of who to throw the rocket but I
23:40
think one of the issues is that what Trump figured out is
23:45
that people care more about being entertained than governed so if you can entertain people
23:53
then they won't be paying as much attention when you're passing policies that aren't in their best
23:59
interests and so you know Trump out entertains most people you know almost
24:05
out entertained Biden in 2020 you know he did out Entertain You Know policy one
24:12
you had enough cous Republicans who were like H I'll vote for Biden this time
24:17
this guy scares me like Trump entertains regular people but probably
24:23
scares the hell out of really rich and powerful people because he's a Loose Cannon and he and they can't fully tell
24:28
whether or not he's one of them in terms of sanity and actual money
24:34
you know how do you then communicate the stakes of a serious thing right because
24:42
he's leaning so much into entertainment but at the same time Donald Trump is
24:47
promising the mass deportation effort you know install judges that vote in his favor all of those things is very explicitly promising this time he did
24:54
some of it he already he did some of it before but I'm saying this time it's he feels even more clear the promise to
24:59
upend is that something that I know I sound kind of like those people in the crowd now but is that something to joke
25:08
about how else can I get people to listen though
25:15
and I think that's what we're those are the only two things we're armed with is either laughs or yelling hey you got to
25:22
pay attention to this versus Man y'all hear this man said that he going to
25:27
deport every everybody all right well then it's like the old George Lopez joke you're going to deport everybody okay
25:33
well then who's going to build your wall mhm all right well that's a joke but rooted in that is actual no we need
25:41
immigrants because immigrants come over and they do a bunch of work that Americans don't want to do like that's a deeper Point George Lopez is making more
25:47
concisely and quickly so like you take something like that that's an easier way
25:54
to get people to understand because most people I just think Americans they're
25:59
tired of getting yelled at so much yelling I mean do you think Democrats or
26:05
folks running against Trump have understood his power as a comic or they
26:11
understand it but they can't mimic it if they could they would have who in the Democratic party is as
26:17
Reckless and entertaining to Democrats in any type of way also because the Democratic party is
26:23
also seen as the party that's more Regal and put together and button down and this is the right way that you do politician I'm trying to think of like
26:29
who's the funniest Democrat like if you just booked a comedy show I don't know if any Democrat joke
26:37
for joke I don't know I don't I don't even know on an undercard if there's a Democrat that I could even put up
26:43
against RFK have you looked at any of the conservative Community I remember like like gutfield or whatever who is
26:49
like has a huge program now I have tried to watch that show just in my like understanding of conservatives and like
26:56
I it feels confirmation humor it's it's mostly it is confirmation it's we're
27:01
already existing and this is the truth this is our truth let's joke from these truths yeah so if you already believe
27:07
these truths gut feels hilarious and there's a lot of people who believe those truths so I don't why would I and
27:15
then this goes back to the liberal side why would I propose that maybe Democrats
27:20
do have a fair point here and then do a joke about that if that's just going to piss people off and the ratings are
27:26
going to dip but then they make the same argument about John Oliver will or Daily Show in the sense that oh it's preaching
27:34
to your own choir it's all home team humor and that's fine I don't necessarily agree with that on either of
27:41
those programs but that's the accusation yeah that can be made because most people that watch Gutfeld I guarantee
27:46
you they're not they're not watching any of the other liberal comedy shows yeah
27:52
yeah I would imagine that they the the overlap of who watches Daily Show and gutfield I would love
27:58
I'm actually fun to meet that person for sure you know I watched The Daily Show I like coar but one thing I remember and I
28:04
think it informs some of the journalism work we did is I do think that that kind of Obama era time spent a lot of time
28:10
making fun of people who were gaining power at that same time the jokes about te party as they were winning the kind
28:16
of dismissal of trump as he was ascending do you look back and you think that like any of that political humor
28:26
minimized a growth that that was happening politically I think that
28:31
people who were joked about on the right were able to weaponize those attacks into campaign support I don't think you
28:39
have Trump without the tea party I don't think you have any of that without Sarah
28:45
Palin but then I'm not going to turn around and say it's Tina F's fault sure sure that we have Donald Trump it's like
28:53
the job of Comedy is to comment on what is happening so be it as it may to go
29:01
well maybe we shouldn't joke about this because it will be weaponized
29:06
somehow I don't know if any comedy show has ever thought about that or will ever
29:13
take that into consideration before booking
29:18
somebody are the people that joked about able to still take those jokes and use them to influence a voter base
29:25
absolutely absolutely you know there's a reason that Nikki
29:32
Haley will go on Saturday Night Live you know and there's a reason
29:38
Saturday Night Live will have Nikki Haley and that's oh that's a great
29:45
example of what I'm talking about of where people who you watchet yeah but
29:50
you you upset Saturday Night Live ain't never done but what they always do yeah
29:56
that's all they've ever done so they had Trump on so you think they w't
30:01
going to have Haley on this is the show who's making the news you come be
30:06
on our show because we joke about what's happening right now well don't you know Nicki Haley you're normalizing her
30:13
because now she's grinning on TV yeah but that our show is to just entertain people I I totally get that because I
30:20
remember in that moment I'm like well if if Nikki Haley can't be on SNL like it's hard for me to imagine a
30:27
conservative that could if that's the line that folks want to draw it is hard to imagine a person who can and maybe
30:34
that's what all these people want is for those to be only spaces of people who they think agree with them because you want SNL to be more than what it is and
30:41
it's not yeah and it's never going to be so stop putting that at the feet of the show you know you mentioned kind of
30:46
Trump's political power as a comedian I'm also thinking about the kind of objective numbers that tell us he's
30:52
still massively unpopular you know or or that people still for as much as they might be laughing hasn't it hasn't
30:58
necessarily translated to Mass Appeal particularly outside of the Republican base what can his comedic power you
31:06
going ahead I mean I guess I want to just be more specific on like when you say Trump is funny what do you think that
31:11
means I think he's entertaining like a old racist grandpa but you wouldn't let
31:17
him drive you on the freeway and
31:23
ultimately the job of President is to drive the country and we are in the car with this person
31:31
and you know he can be entertaining and he's
31:36
figured out a way to create the illusion that he knows what he's doing and
31:41
there's enough people that are angry enough that just to be Petty and contrarian they will vote for him yeah
31:49
it's not so much I love Trump as much as I just hate Biden I don't like the Democrats Democrats too buttoned up something you know when I was in South
31:55
Carolina I saw Trump kind of specifically make jokes about the santis was part of his strategy in terms of minimizing him and unlike a guy named
32:02
Ronda sanctimonious has anyone ever heard of him very disloyal guy I got him into office and then he said yeah I
32:08
guess I'd run against him why not who voted to gut Medicare do you know that desanctis that's the abbreviated name
32:15
the sanct is it's been part of that type of call-in car you know at CPAC we were talking to people have been to 50 Trump
32:21
rallies they like they like the kind of comedic standup routine that he goes through up there it does feel
32:28
that has been such a part of his core connection with his own base if I was
32:33
Joe Biden I would hire standup comedians to punch up every speech and anything
32:39
that I'm doing between now and November just to to match just to just a little
32:45
bit Jabs here and there but you know it's the debate that every Democrat is even at the state and
32:53
local level to gain Republican voters to to gain the Republican Centrist voter
32:59
you have to consider losing some of the more extreme liberals who may not
33:05
agree with your approach and so you have to be very careful about that and I think humor is a more effective way but
33:12
you just have to hope that all of these elections come down to policy and that's
33:18
what it seems like right now because it's just rooted in who has the policies
33:24
that are going to change the things that I don't like and because the stakes are
33:30
greater and because certain things have been put in Motion in the last8 years I still hope that policy is the deciding
33:37
factor and not who's the more entertaining women are not messing around cuz if it's a battle of
33:44
entertaining Biden probably loses he for sure loses but now do you want the funny guy
33:50
that's going to be in control of your uterus m is that who you want yeah or do
33:55
you want the boring guy who's going to let you do you want to do with your body same same game with you know with
34:03
everything that's happening in Palestine in Israel like for a lot of people this
34:08
ain't no joke I need to know what your policies are yeah that was a cute little joke there president but where do you
34:14
stand on this thing yeah so you're saying punch up the jokes at the same time of refocusing an arm policy yeah
34:20
and I think if you're able to do that then you're in a place where you're able to have some like part of what made
34:26
Obama Obama was his ability to make complicated things plain I said other thing is that
34:32
politics is way too complicated so whoever talks the dumbest yeah probably is going to get a
34:40
lot of the votes because well I got time for all these extra words and syllables
34:46
man just tell me what it is lock her up all right cool like thanks yeah meanwhile
34:53
Hillary's going you must understand the policy and the complicated measure and the
34:58
no too many words you know there's a funny moment in Trump ry's where he clearly just like lists off like five
35:04
policies but it's in like 10 seconds cuz he's not here to talk about the policies he's only here to R up the crowd that
35:09
type of way we still think that we live Democrats still live in a world where they believe that being educated and
35:16
well read is something to be revered and celebrated and appreciated for and there
35:21
is a faction in this country that rebel against that and almost take it as an insult and they feel talk down to yeah I
35:28
tell this to people all the time but like there is a section of I think uh I would put like Centrist liberals that
35:34
like really think they're in debate class and I'm like if they just prove that they are right on the a specific
35:40
issue then they win and I'm like I don't know how the last 6 eight years has not
35:46
taught you that that is not uh the plane in which this is fought on not exclusively yeah you're trying to debate
35:52
this person and then they just reply yeah you're Little Marco
35:57
and you're like what yeah nanny nanny boo boo yeah you little Marco when I look ahead to this year
36:04
this election doesn't seem funny at all I get why people want to tune it out I get why people it feels super familiar I
36:10
get why it doesn't Inspire folks to be as plugged in as they were in the 2017 and 2018 but it also feels like that's
36:17
part of the lack of attention that's being brought to it is the fact that it doesn't feel like it has that sort of
36:22
mass resonance do you think this election like am I just saying this to early and some of this stuff will come
36:29
around they're like is this election will it be funny like will it will it be
36:34
fun have no idea um I think this election is going to be tense I don't think it'll ever truly be resolved or
36:42
recognized um I'm I'm less concerned about this election and more concerned with what this election means for the
36:48
future of politics in America and whether or not we can still have people that are a total Force attempting to be
36:55
in the driver's seat of our government yeah yeah if Biden did he listens to
37:00
this podcast he calls you up and says okay give me some jokes to add to my speech you got anything absolutely I'm
37:06
not available I I do not want the stress of writing the joke that makes people
37:13
finally listen to some of your policy points he said good luck Mr res I am not
37:20
going back to the Apollo I didn't did it y thank you I
37:25

37:32
hit me up yeah thank you so much for your time we really appreciate it and uh I'm a big fan so thanks for helping us
37:38
out hey thank you that's the runner for Thursday April
37:45
25th 2024 now the rundown it's week two of Donald Trump's
37:51
criminal trial in Manhattan where he's accused of falsifying business records to cover up an affair with ad do film
37:58
actress Stormy Daniels one Wednesday morning we caught up with our colleague Jonah bramwit who's been in the court
38:05
room each day this week he says if you haven't been following along closely so far you've missed a very short amount of
38:14
time in which so much has happened so much has happened we've gotten opening
38:19
statements from the prosecution and the defense and we've gotten our first witness opening statements are kind of
38:26
an overture it's where the lawyers lay out what their cases are going to look like what they hope to do is say here is
38:34
the story we're going to tell and then when they're telling that story the jurors will recognize ah I remember this
38:39
from the opening and here's what I'm supposed to think about it and the prosecutors told a really fascinating
38:45
story about a conspiracy that was hatched at Trump Tower in 2015 between
38:51
Donald Trump his lawyer at the Time Michael Cohen and David pecker of the national Inquirer and the first Witness
38:58
and the conspiracy prosecutors said was essentially an agreement to promote
39:03
positive stories about Trump in the National Inquirer and other tabloids owned by Ami and to suppress negative
39:09
stories and the suppression of the negative stories is how you get to the crime that prosecutors have actually
39:15
charged here and the defense had not necessarily competing narrative per se
39:21
but an alternative explanation of what had happened and they explained two different things they explained that Trump had tried to win the election
39:28
which is not a crime and they said that Michael Cohen had been reimbursed for Legal Services which is also not a crime
39:35
so their argument was essentially there's not much here and don't let the
39:40
prosecutors fool you into thinking there is as for Trump during jury selection there was a lot of news about Trump
39:46
sleeping and I will say that jury selection is quite boring so I don't fully blame him for sleeping he's been
39:53
more animated these past two days of the actual witness test testimony and to me
39:58
and to other people on our team he's looked much angrier so he seems more engaged and more upset in a way that we
40:05
haven't seen and here's what comes next David pecker will continue to testify on Thursday he'll pick right up and then
40:12
we'll get more witnesses we don't know the order of the witnesses yet we expect that Michael Cohen will testify we have
40:18
no sense of whether Trump will testify Trump loves to defend himself to speak up on his own behalf he believes himself
40:24
to be quite good at it and I think for people who are devoted to the former president they see that as correct they do trust and believe him but testifying
40:32
in this case would come with real real risks for Trump so whether he is going
40:38
to testify or not will be an open question I think until we actually see him take the stand or declined to do so
40:45
meanwhile on Tuesday hello Florida Joe Biden campaigned in Tampa
40:52
next week one of the nation's most extreme anti-abortion law will take effect here in Florida
40:57
it's criminalizing reproductive Health Care from before women even know whether they're pregnant I mean this is bizarre
41:04
his speech was focused on abortion let's be real clear there's one person
41:11
responsible for this nightmare and he's acknowledging he brags about it Donald
41:16
Trump and on Donald Trump it was Donald Trump who ripped away the rights of
41:21
freedom of women in America that'll be all of us who restore those rights for women in America
41:28
[Music] also the Pennsylvania primary was held on Tuesday Donald Trump and Joe Biden
41:35
both on handedly but you know Nikki Haley got you know a really good
41:40
percentage not even in the race in a warning sign for Republicans more than 150,000 people in the state voted for
41:47
Nikki Haley who dropped out of the race more than a month ago also in Pennsylvania Progressive
41:54
congresswoman summer Lee won her Democratic primary fending off a moderate
41:59
Challenger Lee has been a prominent critic of Israel's military actions in Gaza which was a central focus in the
42:06
