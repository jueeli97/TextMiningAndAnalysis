Project 2025 Is Everywhere. Here's What It Means.


0:02
[Music] just a couple days after President Biden's disastrous debate performance
0:08
I'm telling y'all you better show up and show out with them ballads I'm being Ser
0:15
actress Taraji P Henson gave a speech at the BET Awards they are attacking our
0:20
most vulnerable citizens the project 2025 plan is not a game look it up where
0:28
she mentioned something called project 2025 a republican blueprint for the next
0:34
conservative president presumably Donald Trump and in the days since it seems
0:41
like it's everywhere more and more people online are talking about project 2025 we should all be absolutely
0:49
terrified of what's in Project 2025 on social media platforms like
0:55
Instagram and Tik Tok the farite conservatives are revealing their hand now they have given us the blueprint on
1:01
what they want to enact in the next conservative presidency a lot of people have expressed alarm if you cannot
1:07
afford to move out of this country within the next year I need you to take project 2025 and Trump potentially
1:12
getting reelected very seriously I just read what Trump's project 2025 would do to lgbtq people and you've got to see
1:19
this so project 2025 is what Donald Trump and the Republican Party are trying to push through and it will literally change the way that our
1:25
government works and it's so insane and let's go through it it is a thorough plan for how they're going to change the
1:31
country fundamentally to a place that is unrecognizable to almost all of us and
1:36
Democrats are seizing on to that concern particularly as President Biden faces
1:41
mounting questions about the viability of his candidacy on Wednesday morning Biden
1:47
himself invoked project 2025 on social media project 2025 will destroy America
1:54
look it up while Donald Trump has also posted recently claiming ignorance Trump
2:00
wrote I know nothing about project 2025 I have no idea who's behind it I disagree with some of the things they're
2:06
saying and some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal anything they do I wish them
2:11
luck but I have nothing to do with them this is made for an awkward reality with
2:17
Biden pinning project 2025 on Trump As Trump is distancing himself from it
2:22
saying he's never heard of it and doesn't know who's behind it so today what project 2025 is and
2:31
where it fits in this mess of an election from The New York Times I'm
2:37
mustad hearnen this is the run
2:42
up ladies and Gentlemen please welcome to the stage Heritage foundation's director of project
2:49
2025 Paul [Music]
2:55
Dan a little over a year ago the conservative Heritage Foundation held a
3:00
summit launching project 2025 uh good morning everyone thank you for uh coming
3:07
we what we're doing here is Project 2025 what is Project 2025 it is everyone here this is the
3:15
movement we are going to PR be prepared day one January 20 2025 to hit the
3:22
ground running as a as conservatives to really help the next president back in
3:27
2016 when Trump first won the presidency his team and a lot of conservative
3:32
groups weren't prepared for what came next especially the many decisions around policy and
3:39
Personnel so this time they are thinking ahead and planning for a trump Victory
3:46
but what we're doing is systematically preparing to March into office and bring
3:51
a new Army of aligned trained and essentially weaponized conservatives
3:58
ready to do battle against the Deep State at its core that's what project 2025 is it's a plan
4:07
to we came out with our policy book mandate for leadership this sets the table for what conservatives want in
4:14
their next standard bear it includes an over 800 page handbook full of policy
4:20
proposals we our common theme is to take down the administrative State the
4:25
bureaucracy and you're going to um yeah it's it's not as easy easy done as it is
4:31
said a lot of them are red meat for conservatives like the desire to expand
4:36
executive power crack down on abortion rights and use the military for
4:41
immigration enforcement but some proposals are more Niche like getting rid of the Department
4:47
of Education criminalizing pornography and eliminating the term gender from
4:53
every Federal rule agency regulation contract Grant and piece of legislation
4:59
that exists and many of the ideas don't align with the broader electorate which might
5:06
be one reason Trump is trying to distance himself from the project my colleague Jonathan Swan along with
5:13
Maggie Haberman and Charlie Savage has been reporting on Project 2025 and
5:18
Chum's plans for a possible second term for a long time hey
5:23
mate how's it going good so I called him
5:29
every 4 years there is an effort by conservative groups to prepare policy
5:36
plans and Personnel for the next Republican
5:42
Administration what is different this time is the scale of it so you you have
5:48
this effort that's been called project 2025 it's an initiative that is led by
5:53
the Heritage Foundation uh conservative think tank that is very powerful but
5:59
what's different is they have convened more than a 100 different conservative
6:05
groups under their umbrella and under the leadership of the Heritage Foundation they're working together to
6:11
develop lists of people to fill Administration jobs in a second term uh
6:17
people who have been vetted as ideologically sound and in many cases
6:23
people who are beli to be loyal or would be loyal to Donald Trump and on the
6:28
policy side they're developing both big picture principles that they wrote a very extensive almost 900 page book um
6:36
on on all this and they're also developing more granular plans so they're actually writing executive
6:42
orders right now that could be really just picked up and used by Donald Trump
6:48
if he gets elected they are not affiliated with the Trump campaign but
6:54
project 2025 the people who are leading both the personnel and the policy side of the initiative are people who served
7:01
in senior roles in the first term of the Trump Administration and crucially
7:06
they're people who Trump himself trusts and they would likely serve in senior roles in a second term I will just
7:13
signal out two in particular on the policy side Russell vote who was uh the
7:20
director of The Office of Management and budget in the first Trump Administration he is close to Donald Trump trump likes
7:25
him talks to him trusts him he will probably serve in a important role in a second term on the Personnel side John
7:33
mckinty he was Donald Trump's body man initially and then became the head of presidential personnel and Trump
7:40
empowered him at the start of 2020 to purge the federal government of people who are disloyal to him so he is playing
7:47
a key role in shaping these uh of the Personnel list for project 2025 MH okay
7:53
so we know that Trump has said that he knows nothing about the project we also know that Donald Trump isn't always an
7:59
honest narrator so how should we separate his claims of not knowing anything about the project and the
8:05
reality that some of those people are involved in its creation well two things
8:11
can be true at once there is no human on earth less interested in that 900 page
8:19
book of policies than Donald Trump I guarantee you he hasn't cracked open
8:25
that book in fact not only is he not interested in transition plan
8:30
he's actively hostile to it so when you talk to people who are trying to get him to focus on your transition you know Mr
8:38
President you're probably going to win this election this is what many of them believe we really need to get focused on
8:43
planning for the transition to power they cannot get him to engage on that subject he sees it as a distraction from
8:50
the task of winning the election so he may well know very little about this he he knows the people involved very well
8:58
but he's not exactly in In The Weeds on this however that's a separate question from you know how many of these plans
9:04
will end up being implemented and the likely answer is a
9:10
reasonable amount of them because there is really significant overlap between what is being put out through project
9:16
2025 and the plans that Donald Trump himself has articulated in campaign speeches and in the policy section on
9:23
his website which is called agenda 47 I'll give you a few examples that are
9:29
a Salient the project 2025 immigration plans are extremely aggressive including
9:37
militarizing the southern border Donald Trump himself has promised the biggest deportation operation in American
9:44
history including using the military to uh for domestic law enforcement as it
9:50
relates to immigration enforcement another area would be the Department of Justice project 2025 has questioned or
9:57
or challenged the idea rejected actually is is the better word uh the notion that
10:02
the Department of Justice should operate uh with some degree of independence from White House political control that suits
10:09
Donald Trump very well he has already promised to appoint a quote unquote real
10:14
special prosecutor to quote unquote go after Joe Biden and his family that
10:20
would destroy the post-watergate norm of a justice department that operates with
10:25
some degree of Independence particularly with investigations from White House political control so when you read the
10:32
Mandate document U that we just talked about when you read the project 2025 materials you find a huge amount of
10:38
overlap the book mentions Donald Trump you know hundreds of times Praises him
10:43
and many of his instincts are reflected in that document which stands to reason because the people who wrote it are
10:50
people that he had in senior positions in his first term mhm how seriously do
10:56
you think we should take this project we should take it seriously as we have in our reporting but we should not treat it
11:02
as Trump campaign plans and there are certain areas where I think it would be misleading to do that Donald Trump
11:08
himself has really bucked the social conservative faction of his party on
11:15
abortion recently he has opposed A National Abortion ban much to the
11:20
conation of many of these anti-abortion groups I think there's a decent chance
11:26
given that he doesn't exactly have deeply held views on a abortion and he thinks that the issue is politically
11:32
toxic I think there's a decent chance that in that area for example he doesn't go as far as they want him to go you
11:39
know so project 2025 should be treated very seriously because the people writing it are likely to play serious
11:45
roles in the second term also because Donald Trump himself is not exactly a
11:50
policy wonk and you know will really appoint people and turn over authority
11:56
to them there were whole huge areas of the federal ederal government to which he paid almost no attention when he was
12:02
president and the people that he'd appointed to lead those agencies who were under almost no supervision from
12:08
Donald Trump basically did what they wanted to do and just sort of were waiting for the phone call to say don't stop doing what you're doing and the
12:14
phone call really never came so there's a decent chance if he appoints certain people that project 2025 puts up that a
12:22
lot of very conservative policy happens in some of these agencies and in many cases very radical policy represents a
12:29
significant break with past norms and precedents mhm I think one of the
12:34
reasons this is getting so much attention is because of the words of the leader of the Heritage Foundation the the lead author Paul Dan said last year
12:42
quote what we're doing is systematically preparing to March into office and bring a new Army of aligned trained and
12:48
essentially weaponized conservatives ready to do battle against the Deep State and Kevin Roberts the Heritage
12:53
Foundation president that you mentioned said recently quote that we are in the process of a second American re ution
12:59
which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be I mean this language
13:05
feels pretty dramatic how should we think about the words that are coming from these project 2025 leaders in
13:11
relationship to the policy that we see on the page well the the the quote you just gave
13:17
from Paul Dan Trump himself goes further than that in his own words he talks about rooting out the marxists and the
13:24
Communists from the government destroying the Deep State I guess my point is project 2025 is important and
13:31
it's you know they are going to have to turn to parts of it Donald Trump his team doesn't have to bandwidth to find
13:38
4,000 people to staff you know every time a new party gets into Power 4,000
13:44
political appointees are replaced Donald Trump himself will pick the flashy the big cabinet role Secretary of State
13:50
whatever but below that level he's not going to be going oh yes I know who should be the assistant Secretary of
13:56
whatever you know they are going to turn to groups like this in their list so it's important but like you don't need
14:04
project 2025 to sort of divine and discern what Donald Trump plans to do
14:10
he's told us many times and has put it on his campaign website so it's like oh
14:16
we've got the magic key it's like no we don't have the freaking magic key we don't need the magic key he's told us
14:22
many times and in many cases gone much further than some of these people have
14:28
but like I don't know just play a tape of trump like at some of these rallies and you
14:34
you no I'm totally I'm totally with you I mean this has come up a lot because we get questions about covering project
14:40
2025 and it just become shorthand for I think for a lot of people's understanding of what trumpism looks
14:45
like something that stuck out to me were the things that were in this that he doesn't really talk about and seemed to
14:51
have a much bigger focus on kind of what some people call culture War uh gender
14:56
identity issues about treatment of the LGBT TQ Community uh about mentions of gender and Dei programs being a big
15:03
priority where I've always found it very interesting that like it doesn't seem like Trump has been as obsessed with
15:08
those issues as some other corners of the Republican Party how should we understand where uh those things kind of
15:17
fit in the overall policy possibilities of a second Trump term I I would draw a
15:23
bit of a distinction within that category that you just laid out I think a second Trump term absolutely would go
15:29
to war against any diversity equity and inclusion programs within the federal
15:34
government and would absolutely go after anything they could do using their power
15:40
to curb transgender uh but like any federal protections for Trans exactly like those
15:47
two things I have no doubt about where Trump differs from where the social conservative movement has been is on gay
15:54
rights he he doesn't really care like for example the Republican platform that Trump has just pushed through over the
16:02
quiet objections that hasn't really bubbled out that much publicly but social conservatives basically got
16:08
bulldozed here um the previous Republican platform defines marriage as between one man and one woman Trump very
16:15
deliberately does not have that in this platform so I think Trump sees that
16:20
fight he doesn't really care about that fight he thinks it's already been won and decided by the left and is not
16:27
really fighting uh a rear guard action on that but I think definitely on Dei and trans issues he will be very
16:36
aggressive more with Jonathan after the break you mentioned kind of the
16:43
Republicans are out with the new platform and we did want to ask you about that can you take me through a little bit more of what happened there
16:50
and how should we think of this Republican platform versus what he says on the trail or even policy documents
16:56
like project 2025 well the platform if you read it is a
17:02
couple things number one this is a trump document they completely shut out the
17:09
usual activists who shape these documents the platform was developed in great secrecy by a very small number of
17:17
trump operatives and a and interes reviewed and with input from Donald
17:22
Trump himself like really like read you know here I wanted to say this and not this I'm not suggesting he like edited
17:28
at every line but really did have input particularly on the sensitive issues like abortion and gay marriage but the
17:35
document is a testament to Donald Trump's power that's the way I see this
17:41
document it's not particularly useful as a blueprint for what he might do in a second term because it's so vague I mean
17:48
one thing they did very deliberately from this document is just cut it down I mean the old document was like 67 Pages
17:54
like they slashed it slash SL SL slash and it's a lot of the sections are just
17:59
pum the foreign policy section is so just platitudes vague you know by Design
18:08
they really didn't want to give the Democrats opportunities to pick off targets and say look how radical and
18:13
extreme this guy is so to me the document because it in a couple of key
18:19
ways defied social conservatives and they really didn't kick up a huge storm
18:26
even though they were shut out of the process and really bulldozed to me it's
18:31
just an indication of How It's a new level of power and dominance that Donald Trump has over the Republican party and
18:37
I think it foreshadows something about how a second term Donald Trump
18:43
Administration would look like he still faced some degree of resistance in his first term from elected Republicans
18:50
wasn't a huge amount but it was a bit and I just I think that has eroded really substantially in the last four to
18:57
six years so that's what I see in the platform you're right cuz I mean it it doesn't feel like a traditional party
19:03
platform it's 20 bullet points that are written in all caps that kind of feel
19:09
like just the versions of the rally chance that we see examples like uh
19:14
unite our country and bring it new levels of success isn't a policy
19:19
platform more than it is like an affirmation in general when there's a couple of things that feel more specific
19:25
like you know cancel the electric vehicle mandate or keep men out of women's sports and the kind of culture
19:31
things you were talking about earlier but the foreign policy section as you would say isn't much of a section at all
19:37
just prevent World War III restore peace in Europe and the Middle East and bring the great Iron Dome missile defense
19:44
Shield over our country all made in America that's more of a a plat to you're Point platitude than a
19:52
platform yeah and look there's sections that are more fleshed out immigration
19:57
and trade like yes there are the 20 points or whatever and then you know they've got paragraphs on some of these
20:03
sections like later in the document but yes it is a very very very paired down
20:09
document with far fewer policy specifics which was again developed in secrecy by
20:16
Donald Trump's team this is Donald Trump not the Republican party this is Donald Trump dictating the platform in a way
20:24
that goes far beyond what we saw in 2016 yeah you know it strikes me that in this
20:31
platform and in Project 2025 we're talking about a written policy text for
20:36
someone who famously kind of governed you know from their hip you know from the last person who talked to him easily
20:42
convinced I guess one question I have is it feels like the rise of project 2025 in terms of the Zeitgeist is partially
20:49
because of an increased fear that a lot of Democrats have on the possibility of a second Trump presidency if someone
20:56
were to understand what Trump 2.0 would look like what is that big difference from last time to this time I think it's
21:04
two parts I think number one he is not going to do what he did in the first
21:09
term to the extent that he did in terms of appointing people who saw their job
21:15
as protecting America and the world from Donald Trump uh so you had a secretary
21:21
of defense James Mattis who fundamentally had a fundamentally different worldview from Donald Trump
21:27
who believed in Alliance who had a different view of NATO and who really
21:32
saw himself as someone who stood in the way between Donald Trump and what he viewed as chaos you had someone like a
21:39
Gary con economic advisor who fundamentally disagreed with Trump on tariffs and trade I think you're going
21:46
to see people who are much more like-minded and also many of the people that Donald Trump kind of became comfortable with in the last year of his
21:53
first term people who are much more ideologically aligned and also who
21:58
learned a lot in the four years they served in government um in the Trump Administration so Steven Miller in 2020
22:08
was a different Steven Miller than existed in 2017 he had the same ideology
22:13
but he learned a lot became much more effective at figuring out how to get what he wanted through muscle it through
22:20
the executive branch how to operate the levers of power so I I do think you have
22:25
people who've gained valuable experience who know who know what they're doing to a larger extent and also who are much
22:31
more ideologically aligned I think that's the biggest difference mhm that makes sense uh if someone's is there
22:38
something from this document that you could say would definitely or almost certainly happen in the second Trump term I'm thinking about the plank like
22:45
the immigration policy where there seems to be an alignment between what Donald Trump says what a project 2025 says and
22:51
what a lot of the Republican Bay says is there any place that you think if Donald Trump wins again uh this is sure to
22:57
happen yeah for sure I mean you mentioned immigration I I would mention the Civil Service like in his first ter
23:03
and I've written a lot about this um in October of 2020 Donald Trump issued an executive order that is short-handed as
23:09
schedule F which effectively reclassifies as many as 50,000 career
23:17
government officials as effectively political appointees removing their
23:22
employment protections making it much easier to fire them and replace them with people deemed to be loyal to the
23:30
president and to his agenda so will Donald Trump reimplement that absolutely
23:36
he said he will so that's an example of an area where there is perfect overlap and I fully anticipate that that will be
23:45
implemented if you could kind of point to Lynch pins that you think with underg Trump in the second term just what would
23:52
be the areas that you think would be the most important to understand what Trump 2.0 could look like what what would
23:58
those be immigration which is in terms of policy his biggest Focus his his most
24:06
and frankly is is the area in which there could be the most aggressive and disruptive change like if he really does
24:12
follow through with what he's talking about on mass deportations the effects of that the
24:18
flow on effects in terms of uprooting people from their communities and
24:23
economic effects like you would be profound and then this other area of EX
24:28
I power which is centralizing power and removing obstruction to his power within
24:34
the executive branch rooting out Independence uh any wherever it exists
24:39
in the executive branch I think is another really important area and the third one I'd single out is the justice department how does he use that
24:46
department he's talked about getting back at the people who've come after him you know at different times he said my
24:51
you know retribution will be how successful I make the country because think he understands that politically
24:58
it's not popular to be talking about locking up his enemies but he's also said he will prosecute Joe Biden so I
25:05
think the way he uses the doj will be one of the biggest stories in a second
25:11
term MH you know one of the goals many people seem here to have is to make sure the Trump Administration are ready to
25:17
kind of act on a policy agenda in day one how prepared do you think he and his team are to do that I don't think very
25:24
prepared at all I think Heritage and f 25 will have all the plans ready but the
25:30
Trump team still hasn't formed their transition team and a large reason for
25:36
that is because Donald Trump himself just won't engage it's very hard to get him to engage on uh in discussing
25:42
transition planning one of the reasons why 2016 and 2017 his first year was such a
25:48
mess was because you know he he appointed Chris Christie to uh oversee
25:53
his transition and then decided that Christie was the wrong guy for it they
25:58
literally threw Christy's materials in the trash can Steve banon did and they started again and it was just a mess now
26:06
if they actually get their act together this time they have the potential to be far more organized far more effective
26:13
than they were in 2017 and you know if I'm going to lean towards making a
26:19
prediction I think they will be more effective because the people involved learned a lot and they will have these
26:25
materials that have been developed and despite what Donald Trump says they will turn to some of this both personnel and
26:34
policy plans because it exists and it fills a vacuum and it's been developed
26:40
by people that he largely trusts so I think it's an important project I think
26:45
we should pay very close attention to it but with some nuance and sophistication
26:51
rather than just sort of oh this is the Trump campaign yeah you know we've been hearing from some people who are re-evaluating a trump presiden because
26:58
of Biden's weak debate performance what are the central things you think people should know that we do know through
27:03
reporting like yours about what that could look like well again I don't think there's a huge amount of mystery here
27:10
like Donald Trump has said all of this out loud like is not this is not some
27:16
great investigative project I mean like I don't know what people read his
27:21
freaking campaign website go and look at it he or or look at his like he said it out loud listen to a couple of tapes
27:28
like you know sort of it's not woodwood and Bernstein here I mean it's like I
27:35
think actually people like people want it to be Woodward and burn it's actually
27:41
a comforting thing secr for it to be Woodward and burn what's the secret plan
27:46
there's no secret plan he said it all out loud like what what are you talking
27:52
about thank you so much Jonathan for your time um we appreciate it pleasure thanks for having me
27:58
[Music] so like Jonathan said project 2025 isn't
28:07
some secret document or a complete picture of what the Trump's second term could look
28:13
like but it also doesn't feel right to Simply call it a policy
28:18
handbook it's a stark reminder of the stakes of this November's election and
28:24
the binary choice that voters have in front of them and EMB battled Democratic
28:29
candidate who most Americans think is too old to serve four more years versus
28:35
a convicted felon who is backed by a conservative movement that is looking to fundamentally reshape
28:42
America and has the plan to do it
28:49
[Music]
29:16
that's the runner for Thursday July 11 2024 and now the
29:21
rundown this has been a crucial week for Joe Biden as he faces mounting pressure
29:26
over his Fitness to serve in office as of Wednesday evening the
29:31
chorus of people calling for Biden to step aside included nine house Democrats Senator Peter Welch a Vermont
29:39
Democrat wrote In The Washington Post that Biden should withdraw Senator Michael Benet of Colorado had said that
29:45
Trump will win if Biden is the Democratic nominee an actor and Democratic activist George Clooney who
29:51
was just with the president last month at a fundraiser he hosted called for an open convention in a guest essay for the
29:58
the New York Times but for now it still doesn't look like President Biden or his
30:03
allies will be swayed so we wanted to hear directly from someone who is sticking with the president what's their
30:10
reasoning and their plan to win so we call California Democratic
30:16
congressman roana who represents part of the Bay Area and has been a strong supporter of President Biden
30:28
hello it's is thed Herer from The New York Times is this Congressman Conor hi sorry about that I was trying to connect
30:34
it didn't work oh okay but we got you now that's what's most important I appreciate you taking our time of course
30:40
you know we're talking on Wednesday evening and of course many things can still happen but from where it looks like we're sitting right now it doesn't
30:46
seem like there's any major change of foot and President Biden is still digging in on the course to be the Democratic nominee I wanted to first
30:53
start with just the BR and broader question do you think that President Biden is the best ratic candidate suit
30:59
it to be Trump I believe that he has the votes in the nomination process and it's
31:06
his decision on uh what to do are there other candidates in our party who could
31:12
defeat Donald Trump absolutely many of them though are unknown and it's taking
31:18
a risk and the question of whether he's the best is a decision that uh he needs
31:24
to make with the input of his family close advisers members of Congress and
31:30
the Grassroots activists I guess voters have consistently said they thought Biden was
31:35
too old for a second term concerns that were only reinforced during the debate and its aftermath what should the Biden
31:41
campaign do to address those concerns he needs to be out there he needs to have town halls I would have a 60-minute town
31:48
hall with voters where they have open questions and he answers those questions
31:53
uh he needs to continue to be out meeting with uh different voters and the
31:59
media and he needs to prosecute the case against Donald Trump as well as offer a vision for what he wants the next four
32:06
years to be yeah I'm curious what you're hearing from constituents you know polling would tell us that President
32:11
Biden has put the Democrats in a tough position in a lot of key places to win I know that you're out in California but
32:17
you're someone who has been an open surrogate for Biden I remember seeing you in New Hampshire making the case for
32:23
him uh uh Over The Challengers that were there what have you heard since the debate about voters confidence in
32:29
President Biden I've heard mixed things I've heard uh some voters and activists
32:35
reach out saying we absolutely have to stay with President Biden he's had a great four years he can make the case
32:40
he's a known quantity I've had other people have concerns that he is no longer the same Joe Biden and that we he
32:48
can't win and he's gonna uh hurt our chances down ballot so I've heard both from people and it's I think why this
32:55
debate is so so polarized yeah yeah you know I'm thinking about some of the um kind of messaging changes that have
33:02
happened for the Biden campaign since the debate they've acknowledged his age they've acknowledged that he kind of
33:07
speaks and talks differently and I kind of wonder why that stuff didn't happen before as I said I saw you in New
33:12
Hampshire at a time when polling and voters were telling us even back then that they thought President Biden was
33:18
old and maybe too old for a second term why do you think it took so long it wasn't a mistake for Democrats to take
33:24
so long to address voter concerns specifically when it came to age well the voter concerns were raised
33:29
throughout the primaries and the president did very well in the primaries now granted his opposition was Dean Phillips but he still was getting uh
33:36
robust uh percentages the uncommitted was 15% but he was getting a strong
33:41
support uh and he had a lot of support from the Democratic activist base uh and
33:47
so I think that people hadn't seen the performance at the debate and obviously
33:52
that didn't go well and now there's been more concern whether he's up for a bigger risk
33:58
yeah you know I hear you but I also you know we reported back at the time that the White House was doing very explicit efforts to reach out to people to kind
34:05
of make them uh stay distant from the primary to make sure folks stayed in the fold that they were part of the reason
34:10
that they didn't get more uh robust Challengers on the question of age was it a real primary can we use that
34:17
primary as a as a proof point of Voters having a a place to weigh in about this
34:24
question well it was not a contested Primary in a rigorous sense I mean AD Dean Phillips launched the challenge but
34:29
it he didn't have the name ID or the resources to really to fight a a full primary campaign but the reason people
34:36
didn't run is not because of the White House called them the reason they didn't run is they saw the poll numbers I I saw
34:41
the poll numbers I mean I was never contemplating running but I saw the poll numbers for Biden and he was very very
34:47
very strong among Democratic primary voters remember this was coming off a big win in the midterm where we
34:54
overperformed and so I I think that that wouldn't be the case today you would probably have a Wimer or n beatum but it
35:01
was the case back then it does feel like there's a little distance between the seriousness of the stakes that Democrats
35:07
have communicated to voters and to others for a long time and this idea that it's just President Biden's
35:13
decision on this front why wouldn't you uh kind of call for something more actively if you felt that he wasn't
35:19
mounting a type of campaign that could beat Donald Trump in November because you know as I hear from Democrats
35:25
democracy is on the line but democracy ultimately is respecting the Democratic process by which we we
35:31
had a nominee Chosen and and if others chose not to run that still was the process that no one prohibited them or
35:38
discouraged them explicitly from from running and so I think it has to be a
35:43
process where President Biden is making that decision and given the the space to
35:49
make that decision and I guess I still have confidence in in him to to be
35:54
cleare eyed uh in making that decision right now do you think the Democrats are in a position to win the presidency
36:01
House and Senate in November I do I think we're the underdog but I think we can run a campaign if we
36:07
talk about the issues if we talk about the fact that the we've had record job creation in de-industrialized parts of
36:14
America the very parts that Trump said have been left out Joe Biden in the last three years has created more jobs than
36:20
in the last 20 years in those areas if we talk about our workingclass agenda of universal child care of expanding
36:26
Medicare of increasing Social Security that's what we need to do to win you know I I I hear that and I definitely
36:32
don't think there's any uh kind of uh debate about the policy accomplishments of this Administration but we do see the
36:38
Biden kind of have a unique liability specifically around age that's causing voters not to really credit that with
36:44
looking ahead to the next four years how do you kind of respond to the question that no matter if Biden was a successful
36:50
president in this Administration that this unique liability around age stops
36:55
people from being excited about him in terms of the next Administration well I think that we have to go out and talk
37:02
about an agenda that excites people and then the president obviously has to go out and convey that agenda but that
37:08
agenda needs to be centering the working class and talking about what we're going to do to improve their Liv but you know
37:14
one of the things that comes through in our reporting is that there's a lot of legitimate concerns from voters around the question of the president's age when
37:21
as a representative you say you've heard those concerns also even if they've been mixed about what to do with it when did
37:27
that start did that just start at the debate I can't imagine so because we've heard about people being worried about
37:32
the president's age for a long time well I think there there's a difference I think that there is a sense that oh he
37:37
too old he's going to be 81 uh in an in an abstract way of do we really want to
37:43
feel the nominee who's going to be 81 I think post debate there's been a concern of can is Joe Biden up to the task of
37:51
campaigning can he uh make the case uh and that it's become more specific it's
37:58
no longer should we be running an 81 year old is is Joe Biden the same person
38:04
okay well that would be my last question how do we evaluate that at what point does I mean what are you looking for I
38:11
mean I know that there's these interviews coming up is there a deadline I mean it does seem as if like that's a
38:17
big question to just have there out in the open like what should we be looking forward to say how you're evaluating
38:22
that decision again I think the decision is the president what I can do is uh
38:29
convey to our leadership uh what we should be sharing with the president and that is the feedback we're getting about
38:35
whether he can win this race but ultimately he needs to sit down with his family with independent advisors and
38:42
search his conscience and say can he beat Donald Trump is he the best person to beat Donald Trump and uh he needs to
38:49
make that judgment I trust him in making that judgment with surrounded by handed feedback uh but you know what I have
38:56
told the White House and my leadership and would tell him if the president ever asked is that there's a lot of
39:02
conservatives president about your age and your ability to make the case and uh
39:07
you need to continue to address that and you're comfortable with that being President Biden's decision and his
39:12
family's along I am comfortable about it being his decision because he won the votes in
39:18
a primary process and I believe if we're going to campaign on Democracy we have to respect democracy and that means
39:25
respecting that it's his decision but I have confidence that he would make the right decision if he F felt that he was
39:31
not the best person to defeat Donald Trump thank you so much for your time Congressman we really appreciate it
