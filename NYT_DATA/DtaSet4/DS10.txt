Can Celebrities Make a Difference? Your 2024 Election Questions, Answered


0:02
if the 2024 presidential election were a road trip I think we'd be at the part
0:08
where you start to wonder Are We There Yet we know who the candidates are but
0:15
there's still such a long way to go until November and one of the things I've noticed about the questions that
0:21
you all have been sending in is that you're starting to mix it up who do you think Trump is going to pick for VP and
0:29
how do you think that that's going to influence voters you're asking about different people what makes a swing state different races I was curious how
0:37
will other elections this year senate elections Governor Congress be affected
0:45
by the fact that this year is such a high stakes presidential election
0:50
anything to distract from the top of the ticket so today we're answering your
0:56
questions by setting the main characters of 2024 aside and talking about people
1:02
who aren't named Trump or Biden some are candidates some are officials and some are a little
1:09
weirder but they all could have an impact on the election come fall on the road to
1:16
20124 we're not there yet but we are getting a little closer from The New York Times I'm estad
1:23
hearon this is the runup yo
1:30
hello finally hi a long time coming I swear to
1:38
God the years in the making years in the making okay so let me introduce someone
1:44
who's going to help me answer your listener questions this is Jess bidg good she writes the on politics
1:49
newsletter for the times and also a pal Jess how's it going I'm so glad
1:56
you're on the runup hi estad it is so exciting to be here you know right
2:01
before we started recording I was trying to remember where we first met do you remember I actually don't I don't
2:08
remember when we first met but I do remember when I knew we'd be friends forever what what what was I'm nervous
2:16
of what this answer is that would be the night that you ran
2:21
out of gas on the side of i93 on the way to an Elizabeth Warren event you were
2:26
covering Warren for the times I was covering her for the yes you called me you asked for a rescue
2:34
and I provided that rescue you did you did I was in a massive crisis on the
2:41
side of the road a crisis of my own making for the record I just simply was listening to a podcast and completely
2:46
ignored the gas tank ran out of gas in the middle of the highway in the middle of a snowstorm in New Hampshire and I
2:53
was like you know who would save me and so you very nicely came with uh
2:59
some some gas we loaded it up on the side of the road and we're so happy that you are back at the times after leaving
3:06
for a stent [Laughter] uh so here's what we're here to do Jess
3:12
we've gone through our listener questions and they're mostly focused about people who aren't Biden or Trump
3:18
but can still have a huge impact on this race in November and I figure that we could go through some of them um and
3:25
we're going to call on some help so I think Anna our lovely run up producer is going to help us go through some of
3:32
these questions Anna are you there hey guys hi Anna uh extremely helpful
3:37
conversation just now I feel like you know as someone who is in the car with aead while reporting a lot I should just
3:44
you know take a look at that gas every once in a while so how are we going to do this
3:51
yeah so I figure what we're going to do is we're going to call on what I am now
3:56
calling a run-up tradition we're going to use a wheel which if people don't
4:01
remember the last time we answered listener questions I brought instead a wheel of third party candidates we spun
4:07
it we talked about what was going on in the race at the time and so what I've done here is I've kind of you know
4:13
compiled some specific names that kind of speak to some of the listener questions that we've got but to be clear
4:19
Anna all of these names are names of people who could affect the race who are not named Joe Biden and Donald Trump yep
4:25
that's right so the names are Tammy Baldwin judge Cannon Larry Hogan
4:32
Kendrick Lamar Taylor Swift and
4:38
Cricket it's it's like yeah six people walking to a bar you
4:44
know like it's like it's like you know like I don't know if if
4:51
all these names have been in one sentence together but I'm glad we're here now uh okay so I will get to spinning
4:59
cool
5:07
[Music] [Laughter] [Music] I wasn't expecting the music Tammy
5:15
Baldwin yeah I mean I'll take this one I mean we were just in Wisconsin and one
5:21
of the things that really came through which I think is further reflected in the New York Times polling that we got
5:26
about swing States and Battlegrounds is that for a lot of Democrats there's a lot of good signs once you look
5:32
underneath the presidential level and so someone like Tammy Baldwin is the senator from Wisconsin who is running
5:38
for re-election and whose race is considered pretty critical for the hopes of Democrats trying to hold on to the
5:45
Senate but in a state like Wisconsin Baldwin stand's pretty unique she won her last Senate race by a significant
5:51
Wisconsin significant margin I think it was more than double digits and then when we talk to people this year there
5:57
everyone's in pretty much agreement that Baldwin is in a pretty good position to
6:02
win reelection and I think that speaks to a kind of larger Dynamic happening right now where if you look at the
6:09
Democratic party through the lens of Joe Biden there's all of these problems you can talk about and all of these signs of
6:15
dissatisfaction and erosion and and when Anna and I were in Wisconsin a couple
6:21
weeks ago there was a couple we met outside of a Walmart in Milwaukee Yeah we actually caught them as they were
6:26
finishing up their shopping how are how long have you been in Wisconsin are you a a longtime Badger I'm a longtime
6:32
Badger I was born in Wisconsin I love Wisconsin and this lady was a very enthusiastic Democrat she was wearing a
6:38
pin for climate change and voting I'm working about 20 hours a week to get out the vote wow wow yeah I'm determined
6:45
that's that's a parttime job well my slogan is I'm retired can't be
6:51
fired and you know she supported Biden um but where she really lit up was in
6:57
when we asked her about the down ballot possibilities when we asked her about what we heard from Governor iers about a
7:03
more moderate future for Democrats and Republicans the I wonder what you all
7:08
think of that like do you all think that there is a a something in the air where people want more bipartisanship want
7:15
more moderation or are those Corners so rigid that that seems like a pipe trink
7:20
well we appreciate Tony iers and uh Tammy Baldwin is also running for Senate
7:26
again her three issues are the three W's for wiconsin Wellness Water and work and
7:33
so she is trying to hit that Medium message that could appeal to all people
7:39
and I wish you well Tammy Baldwin I'll be supporting and donating to you and the only reason someone like a Baldwin
7:46
can win in the state of Wisconsin by a bigger margin than we typically see on the presidential level is because
7:52
there's some people who are willing to cross over and vote for a Republican and someone like her um for the as a
7:59
Democratic senator and so she does better in rural communities than we've seen a lot of Democrats typically do
8:05
keeps the margins fairly low in suburbs that are considered um Republican and then along with that motivates a
8:12
democratic base bn's up by 9% in the latest New York Times poll she has 49%
8:18
of registered voters and hovi only has 40 if you're up by 9% in Wisconsin that's basically a blowout at least at
8:24
this stage and so when you're seeing Republicans really focus their Senate efforts and places other than Wisconsin
8:30
that's sort of a tacit recognition that Baldwin as a candidate and the Democratic party there has pretty much
8:36
positioned someone to have an individual brand outside of what we think of as the problems with the national Democratic
8:43
party just that probably applies to more Senate candidates than just Baldwin I'm thinking about like the testers of the
8:50
world it does it does absolutely and there's another element of both Baldwin's race and tester's race who is
8:57
the Democratic senator represent presen ing Montana which is a pretty red state that has sent him back to the Senate
9:04
time again although he has what's going to be a tough battle up this year but another element that both of their races
9:10
have in common is this it's the kind of Republicans that they're running against
9:15
um this year Republicans really tried to
9:21
recruit wealthy candidates who could put a lot of money into their own races but
9:28
aren't super tested on a national stage Eric Hy who Tammy Baldwin is running
9:33
against in Wisconsin is one of these uh types of candidates Timothy sheii who
9:40
tester is running against in Montana is another um and so where in 2022 there
9:45
were some like really messy Republican primaries and sometimes the candidate that emerged from those wasn't seen as
9:51
the most like electable this time the Republican party got a lot of the candidates that they wanted but now
9:59
they're starting to find that because these Republicans aren't super tested not so much was known about them they're
10:06
having to contend with some like stories that don't make these candidates look
10:11
great they're in experienced yeah they're inexperienced they're new they're untested and that may also be
10:18
what's at play here with Tammy Baldwin's big lead um and we'll see how that plays
10:24
out in Montana in Ohio where sherid Brown is trying to hold the Democrats seat there in a pretty red State and
10:31
some others too MH you know I think back to what uh Mitch McConnell was saying in the 2022 midterms about candidate
10:37
equality we were talking about it so much in relationship to Donald Trump but this really is a a story going forward
10:43
and overall and so that's the challenge Republicans have is even if you know per the New York Times Battleground polling
10:49
Donald Trump is leading in several of those Battleground States we did not see that translate to Senate and other
10:55
candidates lower on the ballot that could tell you that it makes it easy for Biden to make up that room but it's
11:01
really not the full story here the other story is that the people running in those states have individual brands that
11:07
it's been harder for Republicans to really tarnish at this point yeah okay
11:12
let's keep rolling spinning
11:24
[Music] rather the next day name is Larry Hogan
11:30
Jess I'm going let you do this one since you actually spent the day with him for your newsletter sure sure uh so Larry
11:37
Hogan was the very popular governor of Maryland he was elected in 2014 handily
11:43
reelected in 2018 he is a republican who managed to make himself really popular
11:49
in a deep blue state in large part by there are a lot of reasons for his
11:54
popularity but one of them is that As Trump Rose in 2016 Hogan made it very
12:00
clear that he wanted nothing to do with him he didn't support him in 16 and once
12:06
Trump became president Hogan repeatedly clashed with him and much like we talked
12:11
about how Democrats like Timmy Baldwin have distanced themselves from the national Democratic brand Hogan did that
12:18
with the national Republican brand however he is now running for Senate and
12:25
this race is really going to be a test of whether a prom Trump critic a guy
12:31
who's really made himself out to be kind of one of the more prominent never trumpers in Republican politics right
12:39
now if there's any path forward for someone like that even in a deep blue
12:44
State he decided earlier this year to jump into the senate race after kind of
12:50
flirting with the idea of running for president uh possibly on the No Labels ticket which he ultimately decided not
12:56
to do former runup guest we talked to him about that yes yes absolutely so so the week that
13:02
the Senate border deal collapsed um he got a call from George W Bush saying
13:08
please run for Senate we need your voice kind of like almost it's like it's like two two figures who represent this kind
13:15
of bygone era of Republican politics saying let's get the band back together
13:20
and and see if we can do something going forward so he decided to run and the
13:25
question is going to be can someone like him him who left office with 77%
13:32
approval rating um back at the beginning of 2023 convinced the moderates and
13:39
independents and Democrats of Maryland to vote for him um and I think it's going to be really tough goinging
13:45
because voters in Maryland want there to be checks and balances on the power of
13:53
trump should he be president a second time and I think they're going to be really loathed to give Republicans
14:00
another vote in the Senate so as much as Hogan has built his own reputation in
14:07
Maryland he is going to be running against Trump and the idea of Trump's
14:13
power as much as he is against the Democrat who will be running against him
14:18
yeah I thought it was interesting that Larry Hogan even got in the senate race considering that when we were talking
14:24
last time he was so frankly pained by the idea
14:29
of the of where the Republican party has gone like when you talk to him how is he
14:35
trying to wrestle with his kind of consistent criticism of a Republican
14:42
party while now existing in it in a candidate way so I think for Hogan in a
14:49
way like Hope Springs Eternal you know he told me that he comes from what he
14:55
calls the Republican wing of the Republican party yeah yeah yeah he says
15:00
that he understands that Trump controls the party but he thinks that he can be a
15:06
reasonable Republican to kind of like bring Common Sense back to the party I
15:11
mean right there he's he's talking about going back right he's talking about going backwards he's talking about the
15:18
encouragement that he gets from George W bush and it's just not clear to me how these figures see the path forward and I
15:26
don't know who is going to work but it's it's uh it's notable I mean we have
15:32
asked these never Trump Republicans what is the plan at this point like for years
15:39
like like four years I we've been waiting on this sort of plan and one thing that I don't get is it keeps being
15:46
this like punt down the road right the plan is oh once he loses in 2020 the
15:51
part is going to move on or and then the 2020 primary there going to move on or when there's a conviction there's going
15:57
to move on and more so than me saying that that's an impossible thing to happen at this point
16:03
journalistically it's a thing we have no evidence of happening and so I'm like for Larry Hogan what are you pointing to
16:11
to say that the Republican electorate is looking for a non-trump option and that
16:17
that lane has shown harder and harder to actualize than um is true and work so we
16:23
know that there's donors who are anti-trump we know that there's individual voters who are antitrump we did you know and episode fully about
16:30
folks who didn't want to vote for Trump you know some of which were with disantis and some of which were with Haley but when you ask both of them were
16:36
you willing to give up on your principles in order to stop Trump and join together that answer was no right
16:43
and so I'm like I don't know what the Republican Coalition looks like going ahead without Trump and if you're Larry
16:51
Hogan you know you kind of need that to emerge right
17:01
after the break we keep [Music]
17:12
spinning all right y'all let's keep spinning
17:18
[Music]
17:24
[Laughter] okay so the next name is Kendrick
17:33
Lamar um I guess I got this one as a long time Kung Fu Kenny fan I you know
17:40
it's been a real couple weeks here but I think on the specific political angle we are talking about something that
17:46
happened last week which is that in the wake of Kendrick Lamar's very famous Feud with Drake which has now come and
17:53
gone as Drake has accepted his very obvious L um uh the Biden campaign put
18:00
out a diss track they played a slideshow of pictures of trump they play Kendrick
18:06
Lamar's Euphoria diss track in the background they changed the lyrics so
18:11
that it was taking aim at Donald Trump rather than Drake I hate the way that you walk over women's rights the way
18:18
that you talk about immigrants I hate the way that you dress I hate the way that you sneak this on Truth
18:25
social and the thing that I think this larger than you know Kendrick Lamar or
18:30
or anything else I think this also speaks to the kind of like pop culture moment and how uh campaigns try to see
18:37
themselves as both uh policy and politics um entities but also ones that
18:43
are looking to go viral and content create just as much as anything else I mean you've seen this in the way that
18:49
the Biden campaign has used Tik Tok to try to jump on latest trends even as Congress passes legislation that could
18:56
result in the Banning of the app but it feels also like a form of Outreach and
19:01
way to drive headlines this is the new version of earned media that you know more than a singular television ad these
19:09
campaigns are also looking to find themselves on music blogs and on rap blogs and be in different types of
19:16
places actually recently listened to an interview with the Biden campaign's digital director and he was saying
19:22
really explicitly how you know they have deprioritized more traditional media in
19:27
favor of trying to make sure that they find themselves in the places that people are going that are less
19:33
interested in politics and so I think we can see these things like distrack Tik Tock viral thirstiness content as part
19:41
of that but I also think like you know uh my brain also thinks back to in 2020
19:47
when Democrats got a lot of flak for how um they you know knelt with kin clof
19:53
after the murder of George Floyd and that kind of seemed like an inauthentic message for this party to be delivering
19:59
I think back to when Hillary Clinton said that she had hot sauce in her bag after Beyonce's formation video and for
20:06
the record I'm pretty sure Hillary Clinton actually did love hot sauce and it was legitimately in her back but it
20:12
came off and it became this kind of like it became this like moment that supposedly encapsulated the party's
20:18
relationship to Blackness and Black Culture so when they did the Donald Trump dis and relationship with Kendrick
20:24
Omar's Euphoria track last week the huge response online was about oh here they go again trying to use
20:31
stuff for votes it went viral in a somewhat negative way I don't want to characterize the whole response as that but that was a lot of the responses and
20:38
I do think that that's something that's in the air there's a very thin line between leaning into pop culture and
20:43
coming off as an authentic particularly when the candidate at the top of the ticket is 81 years old right no one in
20:50
here no one in the country thinks that Joe Biden actually knows what's happening in the Kendrick Lamar Drake
20:56
beef and some of that's okay right they understand it's a campaign and voters understand that but I think there is a
21:02
sense that political parties have only dealt with uh communities at the margins
21:09
really without any substance and so I think that that's what you know these
21:15
moments kind of exemplify is the tough road that campaigns have in terms of
21:20
trying to speak in an authentic language to communities that don't feel like they have represented them uh this is often
21:27
true around what type of events people do you know I've seen like people try to have taco trucks for Latino voters like
21:34
is that responding to a legitimate desire or is that a Pander and I think
21:40
the line between that is just if it comes off as authentic and it's just if it feels like it's in the natural
21:45
language of the candidate in campaign and right now you know I think that's hard to say for a Biden or a trump right
21:52
like when Trump engages with those communities everyone knows it's a photo op right like like he he's very very
21:59
transparently deals very disposa with these communities one of things Democrats try to do is try to make it
22:05
seem deeper I just don't know if they're always succeed right absolutely and don't let the Biden campaign listen to K
22:10
the rest of Kendrick labar's lyrics because he is not someone who is a huge fan of democratic and traditional
22:19
politics uh what's Up's next okay
22:32
the next name is Judge Canon uh Jess can you help us out here yeah absolutely so
22:38
judge Eileen Canon is the judge overseeing Trump's Florida trial related to the mar alogo documents um who can
22:47
forget those photos of the documents in the bathroom the classified documents that Federal investigators asked for
22:53
repeatedly and he would not give back and eventually were taken from his house uh a raid um so there have been a lot of
23:02
things that have happened in Trump's trials um where he just kind of seems to
23:09
get lucky break after lucky break and one of those lucky breaks was Judge
23:14
Canon being assigned to oversee this trial after she had previously made some
23:20
favorable rulings to Trump that really made you know kind of seasoned legal
23:26
observers raise their eybrows Trump appointed her to the federal bench she's relatively inexperienced uh for being a
23:35
federal judge and just about a week ago she issued a decision delaying the start
23:40
of his trial she had officially had a May 20th trial start date and she issued
23:46
this ruling that basically said there is just too much stuff to work through before we can start this trial so I'm
23:52
going to scrap the trial delay and not even set a new one because we just don't
23:58
know now this moment was a real victory for Trump because once again his lawyers
24:04
strategy to just delay and delay and delay his trials throw all kinds of
24:09
motions at the judges in the trials um has has worked yeah I mean I think back
24:17
so much to the episode that we did late last year uh called is Trump going to prison at that time it seemed like his
24:24
January 6th trial would be starting uh first and that that was the one in which
24:29
Trump lawyers least wanted to happen before the election and um and the one
24:34
they were least worried about was this New York case and we've seen it develop over these several months where the New
24:40
York case is the one that's taking place and while historic it does seem like a big victory for Trump that the things
24:48
that seemed most politically threatening via the case in Georgia this case in Florida with judge Cannon or the other
24:55
federal case on January 6 are now as you very unlikely to happen before November
25:01
a lot of polling tells us that some voters would say that Donald Trump was convicted of a crime before November
25:07
could change their feeling about them but we don't really have answers on if that depended on which trial went first
25:13
and so I think it's an open question about whether whatever happens in New York actually changes his political
25:19
future but what is unquestioned is the Donald Trump legal team and political
25:24
team wanted to delay these trials particularly till after he was the officially nominated Republican per the
25:31
RNC convention and to delay them after the November general election where they think that he can win and would be much
25:38
harder to prosecute and convict a sitting president and both of those delays are seeming to be things that
25:45
might come to fruition
25:57
right T Swift all right Taylor Swift the
26:02
princess of pop herself U we're talking about Taylor
26:09
Swift because this has come up in the last couple months as we remember around
26:14
the Super Bowl time there was an idea pushed by some Republicans that Taylor Swift was being intentionally kind of
26:21
blotting out all of Pop Culture because she was a liberal who had previously endorsed Biden and that they were said
26:28
her up to be one of the most impactful celebrity endorsers of the 2024 election
26:34
now there's an open question about the impact of celebrity endorsements in general but if anyone May matter in this
26:40
race it is likely to be the person whose every utterance seems to be news and uh
26:46
and seems to be at the center of American pop culture and um we were
26:51
thinking about this actually when we were at CPAC and talked to Jack poic who
26:56
was one of the Trump supporting com commentators who has famously popularized other conspiracies like
27:02
pizzagate and has dabbled in really kind of messy icky stuff but was one of the
27:09
people pushing this idea that Taylor Swift was a Democratic party uh plant
27:14
frankly and we asked him about it last question I have is like you've also blown up as like the Taylor Swift guy
27:20
too what how did this come up and do you really think Taylor Swift is part of a government conspiracy well I never said
27:26
she was part of government conspiracy other people have said things that may you know may have added on to what I said what I said was that a that the
27:34
Biden admin Biden campaign we should say and the Democrats would be very smart to
27:40
work towards getting an endorsement and actually I was talking about ballot harvesting uh using Taylor Swift as she
27:46
has in the past put out some of these calls for voter registration she endorsed Biden Harris in the past that
27:51
being said though because people have said whoa whoa are you attacking jaylor Swift I said no I'm not attacking Taylor Swift in fact I would love for Taylor
27:58
Swift to come to CAC the swifties can come as well fully open door if they want to get on board because they've
28:05
seen the policies of this Administration and they know that four years ago was better well I think in that we hear some
28:11
of the recognition of Taylor Swift's importance and per in kind of power in pop culture and a real uh understanding
28:18
that some of these people who have such platforms can drive big interest I remember when Taylor Swift tweeted out
28:25
that vote.org registration thing uh I remember Beyonce endorsing Betto right
28:30
before that uh Senate race in Texas and I think particularly in the Trump years
28:36
of 2016 to 20 there was a lot of pressure on pop stars and figures in culture to speak out more about politics
28:44
I one time interviewed LeBron James about his efforts with more than a vote to really push voter registration and
28:51
they were also doing a campaign to have people work as pole workers and that was actually fairly successful you saw like
28:57
battle ground States really have an influx of pow workers partially because of the attention that was placed on this
29:03
now while there's open kind of questions around how much celebrity endorsers move the literal needle in terms of votes I
29:10
do think they can be reflective of a larger cultural moment where people in
29:16
the spotlight Galvanize others to point their attention at politics and if we go
29:21
further I do think there was some in 2016 to 20 some galvanizing around anti-trump to say that this wasn't
29:29
America that this didn't represent larger values I wonder if celebrities
29:35
and people are going to be willing to step in it in the same way in 2024 you
29:41
know the winds around that stuff have changed a little the current Democratic president is pretty unpopular there's
29:47
pressure around whether you're going to speak out about things like uh International conflicts or even some
29:52
domestic issues and the same way that I think that anti-trump was a safe space
29:57
for a lot of celebrities to land in a more liberal Hollywood it's gotten a little more complicated than that and so
30:05
you know Taylor Swift can very well bake her Biden Harris 2020 cookies again four
30:10
years later and maybe that counts as the same level of endorsement but I bet you if she were to do that this time people
30:16
would have some more questions and I think that is a kind of thing that's happening particularly among celebrities
30:23
is there's been a what I feel is a retrenchment from social justice as part
30:28
of brand partially to avoid some of those questions what do you think Jess like do you think by the end of this we
30:34
get like you know Superstars for Biden or or even on the other side I think about the ways that Trump had you know
30:41
Lil Wayne Kodak Black a lot of like rap indorsers Kanye West famously like how
30:46
much do we think the Hollywood ecosystem is going to play in this presidential race I think that's such a good
30:54
observation and an important point like I think the reason that she is so you know sought after is
31:02
yes she is she is so famous but I think a big part of the reason that she is so sought after for the Biden campaign is
31:08
like this is a year where the same two guys are running against each other
31:13
voters know who Trump is they know what he's like they know who Biden is they know what he's like and it's starting to
31:19
need SP exactly he needs some spice but he also needs they I think this election
31:27
may turn Less on like convincing persuadable voters convincing swing
31:33
voters to come out for Biden or Trump than it is in persuading low propensity
31:39
voters people who have not voted before people who are feeling kind of apathetic about the election to to come out and
31:46
vote and I think that's where a figure like Taylor Swift could be seen as helpful Less in convincing people who
31:53
are considering Trump to go for Biden and more just in con Ving people who
31:59
weren't sure they were going to vote or weren't really thinking about it and kind of putting it on their radar and
32:04
getting them out one thing that Donald Trump is pissing quite explicitly in this campaign is a rejection of Elites
32:12
and one thing I would say I would be interested in about celebrity endorsers is if the tener in the air is to
32:20
intentionally provoke a class of people who has not been responsive there's a part of the Trump premise that's kind of
32:27
a immune to this because one he's kind of the biggest celebrity of all but two
32:34
I think what he's pitching is to say f you to that class of people and so if
32:41
that's the mood the electorate is in Taylor Swift will not overcome that yeah all right last but not
32:55
least cricket tell me who Cricket is cricket
33:04
was a 14mon old Wirehaired Pointer belonging
33:11
to Christine Nome who is now the governor of South Dakota who met her
33:16
untimely end in a gravel pit after a failed hunt um and we know about this
33:24
not because anybody asked Christino if she had ever shot her own dog in a
33:30
gravel pit um no we know about this because she told us she put it in her Memoir for all the world to see the
33:37
story of her euthanizing her own 14-month-old dog and a billy goat who is
33:44
unnamed for good measure wait so I've only tangentially followed the story why
33:49
did Christy gome kill her dog and why might it matter um she killed her dog cricket
33:57
because she had taken this dog in it had come to her from a different home where Cricut had had behavioral problems um
34:05
and gnome goes out with uh some visitors on this hunt with some of her kind of
34:12
more experienced dogs and the dog Cricket um and Cricket is just bad at
34:19
this I guess it is important if you are a hunting dog to like not run after the
34:24
birds too soon kind of not scare them up up out of the field Cricket wasn't built for the life of a hunter no no so
34:31
apparently cricet scared up all these birds before the hunters could get into range the day of hunting was ruined and
34:39
on her way back with with Crick she loaded a bunch of these dogs into the
34:44
back of her truck in kennels Cricut did not have a kennel so Cricut wasn't restrained she stops at her neighbor's
34:50
house Cricut jumps out and like kills all these chickens belonging to her
34:55
neighbor and then gnome decides that that this dog is untrainable cannot be
35:01
fixed and she takes cricet and her gun to a gravel pit and and kills her so the
35:08
governor of South Dakota kills her dog for being mildly annoying y um why like why does that matter for
35:17
November well Donald Trump once said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and
35:24
it wouldn't matter and it turns out that that privilege is not extended
35:30
necessarily to all the people that he is considering for vice president so gnome
35:37
is one of the figures who's been in the mix who's talked about as a possible Vice Presidential nominee for him um
35:44
she's a kind of combative governor of South Dakota she's very even combative
35:50
feels like a joke now yeah in this in this you know combative uh murderous to
35:56
dogs however you want to put it she's she's a Brash governor of South Dakota she's been very very loyal to Trump
36:02
she's always talked him up she's always kind of backed him to the hilt and this
36:08
story which just didn't seem to go away widely resonated and her likelihood
36:17
of being chosen for his vice presidential pick was not that high to begin with um but whatever chance she
36:25
has um from our reporting seems to have dimmed further yeah I mean she's been on
36:32
television trying to explain the dog away over the last couple weeks and then doing so has only dug the pit deeper um
36:41
I think dug the Gravel Pit rest in peace Cricket even deeper do we know who the
36:48
options of Vice President Trump is more likely to pick instead of Governor noome
36:53
yeah so when I think about the kind of options that Trump has in front of him
36:58
for vice president I'm thinking about like a few different categories there's a group of kind of political veterans uh
37:07
people who come with more experience people who come with their own constituencies somebody like Senator Tim
37:14
Scott of South Carolina he ran for president Trump and Scott kind of never
37:20
really locked horns during that primary they never really fought with each other
37:25
directly Scott was very careful to not make Trump mad he was he was very careful to not make Trump mad um some
37:32
other people who I think fall into that category of political veterans is someone like Senator Marco Rubio of
37:37
Florida who might be seen as like a little bit more of a palatable to
37:45
slightly more moderate voters figure on the ticket um whether there's an actual
37:51
swing voter who would be swayed by Marco Rubio's presence on the ticket I I I don't know but that kind of would be the
37:57
theory there um Elise stonic is another political veteran who really has hitched
38:02
her wagon to Trump has transformed from more of a republican moderate to someone
38:08
who just kind of blasts out his message at every turn um then you can think more
38:15
about kind of the second category that that that that I think of is like the the Trump loyalists someone like JD
38:22
Vance who initially in his career as a writer was pretty critical of trump and
38:27
has really just utterly transformed and made himself someone who defends Trump at every turn uh Sarah Sanders she is
38:35
now governor of Arkansas she was one of Trump's press secretaries during his presidency and so it was literally her
38:40
job to go out talk to the media about him talk about how great he was how loyal she was to him um and then there's
38:47
a group of kind of like younger upand cominging type figures and that's
38:53
someone like representative Byron Donald's of Florida um he's a second term Congressman he is
39:01
one of not a lot of black Republicans in the house um so he could bring some
39:08
racial diversity to the ticket at a time when Trump is trying to uh you know make inroads with black and Latino voters um
39:16
and then there's also someone like V ramaswami who who you know made a name for himself in the primary by being
39:25
Trump 2.0 in a way um never ever saying anything bad about
39:30
about former president Trump um so uh so yeah so thinking about the veterans the
39:35
Loyalists and the upand comers Next Generation interesting but not the dog
39:41
killers probably not the dog killers although I was talking to our colleague
39:47
Mike Bender last week and he said you know Trump loves a Redemption story he loves when people come to him and kind
39:53
of say I did something that was wrong I am still with you and so it ain't over till it's over but
40:00
it seems unlikely I did see um uh uh something on the VP search around the
40:06
idea that Trump would be considering Nikki Haley um that was immediately
40:11
squashed down by Trump what happened there so that was very interesting
40:17
because what n of the possibilities that I have just run through really do is
40:22
reach a constituency that Trump has a problem with and that is
40:27
moderate voters right like like going back to the kind of Larry Hogan esque
40:33
Republicans of the world there are not enough of them to run the party there are not enough of them to to have their
40:40
pick become the Presidential nominee but there's enough of them to snc his presidential campaign exactly exactly
40:47
and so were he to look at Niki Haley who said while she was running for president
40:54
that she was not running for vice president that she wasn't interested um were he to look at her he would be
40:59
finding a way potentially to bring along the in some cases 20 25 30% sometimes
41:07
even more of Republican voters in swing States who were backing her who didn't
41:13
like Trump who were uncomfortable with his candidacy but liked the way she kind of does throw back to a a pre-trump
41:20
tradition of Republicans so you can see how they can help each other solve some of their problems Trump provides her
41:27
sort of future while she provides him an outlet to voters who are currently uh lukewarm on him but
41:34
exactly but Trump said on Truth social she's not under consideration yes Trump said on Truth social she's not under
41:41
consideration there's a lot of bad blood there uh going back to Taylor Swift um
41:47
and and and he's they are never ever getting back together they are Never Ever Getting Back Together
41:54
exactly um Jess thank you so much I you know this was really helpful and I think
42:01

44:46
Dakota governor Doug beram and Ohio Senator JD Vance who denounced what he
44:52
described as partisanship from the prosecution the thing that the president is prevented from saying which is a
44:59
disgrace is that every single person involved in this prosecution is
45:04
practically a democratic political operative and three states held primaries on
45:09
Tuesday Nebraska West Virginia and Maryland where Angela also Brooks The
