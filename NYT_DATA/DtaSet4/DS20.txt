Everything You Need to Know About Super Tuesday


0:00
hey estad hey thank you for coming I
0:02
really appreciate this I'm pumped for it
0:05
yeah okay we're g to try to make super
0:07
Tuesday not feel so tepid
0:11
yes today is super Tuesday so people in
0:14
15 states and one territory are going to
0:17
the polls in Alabama Alaska Arkansas
0:22
California Colorado Maine Massachusetts
0:25
Minnesota North Carolina Oklahoma
0:28
Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia
0:31
and American
0:33
Samoa usually it's one of the biggest
0:36
days of the political
0:37
calendar but this year there's nothing
0:40
to indicate that it'll change the
0:42
broader picture of the presidential race
0:44
that Trump and Biden are seemingly
0:46
headed to a rematch it's a day when a
0:49
lot of people will make their voices
0:50
heard and there are also important down
0:53
ballot primaries happening and races
0:55
that could matter for control of the
0:56
house senate and governorships so I
1:00
called Amy Walter she's the publisher
1:02
and editor-in chief of the cook
1:04
political report which analyzes
1:06
elections and
1:08
campaigns and she's someone I trust to
1:10
help me understand what is worth paying
1:12
attention to this super
1:14
Tuesday you know I was thinking about it
1:17
today of all right what am I going to be
1:19
looking for in some of these states for
1:22
the presidential contest and and look
1:25
I'm going to be looking in particular in
1:28
some of these areas
1:30
where Nikki Haley has been doing better
1:34
which is Suburban areas around major
1:38
Metro areas or Suburban areas that have
1:41
been trending more democratic in the
1:45
last8 years or so so we know for example
1:48
in South Carolina where did she do best
1:50
she did best in and around Charleston
1:54
and Hilton Head where many of these
1:56
voters may still be voting for Donald
1:59
Trump but they would like a different
2:01
type of Republican the kind of
2:03
Republican they grew up with what she's
2:06
doing is highlighting the challenge
2:08
Trump has long had which is Suburban
2:12
white college educated voters especially
2:14
women are his real Achilles heel and he
2:18
has done nothing between 2020 and today
2:21
to win them back but that doesn't mean
2:25
that he's going to lose more of them
2:28
than he did in 2020 that to me is the
2:30
big question it's not so much is he
2:32
going to lose these many of these voters
2:34
of course but is it going to be worse
2:37
than where he
2:38
was four years ago and that's the real
2:42
issue ofstead is that the primaries
2:44
can't really tell us that we're only
2:46
going to know as we get you know deeper
2:49
into the election year and see if there
2:53
are indeed Nikki Haley voters who were
2:56
two-time Trump voters who say today you
2:59
know know what I just can't go a third
3:02
round what about on the Democratic side
3:04
when you look at the landscape of either
3:06
the early primaries that we've seen or
3:08
the polling numbers that we've seen I'm
3:10
curious of what your kind of temperature
3:13
check is on just how much trouble Biden
3:16
is in or is some of this a freak out
3:19
with lack of evidence right there's
3:22
definitely a reason to be worried or
3:26
freaked out whatever the term is if
3:27
you're in the Biden Camp because it's
3:30
pretty clear that there is a significant
3:32
group of Voters who are not yet sold on
3:35
Donald Trump but who really aren't into
3:38
Joe Biden either these may be voters who
3:40
voted against Trump in the last two
3:43
elections or maybe they're voters that
3:46
haven't been particularly involved in
3:48
politics yet maybe they were too young
3:49
to vote in 2020 for example but they
3:52
just are not even though they may not as
3:55
I said vote for Trump they're not voting
3:57
for Biden but the other piece too is
4:00
that you know one of uh the things that
4:03
Biden had going for him in 2020 was this
4:07
idea that for voters who identify
4:10
themselves as Independents or maybe more
4:13
moderate Centrist types that he was
4:16
going to be the better candidate for
4:19
them and now those voters I mean again
4:23
if you look at the polling which I think
4:25
right now is too much too early but he's
4:28
not doing particularly well with
4:29
independent voters Trump is doing much
4:31
much better there's clearly been erosion
4:34
with voters of color both Latino voters
4:37
and black voters and so how real is that
4:41
how significant is that yeah as I said
4:44
again we can't know from these primaries
4:47
alone because I think so much of the
4:50
erosion is among the kinds of Voters who
4:53
are not particularly engaged in politics
4:57
certainly not this far out yeah that's a
4:59
great point I mean we hear this
5:00
consistently I remember when we talked
5:01
to Nate con he made this point that the
5:04
people that the evidence is pointing to
5:06
that Biden is having the most trouble
5:07
with or could be the potential
5:08
vulnerabilities for November are simply
5:10
a different group of people then who are
5:12
deeply involved in primaries
5:14
particularly this primary which seems
5:16
even like less engaged than previous
5:19
ones we're simply talking about a
5:21
different slice of the pie that's right
5:23
I guess with that landscape we really
5:25
wanted to have you help us kind of
5:28
understand the n on top of the ticket uh
5:31
races and specifically look at some of
5:33
the races that are happening on super
5:35
Tuesday can you give me a big picture on
5:37
how things are shaping up when it comes
5:39
to the race for House and Senate control
5:42
sure uh we can start with the Senate
5:45
because that's one where the math and
5:48
the map really work against the
5:50
Democrats if you look at the just a
5:53
number of seats that are up Democrats
5:55
have to defend 23 seats Republicans just
5:58
10 but it's more than that it's the
6:01
kinds of seats they have to defend so
6:03
three of the seats of those 23 are
6:07
states that Trump carried in 2020 so
6:10
West Virginia Ohio Montana obviously in
6:14
West Virginia Joe Mansion has announced
6:16
that he's retiring right that is a seat
6:19
that Republicans are almost guaranteed
6:21
to win right that scene is an automatic
6:23
clip that's right that's right so in a
6:26
state that Trump carried by like 40
6:28
points yeah I think that's a pretty um
6:30
easy thing to say but that also means
6:33
that we should think about this election
6:36
going into 2024 that the Senate is
6:39
50/50 and in that scenario it means that
6:42
if Trump wins the Senate is already
6:46
Republican the only way the Senate stays
6:48
Democratic is if Biden wins and they
6:51
don't lose anything they don't lose
6:53
Montana Ohio Arizona Nevada Pennsylvania
6:57
Wisconsin all of those States they have
6:59
to defend now they can I'm not saying
7:01
they're going to lose all of those but
7:03
to say you've got to win every single
7:05
one you can't afford to lose any of
7:07
those that is a very very difficult
7:09
thing Democrats need to sweep both all
7:12
of the competitive races and win the
7:14
white house because the receipt they're
7:15
almost guaranteed to lose in West
7:17
Virginia means we're almost inevitably
7:19
looking at a 50-50 Senate in the best
7:21
case scenario for Democrat correct okay
7:23
yeah so that's the Senate and on super
7:26
Tuesday we're going to have an answer in
7:28
a state that's not exactly on that
7:31
competitive list and that's
7:32
California this is primary that is
7:35
really about the question of which kind
7:38
of democrat is going to come to
7:40
Washington not so much will Republicans
7:42
flip this state right that we're not
7:44
getting many of the answers to the D
7:47
versus R in the primary season right now
7:49
but there are some states that are
7:50
having kind of in competitive battles
7:52
one being California one being
7:54
California where the big question right
7:57
now is Will the top two candidates
8:01
because this is how California's primary
8:03
works the two top vote Getters go on to
8:06
face each other in November will those
8:09
top two vote Getters be two Democrats or
8:12
will it be a Democrat and a republican
8:14
two leading candidates for Senate two
8:16
very different Visions for California
8:19
Steve Garvey the leading Republican is
8:21
too conservative for California he voted
8:23
for Trump twice and supported
8:26
Republicans for years including
8:27
far-right conservatives Adam Schiff the
8:30
leading Democrat defended democracy
8:32
against Trump and the insurrectionists
8:34
he helped right now I think everybody
8:36
agrees and the polls say the same that
8:39
Adam Schiff congressman from the Los
8:41
Angeles area is the front runner here
8:43
and is pretty much guaranteed a spot in
8:45
the runoff the question is whether a
8:48
republican Steve Garvey former for those
8:50
of us who grew up in the 70s and 80s
8:53
remember him as the Los Angeles Dodgers
8:57
star baseball player I've decided to get
9:00
off the bench to suit up again and get
9:03
back in the game and now for me the
9:05
ultimate Challenge to change your life
9:08
for the better by being a US senator go
9:10
to Steve Garvey doc you did not then no
9:13
you probably don't know who he is but as
9:16
a child of the 80s I do remember him or
9:20
he will face shift that is Will face
9:22
Katie Porter from Orange County who
9:25
comes from the Elizabeth warwing of the
9:28
party Washington the US Senate drowning
9:31
in Wall Street money and big Pharma
9:33
lobbyists Katie Porter says enough time
9:36
to shake the Senate up shiff of course
9:39
made his name with the impeachment
9:41
proceedings the very first impeachment
9:43
of Donald Trump and that helped him you
9:46
know in a state that is really expensive
9:48
and really hard to get known that got
9:50
him a lot of Name ID and also helped him
9:52
raise a ton of money yeah yeah what
9:55
about the house how was the race shaping
9:58
up when it comes to control of the house
10:01
in November that thing is just an
10:03
absolute toss up I think the easiest way
10:05
to think about it is Republicans have a
10:07
five- seat majority and there are about
10:10
25 seats that we consider to be the most
10:14
competitive pretty evenly divided
10:16
between the two uh parties and so for
10:21
Democrats to win they need to win
10:24
something like 65 70ish per of the
10:27
closest races
10:29
in order to just narrowly take control
10:32
of the house that's possible but again
10:36
it's not like oh well they only need
10:38
five seats how hard can that be just get
10:41
five right we've seen so much of like
10:42
talk about the Republicans SL majority
10:44
the amount of retirements but you know
10:46
and even Democrats feeling good at their
10:48
prospects of the house but I hear you
10:50
saying like they still need to have a
10:52
good election night to even get this
10:54
narrowest of margins exactly they really
10:56
do because yes they have have a lot of
10:59
targets namely Republicans who sit in
11:04
districts that Biden carried but they've
11:06
got their own vulnerable incumbents some
11:09
of whom sit in districts that Trump
11:11
carried in 2020 and then redistricting
11:14
in North Carolina which basically Drew
11:17
three Democrats out of their seats so
11:20
the house is really a battle of inches
11:22
more than anything else it feels like
11:24
we're playing a football game that is
11:26
literally just between the end zone and
11:28
the 5year line it's literally who can
11:30
grind their way to those few seats that
11:34
they need to be in the majority and you
11:37
know likely not a very big majority at
11:40
that you know one thing that really
11:42
comes through in our reporting is that
11:44
people really don't like their options
11:45
at the top of the ticket if that's some
11:47
one big thing we hear whether on the
11:48
road or from listeners it's like why do
11:50
we have these options and like that it
11:53
bums them out about the prospect of uh
11:57
voting in November when we think about
11:59
turnout for this year or when we think
12:02
about people's level of Engagement or
12:04
investment in the race is there any
12:06
signs about like whether this was going
12:09
to be like a robustly participating
12:11
election because in some ways I feel
12:12
like people are checked out but I also
12:13
think that you know we had big
12:15
engagement in 2022 and we have big
12:16
engagement in 2020 right how should I
12:19
weigh those things gosh I I'm with you
12:21
on that instead I I'm very torn about
12:24
that because you're right on the one
12:25
hand if you just look at the data that
12:28
says people are really dispirited with
12:30
their choices they are so disappointed
12:33
in a Congress that it looks more and
12:35
more dysfunctional every day they are
12:38
tuning out of the news we're seeing more
12:40
and more evidence of this and so this
12:43
idea of like I don't want to participate
12:46
but I don't know that that is really
12:48
what's going on and certainly by the
12:49
time we get to November because I think
12:52
much like
12:53
20120 the stakes of the election for
12:57
both sides are going to be very very
12:58
clear and be um broadcast over and over
13:02
again that there are not subtle
13:05
differences between these candidates
13:07
there are pretty significant differences
13:09
between Joe Biden and Donald Trump and
13:12
what their agenda will be for the next
13:17
four years so it seems to me that those
13:20
things are going to be critically
13:22
important I mean remember that um you
13:25
know at this time in 2022 it was like
13:28
man Democrats are going to get crushed
13:30
in the midterms they have no enthusiasm
13:33
right no one wants to turn out people
13:35
are checked out the economy is bad etc
13:38
etc and then of course the dobs decision
13:41
comes out and that changes everything
13:42
but even then we couldn't really measure
13:46
how
13:47
important that issue of abortion was in
13:51
the sense that you still in the polls
13:53
you would see people responding that yes
13:56
the issue of abortion rights is
13:58
important but I'm really concerned about
14:00
the economy or yeah I'm concerned about
14:04
abortion rights but I also think Biden's
14:06
doing a terrible job and so I think
14:08
those crosscurrents are going to still
14:12
they're going to be there and maybe we
14:15
are living in a moment where voters are
14:17
going to have to sort of adjust their
14:21
expectations yeah in terms of each of
14:24
these elections is incredibly
14:26
consequential even if the candidates
14:29
themselves are not appealing yeah I
14:31
think you really helped us understand
14:33
that phenomenon in 2022 you made a kind
14:36
of specific reference to the type of
14:38
Voters who I remember you calling meev
14:40
voters right like I remember the
14:42
explanation that some people can uh
14:44
Express displeasure with the president
14:45
or Express displeasure with the party
14:47
and still actually come out it's like
14:49
hard for me to think that if we actually
14:51
have an election where whether Donald
14:53
Trump goes to jail or not is like
14:56
basically up to whether he's president
14:58
that people are gonna not care about
15:00
that like it's like hard for me to
15:02
actually I agree completely I've I've
15:05
taken to using the Green Day song of
15:09
Wake Me Up When September Ends as my
15:11
motto for this year but I do think
15:13
that's where a lot of Voters are like
15:15
I'll check back in tell me when it's
15:17
October and I'll check in you know
15:20
outside of the candidates who were you
15:22
know as we're talking about a lot of
15:23
people don't find all that inspiring
15:26
what are the themes or policies or
15:28
issues that you think are going to be
15:31
what the elections about is there any
15:33
hints if you look at the super Tuesday
15:34
landscape or even some of the races that
15:36
we've seen so far about what are some of
15:38
the defining themes that could really be
15:41
where November is one or lost on yeah I
15:45
think unfortunately the primaries don't
15:47
give us a great insight into that what I
15:50
do think they tell us a lot about though
15:52
is especially on the Republican side
15:54
where so many of these primaries are
15:56
happening in States like North Carolina
15:59
where they redrew the map and so we have
16:02
a number of open very Republican
16:05
districts that will get a new member and
16:08
um so you're seeing it there and in some
16:10
of these other states that have
16:11
primaries the top issue which shouldn't
16:14
be surprising to anybody who follows
16:16
politics is uh immigration I'm running
16:19
for congress because with Joe Biden's
16:21
open border the criminals walk right in
16:24
I think every single ad that I've
16:26
watched and every one of these races
16:29
menance immigration yeah Joe Biden and
16:32
Democrats have turned our border over to
16:34
cartels and the woke leftwing mop
16:36
America is crumbling and being invaded
16:38
under Joe Biden Joe Biden broke our
16:40
border our economy our spirits and I
16:43
will fight for a secure border and then
16:47
the next most popular term is Trump Bo
16:51
hindes and president Trump will get us
16:53
back on track Trump and buck out
16:56
together they'll beat sleepy Joe I'm
16:58
standing ending with Addison McDow the
17:00
only candidate in the race that's
17:02
endorsed by Donald Trump vote Sandy
17:04
Smith and president Trump by March 5th
17:06
to save America fighting Must Be Stopped
17:09
I'm C Smith Trump has an issue Trump has
17:11
an issue and Trump as an endorser and
17:14
Trump as I will stand with him or my
17:17
opponent hasn't been as supportive of
17:21
Donald Trump you know thinking back to
17:24
2017 and what the Congress looked like
17:28
the Republican Congress looked like then
17:31
and what Donald Trump was sort of up
17:34
against in terms of the quote unquote
17:36
now we think of it as the old guard of
17:38
the Republican party but the more the
17:40
pre- trumpian Republican party just in
17:44
the last six years that party has been
17:47
completely transformed and when I look
17:50
at these primaries and the people who
17:52
again they'll win these primaries
17:54
they're coming to Washington in November
17:55
because their districts are so
17:57
Republican they won't have a serious
18:00
challenge in November they're going to
18:03
look a lot more like Donald Trump and if
18:06
he wins reelection it means that the
18:09
Congress there are very few speed bumps
18:13
in the way that there were for him in
18:15
2017 so that makes for you know a
18:18
Congress that is going to be much easier
18:22
for Donald Trump to get anything not
18:24
anything through but he will have an
18:26
easier time let's put it that way or
18:28
harder for a Joe Biden than the second
18:30
ter well that's another great way to
18:31
think about it exactly which is the
18:33
folks who are coming in right now are
18:35
not running on you know it would be so
18:36
great as if we did some more
18:39
compromising let's let's work with the
18:41
other side more yeah yeah so let's look
18:43
at some super Tuesday specific races you
18:45
know there's been some that we looked at
18:47
you mentioned North Carolina the first
18:49
district there there's a couple in
18:50
California California 22 California 47
18:53
some of those places where the house
18:55
races might be one or lost there's some
18:56
important Governor's races I'm thinking
18:58
about North Carolina again which has
19:01
going to be what's a closely watched one
19:02
if you look at something that's you know
19:04
going down literally today as or as
19:07
folks are listening to this what would
19:08
be a race that you point to and say
19:11
that's why to have my eye on yeah I am
19:14
looking at the North Carolina District
19:17
it's the first district this is a
19:20
democratic held District but it is very
19:23
swingy and was made even a little bit
19:26
tougher in redistricting the candidate
19:29
that comes out of that primary is going
19:31
to matter a lot on the Republican side
19:33
the two-time losing candidate or last
19:36
name Smith um if she wins there that
19:40
probably makes again it doesn't take it
19:42
off the table but it may give the
19:45
Democrat there the Cong Democratic
19:47
Congressman there a better opportunity
19:49
to hold on than if he gets a new
19:51
Challenger who is not quite as burdened
19:55
let's say with uh a lot of political
19:57
problem like former candidate so in
20:00
other words if we're talking about the
20:01
house as being a battle of inches then
20:05
this is one of those inches there right
20:08
um I also like it aead of this is my
20:10
East Coast bias showing because I don't
20:13
have to stay up late and then you have
20:15
the you pointed out the governor's race
20:17
which is also really interesting you
20:20
know North Carolina's is sort of like
20:22
the Charlie and the football for
20:25
Democrats they come so close at the
20:27
federal level and yet never seemed to
20:31
score that goal or that field goal or
20:34
whatever but Georgia used to be for them
20:36
yeah exactly exactly and you know the
20:41
opportunity here for Republicans to pick
20:44
up the governor's seat is pretty high
20:46
you know you've had a Democratic
20:47
governor for two terms again you've got
20:50
the legislature that is super majority
20:53
Republican you've got two Republican
20:55
Senators right now the polling suggests
20:57
that while it's competitive Trump's he's
21:01
I saw a poll recently he was right
21:02
around
21:03
50% and yet Republicans are likely to
21:07
nominate a candidate very very far to
21:11
the right who will fit into that same
21:14
category that we saw in 2022 with Carrie
21:17
Lake from Arizona and the candidate in
21:21
Pennsylvania who was very much to the
21:24
right on social issues cultural issues
21:27
and that's where this candidate Mark
21:29
Robinson is on everything
21:33
from abortion to gay rights to the
21:37
Holocaust I mean it's pretty dramatic
21:40
there's no reason anybody anywhere in
21:43
America should be telling any child
21:47
about transgenderism homosexuality any
21:50
of that filth and yes I called it filth
21:53
and if you don't like it that I called
21:54
it filth come see me and I'll explain it
21:56
to you this isn't just oh this is a
21:59
trump like candidate God formed me cuz
22:02
he knew there was going to be a time
22:05
when God's Learning was going to be
22:07
intolerable to the wicked when children
22:10
were going to be dragged down to go see
22:12
the drag show you know this has been the
22:15
challenge in the era of trump right
22:17
which is State parties or primary voters
22:22
who want to see candidates who aren't
22:26
you know necessarily built for a swing
22:28
state they want a candidate that's built
22:31
for a red state who's going to be a
22:34
fighter for values of you know cultural
22:37
and otherwise conservative or Trump
22:39
conservative voters but that's not the
22:43
state yeah I mean the candidate you're
22:45
referring to Mark Robinson is a good
22:48
example of this type of phenomenon in
22:50
the Trump era as we had in 20122 there
22:52
are candidates who have kind of
22:55
fashioned themselves as the tell it like
22:58
it is straight shooter grievance driven
23:01
Politically Incorrect style Maga
23:04
candidates and this guy's really at the
23:05
top of the list he has caught the
23:07
Holocaust hogwash in a Facebook post he
23:10
has you know been completely out of Step
23:13
even on issues like abortion and denying
23:15
the last election I mean when you look
23:19
at the landscape of Republican
23:21
candidates is it feeling as I don't have
23:24
a better word as trumpy as the 2022
23:28
slate was I mean that famously failed
23:31
right like you would think that in a
23:33
competitive race like a North Carolina
23:35
governor race like we would not be back
23:38
here with the same type of candidate
23:40
exactly that you would say I don't know
23:42
I I kind of feel like we've seen this
23:44
movie before but it seems to me that
23:47
that is not really if the priority is
23:51
the
23:52
fight then winning isn't
23:56
necessarily what you're always aiming
23:59
for yeah that's really that's
24:01
really the fight is what you want and
24:05
the fight is for something bigger and
24:07
more I guess existential than just did
24:10
we win this last election and this I
24:14
think it it also speaks to this idea
24:17
that the bubble fication maybe of our
24:20
parties right that each of them are
24:22
speaking only to the groups that they
24:24
are most closely aligned with Asos to
24:28
understanding that in a state that is
24:30
purple you got to be able to win over
24:35
independent voters you can't just get
24:37
your base it is fascinating though
24:40
instead because just as we discussed how
24:42
close the race for the house will be we
24:44
pretty sure that the presidential race
24:47
also going to come down to just like
24:49
right few thousand votes here and there
24:51
if you're always just a few thousand
24:53
votes from
24:54
winning then it makes it really hard for
24:58
you to take a good honest look in the
25:00
mirror and say maybe we should change
25:03
right the way we do things right when
25:04
the polarization is such where if it's
25:07
4951 every time right like it's hard to
25:11
get that ship to change courses in
25:13
Direction because you say well next year
25:15
it can be the other way around we can
25:16
get 50 and you know the times when the
25:19
parties have really sort of gotten
25:23
themselves back on track is when they
25:24
got walloped right like losing election
25:27
after election and not just by like a
25:29
point or two but like oh hey look at
25:32
Democrats throughout the 80s and the
25:34
presidential elections there where
25:36
they're just getting wiped out that's
25:39
when you say okay what we're doing isn't
25:42
working but if we still live in an era
25:44
where you're just constantly going back
25:46
and forth about who has the White House
25:47
and who has the house and maybe the
25:49
Senate is up for grabs here and there
25:51
well it doesn't give you much incentive
25:54
to change M you know when people wake up
25:57
on when Wednesday morning what should
25:59
they be looking for what what should be
26:01
the first place they look to on the map
26:03
hm that's a very good question I think
26:05
what we will be curious to see is at the
26:08
presidential level did Donald Trump put
26:11
numbers on the map even in States and in
26:14
places where a Nikki Haley in on paper
26:17
would do well to me what that suggests
26:20
is that whatever energy there is or was
26:24
for a Nikki Haley to keep up this fight
26:28
that that has pretty much gone away so
26:32
I'll be curious to see that because you
26:35
know we have places like Massachusetts
26:36
and Vermont um and Virginia so I'm here
26:40
in Northern Virginia I am very curious
26:43
to see what turnout looks like here this
26:45
is a state that notably has been
26:49
shifting more and more from even purple
26:52
to Blue but what if Trump is doing
26:56
really really well here to me that
26:59
suggests that as I said that whatever
27:01
energy there was behind sort of sending
27:03
a message to Trump or supporting Nikki
27:06
Haley has gone and then as I said I I
27:09
would like to think we'll have an answer
27:10
in California for the senate race I
27:13
don't know that we will and in these
27:16
house races in these primaries the kinds
27:20
of candidates that came out is going to
27:22
tell us a story
27:25
of were any of the C candidates who did
27:29
not style themselves in the House
27:32
Freedom caucus mold or who were say
27:38
backed by more quote unquote
27:40
establishment types make it
27:44
