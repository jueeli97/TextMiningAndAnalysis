Inside the College Democratsâ€™ Rebuke of Biden


0:05
so here's what we know when it comes to the anti-war protests on college campuses and electoral politics
0:12
President Biden has a problem with young activists and the disapproval particularly from the left has only
0:18
intensified in the days after the president spoke critically about the protest but whether or not he has a
0:25
problem with the young electorate at large remains to be seen which is why one response from a more mainstream
0:32
organization really caught my attention the college Democrats of America who
0:38
said last week the White House was on a quote mistaken route unquote that could
0:43
make it harder to win young voters the statement turn heads in political circles because the college
0:50
Democrats are closely aligned with National Party leadership leaders of the group are
0:55
delegates to the Democratic Convention and it's pretty rare to see them say anything bad about a Democratic
1:02
president and as I soon learned the statement also divided the group's
1:08
leadership so over the past few days we reached out to a bunch of the group's
1:13
members including members of the executive board the head of its Muslim caucus and the chair of its Jewish
1:19
caucus to get the inside story of what happened and why today how the college Democrats of
1:27
America came to break with the Democratic president and what it could mean for the
1:33
fall from the New York Times I'm a stead hearnen this is the [Music]
1:43
runup hey how are you good how are you said good good thanks for chatting with
1:49
us yes no thank you for having me on how you have have you been so far uh I'm doing okay my Friday is kind of just uh
1:55
largely starting uh how about yours uh I'm trying to finish up my senior thesis which is like 30 pages oh what's it
2:02
about tell me uh it's about populism actually I'm doing a comparative study on populism in Brazil and turkey hust
2:10
pelli is a senior at Wake Forest University in North Carolina he's also the chair of the college Democrats
2:16
Muslim caucus and he help craft the statement that the college Democrats put out last week growing up you know I
2:24
really wasn't into politics that much not because you know I didn't find it interesting of course I did I just never
2:29
thought there was a place in there for me you know uh you can ask some of my friends in middle school and high school
2:34
I always talked about being a prime minister of Pakistan because I you that's where my family's from because I
2:41
never thought I had a future in politics here why did you feel that I guess because there was no Role Models out
2:46
there for me you know Obama had been elected during you know when I was a little kid and I saw the the backlash
2:52
that he had gotten as the first black president and people were saying this will never happen again where things
2:59
changed for me on that score was 2018 and then I saw people like ilhan Omar
3:04
and Rashida TB people who proudly wore their Muslim identities and told the world who they were and they got elected
3:11
for that so seeing them win was just so so heartening and it it made me feel
3:17
like I had a chance to because growing up post 2001 post 911 that generation
3:25
that I was part of only the only thing I saw was the rejection of Islam the
3:30
rejection of Muslims and so that was really inspirational to me eventually
3:36
hass's interest in politics led him to volunteer for Bernie Sanders and his bid
3:41
for the 2020 Democratic nomination let me tell you I was spending all my free time and my friends can tell you in high
3:47
school I was spending all my free time knocking doors uh you know calling people saying got to vote for Bernie
3:53
like come on you got to do this I would posting on my Instagram posting on Snapchat uh and just it's so funny cuz I
3:59
would consider myself a fairly political high schooler and the idea of me spending my free time knocking on doors
4:05
for political candidate is wild yeah no literally I would go to like farmers markets and be like hi would you like to
4:12
phone and I would be the only one there uh passing out flyers and I'll just talk to you know me being a high schooler uh
4:19
so you know that that was how I spent my free time uh seeing that not work out though was was a little bit of a hit to
4:25
me I was like dang seeing the Bernie campaign not work out yeah yeah because you you know it represented everything
4:31
we wanted in terms of Economic Policy social policy the the change was real the energy was there like we we just
4:39
about had it and then for that not to have worked out was a little bit of a blow to me personally but when Joe Biden
4:45
ultimately became the Democrats nominee Hass was impressed with his Outreach to young voters and got on board he adopted
4:52
$15 an hour he was talking about canceling $10,000 in student debt which isn't everything but it's still a lot he
4:58
talked about bringing a you know revolution in terms of public transportation and I was like wait there
5:04
there is some good here there is some things I can lat on to so it was actually purely policy driven my willingness to work on his campaign so
5:11
Biden goes and wins in 2020 and in the first couple years I'm curious how you felt about the administration and also
5:18
how your involvement in college Democrats developed in terms of Biden in the first couple years I was elated like
5:24
I was on you know I was like ra Biden like I love him because he did the child tax cred the American Rescue plan the
5:31
checks they weren't quite $2,000 but they were pretty good right you know opening uh things back up in a in a
5:37
pretty efficient manner I think and the biggest thing for me was the withdrawal from the Afghanistan war because I had
5:43
seen so much Devastation for so many years and being anti-war was also one of
5:48
those things that a lot of people in my community a lot of Muslims were anti-war but that was a very non-popular View and
5:55
that was a big deal so seeing seeing that happen I was you know on the moon I was like wow he's he's really he's
6:02
really delivering I think at least in the first couple years I was very happy how did you come to be the Muslim caucus
6:08
chair yeah it was the beginning of my senior year and um you know before that I hadn't really seen too much Outreach
6:15
on the behalf of the democratic party towards Muslim Americans I don't think besides the occasional like happy
6:20
Ramadan and and things like that so I was like yeah there's a lot of work here to be done sounds like actually a really cool position and then this this year
6:27
has been my tenure of being Muslim caucus champ and what a year I mean I am
6:32
partially I mean this is what we're here to talk about is like the ways like CH seed has kind of put you in the center
6:39
of some big developments with college Democrats I guess I wanted to start um kind of on October 7th or around that
6:46
time you know that's when obviously hamasa launched their attack in Israel uh uh you know killing 1,200 people
6:51
according to officials there uh I mean what did you think when you saw the events unfolded what was the immediate conversation among the college Democrats
6:59
of America right so I think first of all just to start off with yeah you're right that
7:04
chairmanship was supposed to be like vote on things when votes are brought up and you know advocate for the happy
7:10
Ramadan post that's all right it turned out to be a lot more so on October 7th when that all went down it was like okay
7:17
we need to appoint people on this we need to have a stance on this and my feelings on that day were you know I
7:23
couldn't see a good way out but also this is not a new issue the problem
7:29
didn't start on October 7th I remember you know going to the mosque I think I was 10 years old and halfway through the
7:35
prayer the Imam who was supposed to keep a solemn tone just read the verses and then move on he broke down halfway
7:42
through and and started crying and this never happens like I've never seen it in my and after that too I've never seen it
7:47
in my life and and he started crying about Gaza and so on October 7th I was
7:53
like this has been happening for so long did you say that I did I did and I not
7:59
only that I I wrote a piece in the uh old golden black about it uh talking about how this is not a new thing this
8:05
has been going on since I was a kid that's the campus newspaper and um yes and wake for yeah yeah that's our that's our campus newspaper and I wrote a piece
8:11
saying I I I so sympathize with your pain because you're so devastated and
8:18
I've been devastated too like we have to come together now and stand with each other in our pain so when we had a uh a
8:24
vigil here for the for the Jewish lives lost I went there with my Jewish friends and and stood with them and I'm so glad
8:30
to say that when we had our Muslim vigil when the retaliation started and I think
8:35
at the time 5,000 8,000 people were killed uh a lot of my Jewish friends came and stood with me at that Muslim
8:42
vigil so I knew I had a heighten role I personally put out a lot of statements uh in terms of me and my personal
8:48
capacity right both on Instagram uh in the old golden black and I was trying to keep things tame on our campus and I I I
8:56
talked about it a lot with people in college Democrats and the the culmination of my role really came around uh November and December where I
9:03
was like okay I've been in these conversations something needs to be said right like we need to we need to take a
9:09
position and call for a ceasefire how were you received very well actually everyone who I talked to was like I've
9:15
been looking for someone to do this and I haven't done it yet but I'm so glad that you did because like it takes a lot
9:21
of courage to do this and nearly everyone I talked to put their name as co-sponsors then I got to talk to the
9:28
Jewish cockus share uh who was kind of the last person who I hadn't spoken with and talked to her for the first time Allison very nice person
9:36
and we got working together and she also co-signed that ceasefire resolution um
9:41
and when we put it up for a vote it got unanimous consent and if I read the resolution it says the college Democrats
9:46
of America spearheaded by the Muslim and caucus and Jewish caucus unanimously call for a ceasefire in the Middle East
9:52
and denounce the rise of anti-Semitism and islamophobia on college campuses across the country and I see a lot of
9:58
the main chairs here of the college Democrats America signed it and you said the resolution was passed unanimously
10:04
that's right now question I have though is you know uh Rashida T ban Omar kind
10:10
of politicians you have mentioned here were calling for the Biden Administration to kind of do that also around this time and you weren't really
10:16
seeing that get big traction uh among kind of national why did you all um feel
10:23
that you had to go ahead of where you know the main Democrats are so in December it was actually a very rare and
10:30
tough position to take which is why I was so hesitant for so long but I just felt like a moral compulsion that I had
10:36
to at least try and if I tried and failed that would be okay but at least I tried and I thought our position as a
10:43
part of the DNC gave us a platform that no one really else had right of course
10:48
Ilan Omar rashita to were calling from them kind of from the outside but it would be huge for the party itself to
10:53
rebuke the president and say uh you know we are calling for a ceasefire and that's what we the youngest members of
10:59
MERS of the DNC to call it I do think it'si I mean one question I have for you
11:05
is around that time there was an explosion of kind of Youth activism uh
11:10
uh people interrupting the President and Vice President particularly at their public events we spoke to some protesters who interrupted um President
11:17
Biden at um mother Emanuel in in uh South Carolina church yeah in the church
11:23
some of those actions were controversial what did you think of those tactics that others were using to push the administration from the outside I
11:29
thought they were amazing I have so much respect for those activists who interrupted him at the church and everywhere else because I think when
11:36
politicians take a cont not even controversial when they take a morally wrong stance they shouldn't be given any
11:41
peace everywhere they go they should be yelled at and I I got to do some of my own yelling uh you know to to
11:47
politicians here at Wake Forest they had invited uh President Bush to come on and when Bush came and he started talking
11:54
about how the Iraq War was justified I don't know what came over me but I got up in my seat and just started started yelling at him you liar you lied to the
12:01
American people you're lying now I'm kind of curious as to your Embrace of
12:07
these tactics considering like you know you're someone who exists both in an Insider and Outsider space you know I
12:14
think about your work with uh Biden campaign while at the same time saying you know that you believe that
12:20
politicians who take stances that are deemed morally reprehensible should face no peace I mean do you see any tension
12:28
in the worlds that you exist in oh there's so much yeah yeah I guess I'm saying how do you uh untangle that you
12:36
know you know it it's tough to be in the space because I think it takes both I think it takes people on the inside pushing the envelope and and calling for
12:44
change internally right I think uh when that message comes from someone like me
12:50
who has worked on the Biden campaign who has worked in local Congressional races I think it has a little bit more meaning
12:55
to it because I've done the work and I've been there and also I think they need to feel the public pressure too if
13:01
it's just me saying it with no public pressure kind of Falls flat because they don't feel a need to listen mhm well
13:06
let's talk about the last couple weeks cuz you know those have really um kind of exploded this issue even further
13:11
particularly the liberated zones or encampments that we have seen across college campuses uh and in places like
13:17
Columbia University where University presidents called in the police after students forcefully took over a building
13:23
I mean when you see actions like that is there any uncomfort with uh students
13:29
taking over a building some folks where we've seen individual instances of anti-Semitism how do you separate the
13:36
larger agreement with the moral cause with an alignment with some protesters that have become increasingly
13:42
controversial within the Democratic party that's right I think I think there's a parsing that we can do that's pretty easy for me to do personally
13:49
right I can say at the same time yes there's Bad actors here and that you're going to have that in any movement but I
13:54
think as long as the majority of people are doing the right thing and standing there in a morally just cause I think
14:01
that's something that we should stand with and I don't think it's worth condemning an entire movement which is what we've
14:07
seen I was going to ask about what you thought about the White House's response to the encampments what were you hoping
14:13
that the president said versus what he actually did say yeah I was hoping he would say I hear you I stand with you
14:19
it's time to change and call for a ceasefire I hope he would see that there's a wide swath of people all
14:25
across the country you know crying out this what we're doing is morally wrong and it needs to change but also
14:30
politically if I saw my own voters coming out there and protesting I would I would change course and that's what I
14:37
was hoping for what I saw was a condemnation of of all the protesters as anti-semitic and you know no support for
14:44
them G they were given the cold shoulder in both his press conference yesterday and his statement that he released
14:50
beforehand and that was just it was saddening it was shameful and I think it
14:55
was just disgraceful the way he went about it the last thing I want to say say and I want to get to the actual statement you all put out in the last
15:01
couple days is about Biden's response you said that you felt that he was just painting everyone with a full brush of
15:07
anti-Semitism or things but he also did affirm the larger right to protest you know he's talked about his own
15:13
involvement in movements previously but he tried to make a distinction between what he felt was happening in these
15:19
versus uh more peaceful protest why isn't that the right tone for a
15:25
president to strike in your opinion yeah and I think of course distinction needs to be made but you have to look at the
15:31
majority of what people are doing is you know painting them with a broad brush and saying yeah but the few of you who are who are peaceful have a right to
15:37
protest I think that approach Paints the majority of people as violent it Paints the majority of people as anti-semitic
15:43
too when they're not and so I think that it's important to draw a distinction and at the same time you can recognize what
15:49
the majority people are calling for and if you really wanted to you know get things toned down on college campuses he
15:55
would change course well take me through the steps you all decide to take the fair action of criticizing the
16:01
administration's response but logistically did you write the statement alone did you write the St what happened
16:07
so yeah logistically this is what happened so we were talking about it they said guys we have to write something on this and I was like this is what needs to be said uh from there it
16:14
took a few drafts if you look at my Google Docs right now there's like draft 1.0 2.0 3.0 four you know different
16:20
people are shared on it I got to work with uh Alis and Bell or Jewish caucus share as well cuz she made it very clear
16:25
that she wanted to see the denouncement of anti-Semitism and I said with her in that and said yes that needs to be the case were there other red lines that
16:32
people have what did you have to include yeah no I that was that was one of the biggest red lines is that we had to
16:38
include condemnation of anti-Semitism the other red lines people had mentioned to me was we have to stand with the
16:43
cause for investment and an immediate recognition of a Palestinian state which is what we were able to do and so that's
16:49
an interesting point you all went more than say we affirmed the general rights of protest you said we we stand with
16:55
their specific policy goal of asking these campuses to divest yes Froman that M off of what's in Gaza and to affirm
17:04
the existence of a Palestinian state did that cause backlash internally no not inter actually I was very surprised
17:10
because uh at first I was like I don't know how this statement is GNA you know very similar to my cire thing I was like
17:15
I don't know how this is going to go I don't know how well received it's going to be and they said we think it's great
17:21
let's put it up for a vote and it passed by like 8 to2 right which is like amazing I I think I wasn't really
17:27
expecting that wide of a margin and I was so glad that they gave me the room space and Leadership to do
17:33
that yeah you know I've seen some of your colleagues criticized the statement saying that they didn't feel like they
17:39
were fully a part of the process what have you made of some of the criticism
17:45
and I had read that some people had said that other drafts had gone further in terms of a denouncement of anti-Semitism
17:52
yeah I guess I'm saying like I I know that you got enough support for it to be8 to2 should have been 10 to zero
17:59
yes I I would have loved it to be and and in terms of you know one of the reasons why it wasn't I think it was um
18:05
Joshua said it didn't condemn Hamas well this is about you know College college campuses and what's going on there and
18:10
their demands and I think we did say we want to release of the hostages we did say we want a peaceful two-state
18:16
solution and I think people forget that ceasefire means ceasefire for Hamas too we want them to stop shooting as well
18:22
right so I I I try to address those criticisms I I hear where they're coming from and they all have valid points
18:29
right there was earlier drafts that took the overwhelming approach of denouncing
18:34
anti-Semitism what we were trying to do here is stand with the majority of college students and the majority of
18:41
college students are not anti-semitic the majority of people protesting are not hateful and violent and Hamas ofous
18:47
so that's kind of the approach we ended up taking and obviously we didn't go 10-0 I wish it would been 10-0 you know
18:52
this week right after President Biden's press conference when asked whether the protest had had any material effect on
18:57
his middle eastern policy he said no and I guess I'm wondering as someone who helped get this
19:04
you know worked to get this person elected how does that feel it it's you know it's a little bit disheartening I'd
19:10
say it's it's it's tough to hear someone you know and I work so hard not only did I work so hard young people work so hard
19:17
right and I think growing up as especially in the Democratic party we kind of had this idea of a coalition of
19:22
the ascendant right I'm sure if you've heard the term where as there's more and more young people more and more
19:28
progressives more and more people of color you know the country is getting more diverse eventually you're going to have a point where Democrats are just
19:34
are just running away with it right like that's kind of what we were hoping for but for some reason they found a way to
19:40
break up that Coalition and and give us a cold shoulder but at the end of the day we're still out here you know we're
19:46
still trying to talk with them and see if we can change things and I do see a future where I would love to be right
19:51
there knocking doors again for Biden in 2024 that's what I was going to ask are you going to vote for Biden in November or do you plan to organize for Biden in
19:58
November would sure hope to and I think that's that that question rests more
20:03
with him than it does with me because it it matters on how he goes about this right I If he if he continues on this
20:09
path if he continues to go harder the genocide becomes worse and worse and worse that's going to make it tougher for me but I'm saying if six months from
20:17
now if Joe Biden is continuing to back netanyahu's government are you voting for Joe Biden that's a tough question
20:23
and you know I'm I'm I'm struggling with that every day uh you know I I I haven't
20:29
really quite come to I think at the end of the day I probably would uh is a tough thing but the fact that it's a
20:35
real tough question for me I think should show that it's a it's probably no for majority of young
20:42
[Music] people thank you so much all right you too bye
20:47
[Music] bye-bye when we come back we'll hear
20:53
from more members of the executive board and some college Democrats who thought the statement went too far
21:00
[Music]
21:12
are as College Democrats we are committed to the reelection of President Biden and Democrats across down ballot
21:19
races in every corner of our nation however as representatives of Youth across the country we reserve the right
21:25
to criticize our own party when it fails to represent youth voices as young voters we are well aware that
21:31
come November our votes will determine who wins the White House the White House has taken the mistaken root of a bear
21:37
hug strategy for Netanyahu and a cold shoulder strategy for its own base and
21:42
all Americans who want to see an end to this war each day Democrats fail to Stand United for a permanent ceasefire
21:48
that's part of the statement released last week by college Democrats of America but not every member of the
21:54
group's National leadership supported it and in fact two people on the the 10- member executive board voted against
22:01
it so my name is Joshua Martin I'm a junior from Houston Texas um and
22:07
throughout the past few months uh in my role as National political director I've done things such as organized phone
22:14
banking Tex bankingsales to try to get Democrats elected up and down the ballot so it's
22:20
been definitely a fun Journey Joshua is the former student body president of the University of Houston and when I asked
22:27
Joshua about his decision to ultimately vote against the statement his explanation was twofold um personally
22:34
I've been an adant supporter of the Biden Administration and how it's handled the conflict right now I think
22:40
that as far as the protest goes I think about President Biden's addressed a few
22:45
days ago whenever he said that I think everyone's Pro protest everyone no one's
22:50
against everyone having their free speech no one's against protesting peacefully but whenever you're breaking
22:57
into buildings whenever you're shouting intifa those aren't peaceful forms of
23:03
protest so I'm honestly a fan about how the Biden administration were able to condemn the non-p peaceful protesting
23:10
and I've actually been an adant supporter about how he's handled the conflict so far not only did he feel
23:16
like the statement was alienating to people like him a young Democrat who supports Israel and President Biden I'm
23:23
I definitely uh do not agree with how College Democrats has responded as an
23:29
organization to the conflict um because I think that the rhetoric is too one-sided and there's plenty of students
23:37
within the organization who frankly did not have a say in how the organization
23:42
was going to handle the conflict and which is right why right now they feel um unimportant and unheard but he also
23:49
took issue with the process because he felt it didn't reflect the work of the Jewish caucus chair or represent real
23:57
consensus why do you think the executive board approved the statement I think the executive board approved the statement
24:03
because they are not well educated on the issue and and I think they kind of jumped the gun on something to frankly
24:11
push an agenda that I think doesn't reflect the values of all the college Democrats across the
24:17
country I'm curious you know a lot of your executive board went one way what informs your kind of uh uh steadfastness
24:25
that you think that that was the wrong direction I think it's just what I've been seeing with my own eyes I think
24:31
that what happened on October the 7th was frankly horrific it was a terrorist
24:36
attack and it's something that is frankly honestly heartbreaking the
24:42
things that I'm seeing um as far as anti-Semitism on college campuses are honestly also heartbreaking I see people
24:50
on my own campus who come to me and tell me that they don't feel necessarily safe walking to campus because they they have
24:57
a fear of anti-Semitism so whenever I see those things those are the things that push me in one in that certain
25:03
direction and which is why I'm so passionate about uh being against anti-Semitism on college campuses is
25:09
that coupled with have you seen the videos of you know folks in Gaza or or the the destruction from uh Israeli you
25:17
know ping in in the region I mean I'm It's Curious that it seems as if like some of that um you're saying both that
25:25
you want both to be mentioned but it seems as if the kind of sympathy driven is only coming from one side I guess I
25:31
haven't heard the other side and I feel for the people in Gaza that are suffering but I think that the reason
25:36
why they're suffering is a result of Hamas the terrorist group and I think that if we truly want the Palestinian
25:42
people to be saved then we need to get rid of Hamas thank you so much Joshua I think you've been clear and I and that's
25:47
what we want in so I appreciate that thank you if Joshua's biggest problem was that
25:54
the Jewish caucus chair's concerns were ignored I figured we should talk to her directly Hi how are you hello thanks for
26:02
doing this I appreciate your time how's it going thank you um I'm doing great thank you for inviting me to speak on
26:08
behalf of Jewish students I really appreciate it Alison Bell is an NBA student at Meredith College in North
26:15
Carolina much like Hassen Allison could not have predicted what her role as caucus chair would come to include I
26:22
don't think any of us really knew what we were getting into or what was what was going to be happening um once did
26:28
happen obviously my role grew so much I
26:34
immediately I think felt a responsibility to share what was happening with at least the people that
26:40
were were Jewish students on college campuses um right so I run the social media accounts for the Jewish caucus and
26:46
so we started just making sure that we were covering the news of what was happening and making sure that Jewish
26:52
students felt like we were here we were listening we we understood the pain um
26:59
and we were asked relatively soon to start writing a ceasefire resolution
27:06
along with the head of the Muslim caucus to help CDA have like a a permanent stance on their on their Instagram page
27:12
and what did you think of that I knew it was important and I wanted to make sure
27:19
that my caucus felt represented and so I was more than happy and open to work
27:25
with the Muslim caucus on writing something that we both felt represented both of our members both of our caucuses
27:32
and that also spoke for CDA as a whole and so I think that we worked together
27:38
really well we were able to have conversations and disagree openly and then after that was passed what we saw
27:44
was the executive board posting things that were more one-sided and I actually
27:50
had to have a conversation and said like hey what you're posting doesn't actually represent what we what we said in the
27:56
statement um and at that point we were told importantly I think that anything
28:02
in the future that came out about the Israeli and Palestinian conflict would first be run by me and Hassan we kind of
28:08
became the unofficial official Point people for that conflict and um yeah
28:14
obviously cut to today that matters so when the college Democrats were going to release a statement on the most recent
28:20
anti-war protest Allison had the same expectations as before that she and
28:26
Hassen would be equal partners I believe that everybody has the right
28:32
to advocate for what they think is right um and so I was happy to include
28:38
peaceful protests and protection of peaceful protests in our statement I don't necessarily always agree with
28:44
what's being advocated for but that shouldn't matter as long as you're doing so peacefully I think I think that
28:50
that's okay obviously what we have seen is that many of these protests haven't
28:55
been peaceful they have been calling for for Jews to go back to Poland they've been calling for anata and
29:03
anti-Semitism is rising at an extent that I've never seen in my lifetime I've seen more anti-Semitism in the past two
29:10
weeks than I ever have and so at these protests or generally um I would say generally a lot of it is online as well
29:17
but in support of these protests the president tried to make a similar point I feel like in his remarks that there
29:24
was an Embrace of the idea of peaceful protest while trying create a distinction between some of the actors
29:31
that folks have seen at some of these protests what did you think about the words the President Biden said and then
29:37
as's a followup to that that then how was it in CDA trying to develop a response to that so I respect and
29:45
appreciate that Biden has stood up for what is right um and for and for Jewish
29:50
students despite the fact that it might mean that he loses voters within College Democrats and I think the college
29:58
Democrats wanted one narrative in their statement which is what we saw which is
30:03
why it was so one-sided and so to know that the administration went in the direction of completely ignoring that
30:09
sentiment um for the sake of pushing one narrative I think was alienating not
30:16
only to our caucus but to Jewish students were you surpris I mean I'm guessing when did the when did the tide
30:21
turn like at what point did you kind of lose touch with what eventually becomes
30:27
public so I was asked to coate a statement with Hanan we did that we brought it to the
30:33
executive board they didn't like it they said we want a 50/50 approach so we went back to the drawing board we we worked
30:39
together for multiple hours for multiple days to get this done and it was put up to a vote on the executive board and it
30:46
was ultimately voted down um and replaced with the statement that was released they took the statement we
30:52
wrote I think they pulled pieces out of it and then they wrote their own thing and and that's the statement that passed
30:58
is 8 to2 and I will say you know I was
31:03
allowed to read it before it was passed I gave feedback I said this is one-sided
31:09
it's anti-semitic and so what about the statement do you believe is anti-Semitic I think what's anti-semitic is that they
31:15
removed everything about anti-Semitism so we had specific
31:20
examples of what have what has been happening to students across the country we listed the violence that they have
31:27
faced and we had more we had stronger language denouncing anti-Semitism and so to know that the members of the
31:33
executive board had gone in and intentionally deleted all of those examples and that wording in favor of
31:40
something that wasn't a strong stance against anti-Semitism was anti-Semitism
31:45
and so that was that was the concern but the rise of anti-Semitism is mentioned in the statement yes yes they the two
31:51
lines I believe that are in there were pulled specifically from our statement it's true so I don't I I just don't want to say that there was no of
31:58
anti-Semitism in the stat you are saying is that there was not mentions of of specific instances of anti-Semitism and
32:04
it was not the larger focus of the statement as you wished it to be I'm saying that it seems to me that the word
32:10
anti-Semitism was put in that statement as a cover it was you can't say that
32:15
we're anti-semitic because we've used the word we've said that we denounce it but but that's it it was a footnote it
32:21
was one or two sentences they specifically removed instances of anti-Semitism on College on college
32:27
campuses um the harassment that Jewish students are facing and and stronger language
32:32
denouncing anti-Semitism and so I think I think that matters I think
32:39
that's it's important people know that that took place within within this organization you think the focus of the
32:44
statement should have been the anti-Semitism at the protest I would have liked to Echo Biden's Ironclad
32:50
commitment against anti-Semitism on college campuses I'm wondering how you feel about college Democrats going
32:56
forward like how is has this changed your relationship with the organization I don't see myself staying in CDA when
33:03
there's no accountability no inclusion and just a general feeling of not being welcome you plan to leave the
33:08
organization I believe so that's my thought right now I don't think that it it represents what I believe to be right
33:15
and to be clear you'll be voting for Biden in November absolutely MH thank you so much I really appreciate it that
33:22
was really helpful thank you so much but no matter the concerns of Allison and Joshua the overwhelming
33:28
majority of the Executive Board of college Democrats of America did vote for Hon's statement so I wanted to make
33:35
sure I heard from someone in that majority I called Sanjay morali Thon the
33:41
national vice president of the college Democrats of America uh I'm a second year political science major here at
33:47
University of San Diego additionally I'm the national vice president of college Democrats of America and a DNC member
33:53
which I received as an ex official seed through my position as National vice president sj's interest in politics didn't start
34:00
with the Biden campaign I mean I think for me it really started uh back in 2020 during the presidential election my mom
34:06
was a huge supporter of toy gabard and I kind of fell into that rabbit hole I ended up being a huge Andrew Yang fan
34:11
and he was kind of my way in he kind of interesting appro uh showed me that you can be involved in politics um as a
34:18
regular person and through that um I started just looking at ways to get involved once I came to college um I'm
34:24
happy to be the national vice president fighting for the best interests of Youth across but I really wanted to ask him what
34:30
message were the college Democrats trying to sim President Biden and what did he think about the criticism of his
34:36
peers when you all decided to make the more recent statement condemning Biden's response I understand that that was that
34:43
was a process that took multiple iterations why was that why did this plan
34:49
shift um I think the first statement that was written had a very clear and poignant message of of standing against
34:55
the anti-semitic instances Within These protests and I think that's a very important um facet that we need to
35:00
mention within our current statement we do mention that anti-Semitism has been up over 388 per um for islamophobia it's
35:07
being 216% and we make it clear that we condemn all instances of hate and while that is a vital facet um of our
35:13
statement that should that shouldn't be the sole message that we're expounding right we wanted to stand with our own
35:20
and that meant standing both with um Jewish College Democrats who have received hate but also the college
35:26
Democrats of largely their faith um communities coming together to stand um in favor of um a Palestinian State a
35:34
two-state solution so um I think it was the message within the first statement
35:40
was fantastic it's just that it was lacking a lot of a lot a lot of other sentiments that we hope to include did
35:46
you hear from anyone nationally after you all put out the uh most recent statement No and this came after a lot
35:54
of um news sources did reach out to um the Biden Administration as well as higher ups into DNC um for common so
36:02
does that surprise you I mean to an extent yes um I think
36:08
as College Democrats it's our job to make it clear where young people stand um this was really a call to action
36:15
rather than a criticism a call to action to do the right thing um and ensure that
36:20
the best interest of Youth are being um harbored at the highest levels of our political system right um and it is a
36:28
bit disheartening um to know that it wasn't received and considered by those
36:33
at the top right because young people are a bital coalition for Democrats in 2024 and if you're looking at the
36:38
numbers it's not great um a recent poll showed that um support for Biden among
36:44
youth from 18 to 29 has fallen from 60% in 2020 to 45% right so if anything um I
36:50
would strongly urge the party to work alongside us right we want to work with you to ensure that young people turn out for Joe Biden in 2024 yeah I was going
36:58
to ask you I mean I've been asking all the young Democrats this question do you think Biden has a problem with young
37:03
voters right now I think as it stands presently yes um and this is primarily
37:10
due to Israel Palestine right um a lot of young people um presently view America as um an Arbiter of the wrong
37:17
side of History right so I think that generational disconnect is definitely not um going to play well for Biden in
37:24
2024 um as a member of the DNC are you going to Chicago are you planning to
37:31
organize or advocate for Biden has this shifted any of your plans in terms of how you plan are you going to interact
37:38
politically with this election well yes uh so I will be going to Chicago since I am a superdelegate
37:45
and listen we're a Biden backed organization right we've endorsed Joe Biden in the past and we stand by that
37:51
and I also am someone who personally supports the president I mean as someone who has been an unequivocal supporter of
37:57
climate Justice right someone who's um set carbon emission standards lower than anything we ever seen someone who's yeah
38:03
yeah I'm asking about you and Biden though I'm saying are you going to be actively talking to other young people
38:10
and making the case for Joe Biden in between now and November listen I'll be doing my best I think he's done great
38:15
domestically and I will be making that case um however it's I would be uh
38:20
disingenuous I'd say the present case that I have is going to land well with young people right as know you feel like
38:25
it's you do not have the tools to that I feel like I will do my best I mean I as
38:31
I said before he's been arguably the most Progressive president um in modern history I'm a huge proponent of worker's
38:36
rights I think the UAW strike was historic and for our president to stand I'm in solidarity with them it's
38:41
revolutionary right but as it stands that's just not the focus of what young people are currently paying attention to
38:48
we can have all the resources all the Manpower on the ground but if we're given a broken script it's very difficult to um turn that into something
38:55
that's conducive to exciting young people you you know we talked to we actually were in the Biden Campaign Headquarters talking to the deputy
39:01
campaign manager around November I believe and I asked him about the
39:08
importance of uh what was happening in Gaza as a political issue and the answer
39:14
was essentially that they believe that other issues will matter more for people come November that you know they will
39:21
prioritize more domestic concerns and historically we've not really seen voters prioritize foreign Poli policy in
39:27
American elections now why do you think for young people for this generation for
39:33
j z why is this issue um of such I guess
39:39
I'm not I'm not kind of disputing the facts here I'm saying why do you think that kind of political um explanation of
39:45
people prioritize domestic concerns why is that not true for your generation well yeah I really appreciate that
39:51
question I think it's something that's important we address if we look at 55% of Voters from 18 to 29 stand against
39:57
adding more funds to Israel right and the reason um why that is a major concern is that for young people um
40:05
there's a difference in how we receive a lot of our information right we don't really um rely on cable news that's kind
40:11
of filtered through an established Network we get the raw uncut footage straight through social media on Tik Tok
40:17
Instagram um YouTube and all these other sources right so if you watch cable news and if you watch Tik Tok massive
40:24
disparity on how um the war within the Middle East is portray right so that's
40:29
the first part of it I think the second part of it also comes down to just um our differing view when it comes down to
40:36
International politics right so for us there's this major emphasis of ensuring
40:42
that there's a just Community both not just within America but outside of it right and that trumps any type of
40:49
geopolitical interest for sure last question is like what do you think where do you think this goes like when we're in Chicago we'll be I'll be there too
40:56
like do we think that Joe Biden will be met by hordes of student protesters that is too late to tell I
41:03
feel um it it's all in his hands right I think that um if he can U make it clear
41:08
that he stands for ensuring a peaceful two State solution um actively works both with the Israeli and Palestinian
41:14
camps and ensures that funding to Israel is um a conditional reality rather than
41:20
one that um occurs no matter what actions nyatu decides to engage in um
41:25
then I think that this um that these protests and the this uh General
41:31
sentiment among students will die down right but I think it the balls in his court thank you so much for your time I
41:36
really appreciate it sounds good thank you so much for having [Music]
41:43
me Sanjay makes an important point jiny isn't just younger than other
41:49
Generations it's more diverse consumes news differently and to the frustration
41:54
of some is radically rethinking it's Rel relationship to power even in groups
41:59
like The College Democrats of [Music]
42:25
America that's the run up for Thursday May 99th 2024 and now the
42:33
rundown Trump's criminal trial in Manhattan continued this week I would say this is one of the biggest weeks we
42:39
have seen in testimony so far we're three weeks into testimony uh this was a dramatic week and we called our
42:46
colleague Maggie Haberman to catch up on what happened so in court this week there were two major events that
42:52
happened one is that prosecutors introduced evidence of the false business records which are at the heart
42:58
of the case specifically the New Evidence introduced were the checks Trump wrote to Michael Cohen his former
43:05
fixer and secondly there was the direct questioning by prosecutors and then
43:11
cross-examination initially of Stormy Daniels who was the porn star who was
43:18
paid this money Stormy Daniels testify in her testimony Stormy Daniels laid out
43:24
in really lorded detail at various points her first interaction with Trump this
43:30
sexual encounter in a hotel suite uh after meeting him at a golf tournament
43:36
and then their interactions after that she also described a lot of Shame around
43:43
her sexual encounter with Donald Trump and then later all of the media attention around her story about meeting
43:50
with him we should be clear that Trump in the past outside of court has denied that any sexual encounter happened by
43:57
having Daniels tell her story and talk about her encounters with Trump the prosecution was trying to clearly lay
44:04
out that this relationship would be something that Trump wanted to conceal
44:09
well it was a bad day for the prosecution but the testimony was far from clear the testimony went outside
44:15
the bounds several times of what Justice Juan Maran had said was allowable the
44:21
defense lawyers objected several times and a number of those objections were sustained as the the proceedings
44:27
continued Trump seemed increasingly upset he cursed twice in court this week
44:34
the judge made clear in a sidebar that we saw in a transcript after court had ended that it was Audible and he
44:40
admonished Trump's lawyer to get control of trump suggested that he might have to hold him in contempt again and the
44:46
penalties for being held in contempt are continuing to grow Trump has already been find
44:52
$10,000 one for each one of these violations of the gag order uh the judge
44:57
has made clear that he doesn't think that those penalties are affecting anything in terms of Trump's behavior
45:02
and has said emphatically that he is not ruling out the possibility of jail for Trump even though he also said that's
45:08
something he wants to avoid I have to watch every word I tell you people you ask me a question a simple question I'd
45:14
like to give it but I can't talk about it because this judge has giv me a gag order and said you'll go to jail if you
45:22
violate it outside the courthouse on Tuesday Trump had a few Choice words for
45:28
the gag order and frankly you know what our constitution is much more important than jail it's not even
45:35
close I'll do that sacrifice any day and two of Trump's other criminal trials in
45:41
Georgia and in Florida are likely to face delays this week both cases are now
45:47
even more unlikely to begin before election day finally both President Biden and
45:54
vice president Harris are on the trail this week on Wednesday Biden held a campaign event
46:00
in Racine Wisconsin and Harris held an event in Pennsylvania focused on access
46:06
to abortion care there are 67 days till the Republican National Convention 102 days
46:14
until the Democratic National Convention and 180 days until the general
46:20
election we'll see you next week
