A Divided America Agrees: We Deserve Better Than This



0:02
one week ago today my colleague Anna was in Kenosha Wisconsin in the rarest of
0:09
circumstances sitting in a chapel on the banks of Lake Michigan in a room of about 500 people pretty evenly divided
0:16
between Republicans and Democrats with a good number of Independents as well this was the braver Angels
0:24
convention a nonpartisan group Committed to finding common ground people were lanyards with their
0:30
political affiliation red for right leaning blue for left yellow for
0:37
independent and this evening the pews were packed for the main event the presidential
0:43
debate as the debate got underway the group sat largely in silence
0:50
Sil I really don't know what he said at the end of this laughing occasionally at a trump
0:57
quit or Whispering nervously about Biden to do but then came the first commercial
1:03
break um my name's Cory Z Corey wearing a blue lanyard got up to speak I have
1:10
been cringing the entire time I've been watching this um to the point where just
1:16
listening to Biden talk and responding he's really not
1:22
responding in my opinion Trump's wiping the floor with him in this debate if you
1:27
if you want my honest opinion and it's to the point watching this where I'm
1:33
considering flipping my vote like for me because I'm listening to Trump respond
1:39
to this and respond to he's doing the same thing he always does where he doesn't really answer the question
1:44
that's being asked until like the very last second but he's convincing me and
1:49
it's t that's taken a lot hey thank you for sharing that and thank you for saying that on the floor here it's
1:54
really really interesting what she saw on the screen horrified her and was causing her a sort of crisis of faith
2:01
and she wasn't alone can I ask you what did you think of the
2:08
debate I thought it was a reason to drink not that the braver Angels
2:13
convention I wanted to like just lay down and cry because I'm like I don't want EI either of these people as my
2:18
president why can't we have someone better and not nationally the latest National poll from
2:24
The New York Times in Sienna College shows Trump leading Biden by nine points among registered votes
2:30
a significant shift in the weeks since the debate but what's also become clear in
2:36
the short time since the debate is that no matter the Public's reaction to Biden's
2:41
performance there's no clear path to replacing him as the Democratic nominee and those in top positions in
2:48
the Democratic party have continued to Rally around him so when I arrived to the conference
2:56
the day after the debate I thought the braver Angels could could serve as a focused group of sorts albea the hyper
3:03
engaged one given that they've all chosen to spend their free time debating policy issues and
3:10
politics this unique political moment exposed the gap between voters and party
3:17
leaders now that it's out in the open what if anything comes
3:23
next today has Biden's debate performance made his campaign untenable
3:30
from The New York Times I'm aad hearnen this is the
3:38
[Music] runup Hi how are you hi uh my name is
3:45
this is Anna we're from The New York Times a few days after the debate I caught up with Cory on a bench outside
3:50
the conference and we were just wanting to know if we can chat with you for a little bit absolutely i' since learned that she works in healthcare and I
3:57
traveled here from Ohio for the conference nwor as a surgery schule now I wanted to get a clear picture on what
4:03
brought her to that moment on Thursday night I see you have on the blue badge are you someone you consider yourself a
4:09
Democrat uh I the more I'm here the more I'm starting to consider myself more of a purple um there's some things I tend
4:16
to lean conservative on other things I would say probably for this purpose I do tend to lean more Democrat but I
4:21
wouldn't say I'm a full-fledged Democrat by any means and is that a direct result of your time in in in the organization
4:27
I'm saying are you have you typically voted for Democrats typically yes I do I do tend to vote Democrat because that
4:33
just what aligns more with me yeah yeah you mentioned some of the issues that have come up here that's CS you kind of
4:38
to question some of that can you tell me what that is um one of it was the debate watch party to be completely honest that
4:44
was a big one um this Thursday yeah watching the debate and seeing who is
4:50
representing the Democratic party or who they've chosen as assuming that they've chosen um as a blue myself I'm like
4:58
we've got to pick someone better so that is starting to make me question okay re-evaluate some things about where my
5:05
values are where I align with a lot of the issues and things like that and kind of re-evaluating myself if that makes
5:11
sense uh you know we watched the debate too can you tell me what specifically made you think about reevaluating your
5:18
party Alliance from that um as big of
5:23
a farce as it was I think listening to Donald Trump one of the biggest things that struck me and what's stuck with me
5:30
is listening to him say that he believes in the exceptions to abortion that is not something I have ever heard before
5:35
because I really didn't follow Donald Trump prior to listening to the debate um and hearing that really kind of Dev
5:43
vilified him for me because I thought you know I was under the impression as a blue I believ the lie that people will
5:50
tell about Trump and that he just wanted to abolish abortion altogether which I am not for so that really struck me and
5:57
really brought me to Maybe maybe I really kind of need to listen to more of what he's saying and reevaluate you know
6:03
where my feelings actually lie so when he mentioned his position on abortion because it was different than the kind of most extreme positions that other
6:09
Republicans have had and what you have kind of assumed he would have it made you think maybe I could be more open to voting for him absolutely absolutely so
6:16
is it Trump winning you over in that debate or did Biden lose you in that debate I think Biden lost me in that
6:22
because I mean I know he I I I don't really know how to phrase it because I just feel like part of the point of this
6:30
organization is to look at the other side and evaluate and be able to be open to listening and you know I'm not fully
6:36
committed to switching my vote yet but I am considering it I'm doing you know I still have to do more research and I
6:43
want to listen to the the next debate that happens and after that I'm pretty
6:48
sure I'll be able to make my final decision on whether or not I'm going to switch so right now you feel like you moved from saying I'm going to vote for
6:53
Biden to being more undecided yes you know so much of the debate reaction has been about Biden's present
7:00
did that factor into it for you or was it really a policy thing for you I think it was a combination of both it just
7:06
made me feel sad for him because for me watching the debate it felt as if he was
7:12
clearly forced to be there I think he loves this country I think he wants to do what's best but I don't think he has
7:18
the mental capacity I think the debate really showcased that I think seeing Trump being a little bit younger and in
7:25
much better health much more able to articulate even if it you know wasn't always the nicest um I think that
7:33
does play a part in that for sure I imagine it's not just one issue for you
7:38
when you think about the office so I can see how Trump can kind of win you over on abortion but he certainly has you
7:44
know doubled down on some of the things that he's always been about about kind of harsh immigration policy uh you know
7:51
refusal to accept the results of the election how do you square your kind of openness with him on abortion to I
7:58
imagine whether the some of the things that still make you uncomfortable about him that's a good question and one that
8:03
I really think needs more thought for me to answer in any kind of intelligent way what I will say is that I have voted for
8:10
Trump in 2016 and then watched the four years I didn't like what I saw character
8:15
wise and I think that's where I'm having to re-evaluate because a lot of why I didn't like Trump came from his
8:21
character flaws he is not a nice person he is not someone that I would enjoy
8:26
talking to if I saw him on the street but if he's doing what is best for the American people then that's something
8:33
that I'm I don't want to say I'm willing to overlook but let slide for the purposes
8:40
of bettering the country as a whole did you vote into the 2020 election I did you vote for who Biden you voted for
8:46
Biden 2020 went from Trump to 16 Biden 2020 Biden has made the argument that Character Matters it seems for you
8:54
though it's kind of sliding in the rank of priorities is that fair to say I I I
8:59
think it is um I I do believe Character Matters but part of why people seem to
9:04
like Trump so much is not necessarily because he's a nice person but because he gets the job done and I mean Biden
9:11
has his own things that have come out about him and you know those have to be taken to account as well I think
9:18
Character Matters but I think where they stand on the issues matters a little more at this point um my sister is a
9:24
very Avid Trump supporter she thinks that he did a lot of good for the country in 2016 when he was elected did
9:30
I at the time did not and I still stand by that I don't think he did as much as people think he did I won't deny that he
9:37
definitely did some good but I don't think he is the president that everybody thinks he was during that time but we've
9:44
had many conversations about you know his issue of abortion and where I stand
9:49
or you know January 6th has been a big one that we've talked about I definitely think Trump contributed to that in the
9:56
way he was talking to people but then I listened to the B and he's like well I saw things were getting out of hand I
10:01
tried to get help but the mayor of DC didn't want it so that was another thing that kind of skewed my I won't say
10:08
skewed but definitely made me think a little bit more but that's a really good example January 6th has been a big one a
10:13
big yes absolutely uh it's interesting though because when Trump says that on the stage you could reject it and say
10:20
that he's not telling the truth but you seem to be pretty open to the idea that maybe things were a little different
10:25
than I had uh originally thought yes okay I I believed him he seemed to come
10:30
off to me as very sincere in what he was saying and that really matters to me at
10:36
this point in my life I'm 38 so I've lived a bit of life I have more life experience even from 2016 to now I've
10:43
had a lot of life experience and um I think that plays a big part in deciding
10:50
how to vote and I mean people aren't talking about you know you know RFK Jr
10:56
and how he should have been up there and I do believe he should have been up there and he held his own debate and I went and watched him and he's also
11:02
convincing me you know by listening to him so it's still a really big it's
11:07
really up in the air You' got all you you at this point you're considering all three options yes absolutely that would
11:13
be accurate oh well I mean I I I thank you for chatting with us an undecided voter in Ohio means a lot so uh you know
11:19
you got a big decision on your hands yeah I've heard Ohio is a Battleground State and that it can it can swing
11:25
presidencies either way so it's it's a big decision for sure
11:30
more from braver Angels after the
11:36
[Music] break originally we came here to watch the debate with the braver angels
11:43
because this is a group with a theory that open conversation and respectful debate can Bridge America's political
11:50
divides and help bring the country together the braver Angels movement
11:56
began in 2016 after Trump's election when the group started running workshops
12:02
seeking common ground and a bunch of people showed up people who said they were having trouble talking about
12:08
politics with their relatives or people who found themselves having political disagreements with friends and community
12:15
members nearly everyone that we spoke to at braver Angels had a story about a
12:20
personal experience that led them there well when I was about 20 years old I was in a relationship with a conservative
12:27
and I'm very left leaning and he basically told me that he couldn't be with someone like me I was just terrible
12:33
and he he just how the vision showed up everywhere as a as a blue teaching in a red community and being married into a
12:40
mostly red family just brought up all types of questions and I was very
12:46
polarized I guess in the most intimate ways and I the way we got to bra Angels
12:51
is because he and his brother had a pretty upsetting conversation we were dating and it was around race and and I
12:59
didn't know whether or not these two men were racist I literally didn't know and I was in the house with them and so I
13:07
was tearfully crying thinking I wasn't going to be able to be with the man I love because he and his family were
13:13
racist so I Googled how to have a conversation with potentially racist people and braver Angel I mean what else
13:21
am I going to do so I Googled and braver Angels came up and so I brought him and
13:26
my sons and we as a result we all five of our kids Now understand the braver
13:32
Angels Concepts and model and practice it in their lives and they many of them
13:37
most of them date interracially as well so these topics are really up in front and while I was interested in what
13:44
people had to say about divisions in America I also wanted to keep asking about Thursday night because it felt
13:51
like a watershed moment
13:59
so during lunchtime we saw out a table of braver angels from different ideological backgrounds and decided to
14:06
introduce ourselves we met James and Caroline a split red blue couple from Brooklyn
14:13
Caroline is a Democrat and James is a republican they were having lunch with another split family Erica and William
14:21
who live in Texas and their son Alex I actually thought that that Thursday
14:26
night was one of the least polarizing things I've seen some time because almost everybody not just here where
14:33
it's a little preaching to the choir we're all we all care enough about it that we we showed up here but people
14:38
I've seen they almost everyone agreed on the topic that America has got to do
14:44
something like if you talk about shared values I think a shared value over many
14:50
many many Americans no matter where they are and individual issues share the value that we need to have an election
14:57
that better represents us than what we saw on Thursday night I bet you there are magga people and progress and
15:05
everybody many many people in in the nation that would agree on that one thing below that we start from the value
15:11
of we care right all of us can agree we care how we care and what that looks
15:17
like well now that's the discussion but we're start the floor is we all care C you and as a republican did you think
15:23
the Thursday night uh was was something that you know did you agree with what she says that it was a kind of a agent
15:29
about like um uh that being something that Americans should not want to see representing you know them in the
15:34
presidential election I I think that that all Americans of Goodwill would be saddened
15:42
by Thursday night like you know to see our president sort of unable to answer
15:49
simple questions and all that um I think all Americans would be concerned would
15:55
be concerned for him personally would be concerned for the Office of the President um I think everyone would agree that it
16:02
was pretty uh pretty sad um considering you know how y'all are talking about
16:08
Thursday I'm curious what you plan to do in November like like do you have a do you know who you're voting for do you
16:14
have a plan you how what do you think about the country in like the next five months I know I get kind of get what you
16:19
think about where we should go in a broader sense but it seems like we got a little rocky road ahead of
16:24
us we do yeah for sure well I for me I am
16:29
although I don't think Biden has any idea where he is whoever's running the show over there
16:35
I'm I'm a fan of the policy I think the investment in renewable technology uh that was made a couple
16:42
years ago there's a lot of yeah there's a lot of things about what's going on whether he has any idea what they are or
16:48
not that I like right and I'm probably I'm I'm definitely voting for an idea
16:55
and the idea that I think most courts where we'd like to go is is amongst the
17:02
blue side that doesn't mean there aren't many ideas on the red side that I think are part that should be unfolded in the
17:09
future so I do think that we need to prepare for it to be rough it's going to be harder before it gets better and if
17:15
we prepare for that and understand that then we won't Buckle under the weight of what will
17:21
unfold Alex the youngest at the table was more focused on policy than age I
17:27
think I had fall in line with the uh probably if I was to vote it would be
17:33
for Biden I would obviously much prefer uh better candidate select
17:40
options uh I don't really believe in voting third party necessarily it's not
17:46
the most effective use of your vote I live in Colorado so it could potentially
17:52
have an impact um if you vot are you sure yeah yeah
17:57
it's hard to say I do support the administration I mean I live in Colorado Springs specifically the
18:03
chips Act is enabling a semiconductor manufacturer to expand their output like
18:08
it's a huge investment in the community um it's going to have huge Downstream effects for Tech in the midwest say what
18:16
you want about Biden under a historically divided Congress things have gotten done that I think are pretty
18:22
important and uh so I I'd vote for continuation of that but the chance is
18:27
he makes it through the full term are looking pretty low you know and K Harris
18:33
is a pretty divisive person but again I don't really know who's running the show or what's going on there the
18:38
administration seems solid it's pretty stable curious for you too huh well as a
18:44
republican I would like to have a republican candidate to vote for you know um strong defense limited
18:51
government fiscal conservative but there there isn't a candidate right now who represents that so you know I'll I'll
18:58
wind up voting for the Democrat too because I just I can't see Trump in the white house
19:04
again interesting so so we got a universal agreement on the kind of
19:09
Thursday as a bummer for the country but it also seems like there might be Universal agreement that y'all are all
19:15
back in Biden in spite of that well I I will say I I am voting for an idea when
19:23
I vote in November if these are the two candidates but I am we're here to think
19:28
about hope and one hope that I have is that in a representative democracy that we are that the Democrats will have a
19:36
convention um worthy of of you know 1787 and you know and think long and
19:44
hard about who they run as a candidate um it's not too late to make a choice
19:50
and I hope I'm hoping that everything is on the table in November I will make a
19:55
decision but um I get what you're saying that like you're holding out hope that that's not the choice you have to make
20:01
yes I am holding that hope out but I will vote I mean I'll if I if I have to hold my nose and and vote I will I will
20:08
vote thank you all so much this is like left the independ yeah I'm like it's
20:15
a as the conference continued with session topics like trust in elections
20:21
populism in the Republican party and whether cancel culture was corroding
20:26
Society Fallout from the debate to be top of mind for people uh my name is
20:31
Justin Conor including Justin and um I really sort of came here you know actually in part of family reason um
20:38
I've had a very hard times her talking with my brother who has a very very different political stance than I do and
20:45
I was looking for some sort of solution to better understand each other to have better conversations and to sort of
20:52
explore Common Ground finding ways to talk you know more Civ towards one
20:57
another and find genuine policy Solutions he was attending the conference with his mother and her
21:02
husband Steven you know one of the things I remember from the 2020 presidential election is that candidate
21:09
Biden at the time was kind of making an argument about Donald Trump being a being a source of a lot of division and
21:16
that in electing him that we could get the country kind of back to a place of more shared agreement I'm curious for
21:22
you all like what do you think about the prospect of the next 6 months and what effects it could have on you know
21:30
discourse or kind of the shared American story yeah also say for me to me the
21:35
Silver Lining is that it really shows me that it is truly up to us that we live
21:40
in a democracy and we cannot be guided in any significant Way by our political
21:47
leadership and it is up to every single person to be a part of making the world
21:53
that you want to live in but you say you took that away from Thursday can you make that connection for me I did because you know to me I think we sort
22:00
of saw this is an election that not very many Americans are excited about the
22:05
choice that they have and it's a really really unpleasant choice so to me
22:10
looking to political leadership to sort of say oh well they will sort of solve the problems they will sort of figure
22:17
all of this stuff out it's up to our leaders to make all these important decisions for us to me it sort of says
22:23
no we we live in a democracy and it is up to each and every one of us to fully
22:29
participate and Steven was less focused on Silver Linings when we think about November our I mean it seems that all
22:36
everyone's a Democrat here do you are you going to vote for President Biden I'm not no I want to see who President
22:42
Biden puts on as a vice presidential candidate I think we I think he's sticking with the one he has right now
22:48
and I will not vote for either of them he's just getting too old and I'm I'm almost the same age he is okay uh and I
22:56
don't think I'd have the stamina to R chief executive of this country for 4 years and I'm really concerned about his
23:03
health and his uh ability to do that kind of job did you vote for him four years ago no I did not okay did the do
23:11
you plan on voting for uh Donald Trump or or another option I'm I'm looking for
23:17
the for I was looking for the Robert Kennedy option I don't know what what's happening with that campaign it's sort
23:24
of it's fizzling so I I would definitely be interested more more than a third party candidate your primary objection
23:31
with Biden's age my primary well two parts to it his age seems to me to be
23:37
affecting his ability to react sharply as was demonstrated in the debates and
23:43
I'm looking at the president of the United States in terms of the office as the representative of the greatest
23:50
country in the world perhaps and I just don't see that as representation being
23:57
adequate by nature braver Angels attracts optimists or at least people
24:02
who are moved by the group's pitch that people can disagree better but there didn't seem to be much disagreement
24:09
about the debate or the shortcomings of Biden and Trump Hi how are you my name is estad this isna we met Z an
24:16
independent after a session on the ethics of voting for third parties like yeah so I grew up leaning red uh I think
24:23
I would still lean red in a lot of ways um but don't necessarily feel like the Republican Party fits uh some of my core
24:29
values they fit other values I have but the Democratic party has some of my values so uh I don't know where I fit
24:36
now uh in the current state of politics do you know what you're going to do in November I mean you mentioned you're kind of angst about it I'm wondering how
24:42
that's actually translated and what do you think about Thursday night's debate I definitely don't know what I'm going to do Thursday night's debate did not
24:49
help uh I I don't feel like I have a good choice uh if I'm stuck with two choices then I don't feel good about
24:56
either choice right now and so I don't know what I'm going to do it's going to take a lot of study for me personally
25:01
prayer to figure that out it's interesting because I can both totally understand that cuz you know Thursday I don't think was serving that purpose but
25:08
they're also such familiar people that I'm saying like how what do you mean by
25:13
study considering their such known quantities in some sense yes uh so I've
25:19
actually been stuck on this issue the whole time I think the problem is I'm faced with reality where this has been
25:24
the essentially my choice for the last two elections uh where I haven't feel comfortable either candidate and haven't
25:30
had a good alternative and so I don't know what to do uh because for me I I
25:35
don't feel like I'm throwing away my vote by not voting for one of the two parties um I feel like I have to vote for my conscious and if we just kept
25:42
picking the lesser of two evils eventually they're going to get so evil or so you know unaccountable and so bad
25:48
for our country that we're going to ruin the country itself and so I'd rather just not vote for either candidate in
25:54
that situation so is that also part of your equation not just the two qu those two candidates but not voting at all no
26:00
no I would still vote uh I just wouldn't vote for one of the two candidates if I feel like neither of them are going to
26:06
be ones that are actually going to help our country thank you so much I really appreciate it so how how does this work oh so we work for
26:13
the nearly everyone that we spoke to at braver Angels had a story about how
26:18
American politics had changed in recent years there are days I think we're going
26:24
to be okay and there's days I'm scared to death what what days today what have
26:29
the last few days been you want to go jump in the lake with me become more divisive Co was just
26:36
happening and my husband he's a conservative I a liberal and we were
26:43
bickering a lot I couldn't understand why we were so far apart we've been
26:49
married for 23 years at that point and I thought wow this is this is interesting
26:54
but they were also confident that the divisions they experienced against are solvable problem I ran for office last
27:02
year on this platform of being civil My Little Village Council you know people like to see what
27:09
what what was your opinion on septic tank issues you know they wanted they wanted concrete things which
27:17
I think that's where it starts cuz you can't argue with your your neighbors all the time through working through their
27:24
own biases debating finding common ground a lot of what happened this weekend my
27:31
policy positions haven't changed I'm still on almost on most issues pretty
27:38
darn Progressive but I think what's changed is instead um you know how I
27:45
view folks on the other side of the political aisle I I used to wonder to what extent are they evil to what extent
27:51
are they stupid and now that's that seems like ridiculous
27:56
that I ever really thought that most of their solutions to the divisions that they see and experience are on the
28:04
individual level changing hearts and Minds rather than the political parties
28:10
or the system itself the Boy Scout in me wants to sort of like we left the
28:16
campsite better than we found it at least try to leave
28:22
this well better than it is now which you know is in my opinion not good but
28:29
I'm not so sure the lesson of this week is that Americans are uniquely divided according to the data and our
28:36
own reporting most Americans are pretty United on some big things about this
28:42
election they dislike both candidates wish they had other options and think
28:48
President Biden is too old for a second term and in fact the debate only seemed
28:55
to drive home that consensus so is the problem with our politics
29:01
really a divided electorate or is it that the electorate haven't been
29:06
listened [Music]
29:12
to at the end of the convention the braver Angels gathered in the same Chapel where they had watched the debate
29:19
with no Biden or Trump in the room to weigh them down the mood was much more hopeful everyone has voted I believe we
29:27
have a Madam chair they decided to prioritize immigration in their
29:32
workshops what happens in kosha does not stay in
29:40
kosha braver angels leaders called for membership to double in the next year oh
29:47
say can you and to send them off a quet got on
29:54
stage and performed a stirring rendition of the Stars Spang [Music]
30:06
B at the Twilight last happy fourth
30:14
y'all who's brought stripes and bright
30:20
stars through the perous fight
30:28
all the r parts we
30:34
watch [Music]
30:43
so that's the run up for Thursday July 4th 2024 and now the
30:51
rundown this week in the aftermath of the first debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump the New York times in
30:58
Sienna College conduct to the poll I'm Ruth gelnick I'm the polling editor for
31:03
the New York Times and I help conduct our time polls to help walk through the results I called my colleague on the
31:10
polling team so as we get closer to the election we are interested in looking
31:15
not just at registered voters but also at likely voters because we're really interested in people who are actually
31:21
likely to vote in the election right now president Trump is winning by six percentage points among likely voters
31:28
which is an increase from where he was before the debate he was up 3 percentage points among likely voters so depending
31:33
on how you look at it that's about a 2 to 3 percentage Point gain among registered voters president Trump is up
31:40
by an even wider margin he's up by 9 percentage points um that's an increase of where we had him before he was up six
31:47
percentage points among registered voters before the debate so it's certainly a wide Gap and you know we
31:53
often talk about margins of error with these things when this these races are so close and the candidates are so close
31:59
together but when you look at a gap of N9 percentage points among registered voters that really starts to get outside
32:04
of the margin of error and you do actually see that as a lead for Trump and not just a race that's neack and
32:11
neck what these results mean for Biden is the million dooll question you know
32:16
nationally it's not great news for Biden but we are also a country that doesn't vote nationally we vote in the Electoral
32:21
College so I think paying attention to what changes we're seeing in swing States will matter but I think you know
32:27
this is n great news for Biden he lost ground we have 5 percentage points more
32:32
voters saying that he is too old and that was already something that was a majority held opinion it's been a
32:38
majority held opinion all year so I think if Biden is trying to change the
32:43
conversation about his age about his debate performance this tells me that that's not happening and if anything
32:49
those ideas are sort of solidifying in the electorate one big thing we're seeing is more voters are now paying attention
32:56
from pre- to post debate we had like a 10 percentage Point bump in the share of Voters who are saying that they're paying a lot of attention so not only is
33:02
this a sea change in the debate but everybody's tuning in and they're tuning in at this moment that's not so great for Biden which I think is probably
33:09
meaningful for the rest of the race meanwhile the president's team has
33:16
been working to contain the Fallout from the debate reaching out to donors and lawmakers even suggesting that any dip
33:23
in Biden's numbers will be the result of quote overblown media n narratives they
33:29
also released an ad I know I'm not a young man and I know how to do this job
33:36
that directly reference Biden's age I know right from wrong I know how to tell the
33:43
truth and I know like millions of Americans know when you get knocked down you get back
33:50
up I'm Joe Biden and I approve this message and on Friday the president will
33:57
sit for an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos and make a campaign stop
34:03
in Wisconsin there are 11 days to the Republican National Convention 46 days
