MAGA Thinks the Game Is Rigged. Will They Play?


0:01
okay so we're entering CPAC Central that's what it's called CAC
0:08
Central every year at CPAC the conservative political action conference
0:13
there seems to be an unspoken competition of who can stand out the most people wear wild outfits this year
0:21
I saw a trump ball gown $400 Maga sneakers A man carrying his pet cat
0:27
around his shoulders but the thing that I remember most from CPAC this year oh wow was a little booth
0:36
on the ground floor of the conference center so it's um it's a virtualized
0:42
pinball game that oh my goodness has you know different things signifying January
0:49
6 so fake news stop the steal peaceful protest Ashley babbit's Mur political
0:56
prisoners left ramp Awards double freedom custom pinball game built to
1:02
memorialize the January 6th Insurrection I mean actually use the word Insurrection a little bit tongue and
1:08
Chek cuz I don't think it was an Insurrection they the Creator Jonathan lios takes issue with that word 99% of
1:16
the people that went there went there to a trump rally to support the president and so I built the pinball machine that
1:23
tries to bring the truth of what actually happened as opposed to the um
1:29
what I consider manufactured Narrative of what happened on January 6th to him
1:35
the game is a reminder of the great lie of the 2020 election I don't like losing but I hate
1:42
to be cheated and that's what I was reacting to as a visceral reaction and to me it's
1:48
a reminder that for a lot of the CPAC crowd Donald Trump isn't just the former president or even the next potential
1:55
president he's the rightful president because 2020 is not over the election is
2:01
still stolen what's your trust level can you rate it from 1 to 10 in in
2:07
November a 1 to 10 probably a four what were you at going into
2:15
2020 oh I was nine yeah that's that you're saying that's what's changed for you uh yeah absolutely so with Trump
2:23
marching toward the Republican nomination and a rematch with President Biden in November I came to this convention
2:30
center outside Washington DC for a little temperature check on Election
2:36
denial has MAA moved on from 2020 or is the only result they'll trust
2:42
in November a result where Trump wins also I would love can I try it and of course I had to try the game let's
2:52
go right winner mail and ballots voting machines drop boxes you see that up there from The New York Times I'm aead
2:58
hearnen this is the a run covered barely by the media the media is the biggest problem this called
3:07
skill ah sad thank
3:16
[Music] you here's the thing ever since the 2020 election When Donald Trump used his
3:23
platform to spread falsehoods about the electoral system Republicans have been
3:28
in a pickle on one hand Trump and his allies have continued to call the voting
3:33
process corrupt rigged against him and sewn doubts about everything from early
3:38
and mailin ballots to electronic voting machines on the other hand Trump is
3:44
running in the 2024 election and if he's going to win Republicans need as many
3:50
people as possible to participate in that very system however allegedly
3:56
corrupt and this dilemma is of particular importance to the Republican National Committee the party's
4:02
leadership group which has had a bumpy relationship with Trump and is often tasked with leading efforts on voting
4:08
mechanisms and election Integrity so after playing some pinball
4:14
we headed to the main hall at CPAC to hear a speech that was particularly relevant to that problem okay CPAC how
4:22
we doing today quick question where are my magga
4:28
ultra mag of Patriots at today and when we walked in Donald Trump's
4:34
daughter-in-law Laura Trump was on stage well it's great to be back with you guys here again at CPAC this is always such a
4:41
treat to come but I'll tell you guys we have our work cut out for us don't we l
4:47
Trump is currently running for RNC co-chair hoping to be one of the leaders taking over for R McDaniel The Who
4:54
officially said this week that she'll step down next month so some of you may have heard that I've had the great honor
5:01
of being endorsed by my father-in-law president Trump to co-chair the Republican National
5:07
Committee Donald Trump has stoned his support behind Lara and she's expected to Coast through the election easily win
5:15
the position and continue Trump's complete capture of the Republican Party well I'll tell you guys this is a
5:21
position for which I never imagined I would run but I also never imagined that
5:27
our country would be in such dire strength it is time for change it is time to
5:33
fight and it is time to win ladies and gentlemen okay she spent a lot of her
5:39
speech talking about how important a Donald Trump Victory would be and let me just assure everyone here of one thing
5:46
what happened in 2020 cannot and will not ever happen
5:55
again we must adapt and we must fight fire not with
6:00
fire but with dynamite we must and we will build the strongest most secure
6:06
election operation that this party has ever seen that's how we have to do this
6:11
folks she underscored election security but we got to adapt a little then she
6:18
made a clear turn as Republicans I get it we like to go vote on Election Day
6:23
it's exciting to be a part of that day it's exciting to fill out the ballot for
6:28
the future leader of our country heck you even get a little sticker and then you can take a photo and post it on
6:35
social media I know it's very fun but the truth is if we want to compete with
6:41
the Democrats we cannot wait until election day if we want to compete and
6:47
win we must Embrace early voting she advocated for early voting and some of
6:54
the things that Republicans and Donald Trump point to as the cheating that led to the 2020 elction being so can we need
7:02
so many votes banked for Donald J Trump that we're not playing catchup on Election Day you go now Laura Trump was
7:10
saying these are actually the ways that we're going to win every single day up to and on November 5th because this
7:18
November every single legal vote matters she was asking CAC to trust the system
7:24
this time around and that caught my attention thank you guys God bless you thank
7:31
you so after that speech I wanted to check in with some of the leaders at
7:37
CPAC people with large audiences who once pushed the election lie to ask if
7:43
they were thinking about 2024 in the same way can you introduce yourself hi Jack pic senior editor human events and
7:49
the host of human events daily I found Jack poic the farri political activist
7:55
and commentator he was one of the biggest names to promote election denal
8:00
you might also know his more recent work spreading the conspiracy that Taylor Swift is a government saah planed to get
8:07
Biden reelected uh I want to get to what you know Laura Trump was saying on the stage yesterday she was saying that
8:13
Republicans need to embrace early voting that Republican need very ballad harvesting even I wonder what you
8:18
thought right this not just I know who you want to win but how are you all going to win that question seems more
8:23
open uh even among the people here not everyone agrees on that well I I agree there's been um there is a level of
8:29
consternation I believe among a lot of conservatives at sort of the what they
8:35
would say we're we're we're conservatives you know we like conserving things and so for a lot of conservatives and even myself included
8:42
that having one election day where people vote in person with ID checks is
8:48
is something that's very very important to a lot of conservatives and something I certainly would hope to strive for that being said in many of the states
8:56
that are going up for this election uh we do not have those things we have a new system A system that by and large
9:02
came in or at least was greatly expanded during 2020 because of covid rules and um Universal mail and ballots uh early
9:08
voting uh great greatly expanded as well as the dropboxes and I believe firmly
9:14
that the Republicans conservatives whatever you want to call it must Embrace any and all of the above uh
9:21
opportunities to vote vote early get your ballots in get them in the drop boxes and I say hey if you know in
9:27
California you know they started collecting ballots in churches they started collecting ballots in organized
9:32
drives I think those are typ the types of things that I'd like to look at and I'd certainly love to talk with the RNC
9:38
and you know looking at ways to legally uh use these ballot opportunities for
9:43
for the Republicans as well as as the Democrats have embraced it I me the problem here is that Donald Trump continues to assil them right like
9:49
Donald Trump continues to say that uh mail and voting or bot harvesting is
9:54
corrupt even how do you all create those opportunities to win as you're talking about with the leading candidate saying
10:02
don't do it well certainly I think that if Laura Trump is able to get in there at the RNC and look at the rnc's current
10:10
swath of operations uh when it comes to ballots uh we all know obviously she's going to speak to her father-in-law
10:16
about this and about what the plans are to go forward I think everyone knows that she's uh you know big big Trump
10:21
supporter of course and so uh I think that if he sees uh the confidence with
10:26
her operations and her plan for the way forward I think we'll get him to fully embrace it and fully be behind it just
10:32
just I think yall will work on them eventually you'll think you'll get them there by November I guess like it seems
10:38
the big thing to overcome before November you're confident that you can flip that well I think we again we'll be
10:43
focusing on key States so you know we don't have to focus on it for everywhere in the nation four or five key states
10:50
that we're looking at of course uh then expanding that out to you know so you have your your your hard swing States your soft swing States uh obviously
10:57
there are places like Michigan places like M uh place like Minnesota uh even even Maryland with their Senate race
11:02
that are are now coming on board for the Republicans in ways that uh even frankly I didn't even know that Maryland would
11:07
be on board so I think that's that's a huge pickup for Republicans look there's going to be some growing pains with any change but you know I'm fully committed
11:15
to like I said before any and all of the above forms of ballot harvesting ballot
11:21
chasing mail and ballots drop boxes this is absolutely where we need to go and and I've said as such to the president
11:27
himself [Music] Hi how are you my name is estad I host
11:34
of New York Times politics podcast you got five minutes to talk to us you the New York Times podcast yeah we have the New York Times podc want talk to me and
11:41
I'm going to talk to you yeah what do you want to know I first want you to introduce yourself uh so we can have her Mark lven I've been on your New York
11:47
Times best seller list 10 bucks in a row MH MH can you tell me what you do I know that's the obvious question I do
11:54
yes I eat I go to the restroom and then I eat
12:00
Mark Levin is a very popular conservative radio host and some of those Times bestsellers have titles like
12:07
Liberty and tyranny and the Democrat Party hates America he's also been
12:13
outspoken in claiming that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump and advocated for people to quote fight on
12:20
January 6th one of the things we're really interested in here is what should the RNC do around the question of how to
12:28
vote and the larger question of how to win that's a good question as a philosophical matter I don't like any of
12:34
this stuff but the states get to decide so if the blue states are developing all
12:40
these new techniques for voting uh the least of which is actually showing up and
12:46
voting and if Republicans intend to win they have to do the same thing and be better at it look at this election in
12:53
New York the Democrats banked their early votes you had a snowstorm MH
12:58
Republicans didn't turn on their numbers and they lost the seat so I don't like it but it's the nature of the Beast and
13:05
so sometimes you got to do what you don't like yeah I'm interested in that because obviously Donald Trump has not
13:10
taken that tactic he's called it corrupt and even as the rnt has gotten close to trying to embrace things like that he
13:17
stayed away from it does he have to change that language to to have a better chance of winning in November now you're
13:22
interviewing me right I am okay you can ask the president himself uhuh but I
13:27
think I've heard him say we got to get out early we got to vote early and so forth but that's my view I
13:34
just my last question would be like if you could distill what you think this election will be about where would it be won and lost and who you think will
13:40
decide it well that's a lot of questions there yeah I'm just asking you to predict the whole thing he spoke to well
13:45
it's going to be turnout as it always is I ignore all the polls cuz they're not only almost always wrong but what's the
13:53
point what will the election be about what do you think the core issues that are going to be like this the side I think it is going to be immigration I
14:00
think it is going to be uh dinner table issues but I also think it's going to be
14:05
bigger than that for a lot of people a lot of us here think we're right on the precipice of losing our
14:12
country um and we blame the Democrat Party and what Biden is doing by executive Fiat
14:19
what he's doing on the border by executive Fiat what he's done the women's sports by executive Fiat um the enormous amount of spending
14:28
and by the way the Democrats aren't alone in that the Republicans too driving up the debt the interest people now know what that means with
14:34
inflation so this is going to be a very uh meaningful election you know some
14:41
elections are more important than others but the people like me this is a doozy
14:47
thank you we really appreciate your time no problem at all yeah have a great day hi Mark thank you for your integrity and asking
14:53
questions that I think are very interesting I I try I try thank you I appreciate it you should listen to our
14:59
show we have a lot of conservative called yeah the run up you should check it out the runup thank you I will I do
15:06
every now Jack pesobic and Mark Len have
15:12
considerable influence when they talk conservatives listen so it's notable
15:18
that they like L Trump seem to be pleading with the former president and
15:23
his base to accept all the ways it's possible to vote but I was skeptical of how that
15:30
message was Landing especially among Trump space and especially at CPAC with
15:36
the 2020 election conspiracies are still popular we talked to your last year
15:42
remember that okay no where are you from We're from The New York Times we did
15:48
the so I wanted to talk with one of the loudest voices associated with Trump's
15:53
election lies can you introduce yourself again for the microphone Mike Lindell you might remember Mike Lindell for a
16:00
lot of reasons he's the CEO of my pillow a close Ally of Donald Trump and we
16:06
interviewed him last year at CPAC the same year he ran for RNC chair against Ron
16:12
McDaniel but most notably he's an outspoken critic of electronic voting
16:17
machines Lindell said he spent more than $40 million on his cause though recently
16:23
he said he only has $10,000 to his name how are things going these days
16:29
well ever since I came out with the plan to secure our elections in August which is at the lindel plan.com I've been
16:35
attacked and my company's been attacked more than any time in history and you I remember last time you were saying how
16:41
you faced a lot of attacks for you know your previous advocacy but it seems like things have ramped up in the last they ramped it up because it's not about
16:48
flipping the 2020 election I want to get rid of the electronic voting machines and go to paper bell s County that's
16:54
what we're at now I have the perfect plan laid out we got to have fair and secure elections and that's what we're doing my plan I have over 300,000 people
17:01
on the ground in all 50 states I saw an article from the Associated Press recently that said that you know your
17:07
advocacy has cost you financially and that you had work million all I've left is a pickup truck and my uh my house I
17:13
live in but saying last year that you didn't care if it kind of change the thing are you is that still where you
17:20
are yeah absolutely we're trying to save the country here you know one of the reasons wanted to talk to you is because there does seem to be a little bit of a
17:26
split emerging in terms of how people should vote for November I heard Laura Trump you know who might be the next co-chair of the RNC saying she wants
17:33
Republicans to vote almost booed didn't she I was curious about what you thought about that because she's wrong 100% one
17:40
not 99 100% wrong you need to vote same day I know everything about this I've
17:45
studied for three years and put everything I have into it the the early voting is and all that all that mailin
17:51
voting and stuff has to go and if you're a Republican or whoever you are if you're a Democrat it doesn't matter if
17:57
you're person out there and you want but your vote to have the least way of getting it stalled is on Election Day
18:04
from lindell's perspective well L Trump was proposing was not only a mistake for the Republican party but also a
18:11
departure from the vision of the party he helps create the RNC passed a
18:17
resolution and in that resolution same day voting paper ballots hand counting
18:23
Precinct level and voter ID that resolution passed ready for this one 68
18:29
to0 so anyone out there that's with the RNC or anybody thinking about running on
18:34
the RNC and says let's vote early and all this other rubbish Lord Trump is wrong I don't know what else to tell her
18:40
you know and I know her she's a friend of mine she's just misconstrued she's misconstrued she whatever they're
18:46
telling her and the RNC if they're telling her hey come in and be our chair ain't wrong you can't have a chair that
18:52
doesn't understand all the voting process and how we have to fix these platforms and the latest blows to
18:58
lindell's calls a judge recently gave him 30 days to pay $5 million to a
19:04
software expert who disproved lindell's claims that the 2020 election was stolen
19:09
but Lindell isn't ready to give up on the fight not in the legal cases and not
19:15
in the Republican Party leadership you guys you got to go to paper ballots handc counted I can keep taking bullets
19:21
I don't care I'm never going to stop talking about trying to save our country with paper ballots hand C counted and
19:27
everybody vote same day don't listen to anyone on that stage that says anything other than that you don't care about the
19:33
money you're losing huh what do I do I want to become I want of a country anyway I'm out 40 million you know what
19:38
I have left my pickup truck and the house I lived in when it was started I you know and you people say to me all
19:44
the time do would you change anything and would you regret anything no what I
19:50
what I need now is people to donate into the lindel plan.com to finish what we're started we're 90% there when all these
19:56
elections you guys will be think thanking me for still having a job 2 years from now going wow we what a
20:02
concept paper ballots hand counted we got rid of the electronic crooked voting machine beautiful thank you so much I
20:09
appreciate your time man I appreciate it I talked to Lindell at one far end of
20:14
the conference center and pesobic and Leen on the complete opposite side it
20:20
felt like the perfect image to represent where they stood on the issue far apart with compromise difficult to
20:27
imagine but how are the attendees of CPAC thinking about their vote and if
20:33
they can trust it in 2024 that plus Donald Trump after the
20:43
[Music]
20:53
break let's see what we got the first thing you see upon entry is the John
20:59
Frederick shows MAA bus tour Trump for president
21:06
2024 one of the biggest things at CPAC literally was a bus parked in CPAC
21:13
Central on it was a giant head shot of Donald Trump and a lot of people are
21:18
using markers to sign the bus and send a message of support to Trump cops for
21:27
Trump we have your back God bless you people left notes inside jokes I was he
21:35
71 rally so far I want to pick with my press wow it was like the Maga version
21:41
of a middle school yearbook the American dream is real thanks to MAA and American
21:47
first thank you 4547 and show the complete commitment
21:53
this crowd has to Donald Trump the only thing sure about President Trump is Nothing is for sure and that's why we
22:00
love you God bless you and your family sir the real president I wondered how the attendees
22:06
at CPAC felt about the changing tides I was seeing when it comes to voting and Trust in elections were they as open to
22:13
change as the leaders we heard earlier okay had their perspective shifted since
22:19
2020 hi you all my name is estad this is Anna we're from The New York Times we work for the politics podcast we are
22:24
talking to people today about what brought them to CPAC but also what they're thinking about November and Trump's prospects of winning you'all
22:30
have 5 10 minutes to chat with us sure sure a thank you can you tell me your names tell tell me what brought you the CPAC where you from I'm Jim Hansen uh we
22:37
live across the river and we we play this game I'm samanth on a ro and right
22:43
here Arlington cross the river yeah yeah so you all have been to CPAC before yeah we have many times many times you know
22:49
one of the things we've been following here is you know how the Trump faithful talks about certain issues and how they talk about winning you know we've talked
22:56
to people about um whether they trust the results about whether they'll vote by mail things like that would y'all consider yourself Trump supporters just
23:03
to make sure I'm a conservative supporter uh I do not support Trump
23:09
personally I mean if I'm talking about me my personal position on this but when
23:15
he is the nominee he's got my vote I will vote for the Republican nominee
23:20
because I am voting against to the Democratic agenda and Trump's going to be our nominee and I'm actually looking
23:27
forward to I think the interesting thing is now that it looks like the Democrats going to stick with Biden I think he
23:32
might win I was pretty pessimistic for quite a while you think who might win I'm sorry might win Biden is a is a
23:38
great candidate for him to run against because he's basically not there you know he's running against an empty suit
23:44
and I think Trump can rile the crowd up and say were things better when I was President they demonstrably were you
23:50
know is the world on fire it demonstrably is don't you want things to be like they were back in the day and a
23:57
lot of people do so that's interesting you're saying you were skeptical of Trump's ability to win but you've changed in recent time what drove that
24:05
change is it just seeing Biden or or what oh yeah I think Joe Biden has helped Trump's chances of Victory
24:11
immensely by destroying our economy by destroying you know our foreign policy
24:17
by being a pushover that embolden tyrants around the world I can't think of anything he's done right except try
24:24
to buy votes by you know paying off student loans and things like that and I don't think it's working you know I
24:29
think he's shedding constituents at a rate that is unsustainable and I think right now I'd
24:35
put it 5149 Trump if Biden's a nominee you know in there we were just hearing Laura Trump talk about you know taking
24:42
over the RNC or or trying to and she was saying how she thinks Republicans need to embrace voting early I'm curious for
24:49
you all who are conservatives like how have you thought about the way that Trump and the kind of ecosystem has
24:56
talked about the system of voting and really cast out on its legitimacy and then more so what do you think needs to
25:02
happen for November so that the Republican nominee can win it was a mistake for Trump to crap all over uh
25:10
early voting and absentee voting because that's why he lost was a mistake to say
25:15
we shouldn't do it because the left used it and counted every ballot even ones that shouldn't have been so I think that
25:21
being said ballot harvesting ballot banking whatever you want to call it is the smartest thing we can do right now
25:27
because it's the rules if that's the rules play by the rules you know step all the way up to the line on the rules
25:34
and do everything you can because the Democrats are and so you're giving away votes by not doing that we need to
25:41
register get ballots out Harvest those ballots and get them in just to keep up
25:46
it's interesting cuz that makes you know complete logical sense but Donald Trump
25:52
is busy saying the opposite right now and continuing his kind of War on mail and balance and harvesting and calling
25:58
it corrupt and a part of me sees this split screen where I'm like it is the rules and you do have some parts of the
26:05
party who are now saying you have to play by them but the biggest and most important voice is still talking about
26:11
corruption I mean who wins in that you know hopefully there will be enough
26:17
people who are saying look let him because he's not going to get over 2020 I don't blame it all right the there
26:22
were some things he talked about that were not true but that election was the worst election in US history I don't
26:29
think there's been a worse one and I think I'm want to hear you on this because you don't seem like someone who's fully in who just believes everything Trump says so I'm saying for
26:36
you why is that the worst election in history because of what I said about the
26:41
the way they changed the rules in major swing States and they counted ballots that would not have been counted in any
26:47
previous election there were so many things that were done that should have been adjudicated in Trump's favor that
26:52
weren't for whatever reason and I think there were enough votes in those places
26:58
that I think the election would have flipped I think he would have won if the same rules that were applied in even
27:03
2018 were applied in 2020 Trump would have won so I don't blame him I don't blame him for being mad I think it's
27:10
counterproductive to let that override how to win this time instead of looking
27:16
backwards on these things which I think is a kind of a fault of too many people right now and that's what you're
27:22
alluding to let's look forward and you know forward is what we need to do is we need
27:29
to meet the letter of the law and I'm with Jim we need to get our toes right
27:34
up to that line I do not advocate for breaking the law I don't even advocate for cheating I don't think we need to
27:41
but we need to play the game it's like okay it's a football game don't bring a
27:47
basketball okay you know it's soccer don't bring a tennis
27:52
racket it does seem like Republicans are voluntarily disarming on these couple
27:57
points to satisfy you know people's upsetness over 2020 uh for you all like
28:03
if there's a thing that you think the party needs to think about to win in November CU it seems like that's the goal here right like is it this type of
28:10
stuff we're talking about the like strategy logistic stuff isn't a message thing like what would be your you know
28:17
direct message to the Trump campaign if they're listening to this podcast like what would you say that they need to do to win get on the message of bring back
28:24
the good old days all people had money in their 40 1K you know we weren't at war in a bunch of places around the
28:30
world there are a lot of things to talk about that were better then than they are now get off the election you know of
28:37
2020 as the reason for him to win this time and point out that his economic
28:42
policies were better and he will stop the administrative state from destroying
28:47
the lives of people they disagree with mess think forward not backwards 2020 is
28:55
done it's over and we need to focus focus on what's going to happen next we need to look at how we can do it the
29:01
best we possibly can and the message needs to be talk about what people care
29:06
about not just what is going to ignite the fury yeah we can all get mad about
29:12
2020 but okay that was 2020 it's now 2024 and let's do what we need to do now
29:21
by focusing on the issues that matter to people you know what matters you know economics the Border we need to talk
29:28
about crime we need to talk about you know some of our national security policies those are things that matter
29:34
focus on that and focus on 2024 and if it happened before 2024 just shut it
29:41
it's really nice meeting you all I appreciate your time pleasure yeah thank you have a great day y have a great
29:47
day we didn't have to ask to interview the next people we spoke to we are doing interviews we're looking for some we're
29:52
looking for but tell me about yourself well i' I've been to 71 Trump rallies 71
29:58
Trump I think I saw your signature on the Trump bus you said you were trying to get a picture that's right I want a picture with him I've been been able to
30:04
get a picture in the 7 three sign magah hats three sign mag hat sh in his hand he has tweeted me and mentioned my name
30:10
twice he has talked to me from the stage on about eight or nine occasions but I haven't gotten the picture with him yet man I'm I'm sorry for you that's right
30:17
but but uh I've also I was there on January 6th and uh where are you from uh New Jersey why did you what brought you
30:24
to the capital on the 6th uh it would it was it was my 50th Trump rally he was
30:29
given a big speech there it was a rally uh I want it was number 50 for me I mean
30:35
I want I I wanted to I wanted to see my hero uhhuh is there anything was there anything specific to that rally that
30:41
made you like you know that wasn't just a I mean I've been to the Trump rallies too that wasn't just a rally the
30:46
election was stolen it was so obvious and I saw it with my own eyes because I worked as I worked in the campaigns it
30:51
was so obviously stolen and we were angry but we but nobody was plotting to overthrow the government everything you
30:58
hear on the news is a lie talk to anybody who's been there yeah I'm moving on from that I'm actually thinking about going forward um you're I mean if you're
31:05
someone who believes that the 2020 election wasn't fairly decided how do you feel about 2024 I think that this is an honest
31:12
election Trump will win in a greater Landslide than Ronald Reagan I think he'll get all 50 states they been all over the country but I don't think we're
31:18
going to have an honest election I believe the Democrats will cheat like we've never imagined and and I think
31:24
that they will do it so out in the open crimes will be committed before our eyes they will dare us to arrest them they'll
31:30
break every rule it'll be by any means necessary throw everything against the wall and see what sticks so with that
31:37
assumption what should the Republican Party do I mean we just saw Laura Trump saying that you know Republicans need to
31:43
think ahead um that they should embrace things like early voting since you expect Democrats to do quote unquote
31:50
cheating ahead of November what should Republicans do to ensure what I imagine is your desired
31:57
outcome which is that Trump is the next president well I mean where there are Democrat governors in States we're going
32:03
to lose anyhow and cities we're going to lose we're screwed but I think where Republicans are in control we better
32:09
enforce some strong election laws and we better arrest people prosecute them and
32:14
imprison them if they're caught engaging in election fraud it's fraught with
32:22
fraud all over the place I was living in Hawaii during 2020
32:27
and Hawaii doesn't have uh going to the polls and voting they have mail and voting and that's it and the box I had
32:35
to put my ballot in was in an empty parking lot Lord Trump was just on stage
32:41
saying the Republicans need to embrace ballot harven thing that they should be playing you know doing the same thing
32:46
the Democrats are doing as long as it's not illegal go for it is there something
32:52
that could happen between now and November that will make you all trust the election results are you serious the way they are
32:59
the way they are now no no we we need one election day you vote you have you
33:04
have voter ID you don't have voter ID you don't vote we we shouldn't have election month or two months or however
33:10
long that is it's election season now a bunch of that's a bunch of BS thank you all so much for chatting with us can we
33:16

33:55
before no I've been to many You' been too many do you vote in America or no um
34:00
not yet this year I will be voting in America this year this year will be your first I am turn I am uh becoming a
34:07
citizen myself oh congratulations who you going to vote for I think I know 100% you know that already I need you to
34:14
say it though for the microphone yes on Donald J Trump the best president America has ever had uhuh how do you
34:20
confident do you feel in Trump's ability to you know come back I feel confident if they don't rank
34:27
the elections again if they don't steal it I feel confident that he might win
34:32
because you know what what I've been hearing is that people are tired from
34:37
the border Invasion people are tired to see a weak president that cannot um
34:43
represent the United States and this is the biggest greatest country on Earth
34:49
what would make you trust the system you mentioned how you thought was rigged last time I guess I'm wondering like coming up now do you have confidence in
34:55
the election to be fair um not really but I mean we still got to
35:03
do our parts right we still got to come on a vote we still have to
35:09
show patriotism and we still got to do our parts we still got to be honest and
35:15
uh and respect each other and making sure that we are doing whatever we can
35:21
for a better Society do you have any idea of how you're going to vote you know in Florida there's vote by mail
35:26
there's I've heard a lot of people here talk about whether voting by mail is safe or whether they worry about it being corrupt or whether they want to go
35:32
in person have you ever put any thought into like how you want to vote not really because Florida is different
35:39
Florida is you know uh Ronda santis Ronda SST is making sure
35:45
that things stay fair and and the Integrity of the
35:53
elections are kept okay so you say you don't have you don't have any fears about Florida because you think Rhonda santz will make sure Florida is fairly
36:00
count he's been saying that but you know I fear for the rest of the country you
36:05
never know do you worry that like the talk of a rigged election will get
36:11
people some people who even agree with you to not want to participate right don't you have to believe that the thing
36:16
is fair to do it you know I mean doesn't that hurt the chances of trump
36:23
winning look it's it's hard to say
36:29
because I'm a Christian a lot of these people are Christians right the Bible
36:35
tells us there is a book in the end the Book of Revelations that tells us that a lot of rird stuff corrupt stuff nonsense
36:43
it's going to happen and we're going to have to deal with it but we we can never
36:48
stop believing or stop fighting or stop doing what's right have a good
36:55
day [Music]
37:01
ladies and Gentlemen please welcome the next president of the United States
37:08
President Donald J Trump Donald Trump spoke on the last
37:14
day of CPAC this is a nice crowd that's a
37:20
beautiful that's a great honor they have room and while I wasn't expecting him to say endorse mail and ballots or ballot
37:27
harvesting I did want to listen to see if he'd moved on from 2020 or not we
37:34
have to break out of the nightmare that we're in in his speech Trump provided a
37:40
clear answer a simple flowchart to understand how he thinks about
37:46
2024 and the question of election Integrity make America richer and safer
37:51
and stronger and prouder and more beautiful than ever before I think we have a final shot at at it but if we
37:57
don't do well in this next election or if they cheat enough that they can steal it which is I think the only way they
38:04
can win if he loses it's fraud your Victory will be our ultimate Vindication
38:11
if he wins will be our not only is a victory for his base but it's payback
38:16
for last time reward and the unprecedented success of the United States of America will be my ultimate
38:24
and absolute Revenge that's what want success will be our [Applause] [Music]

Democratic primary with 81% of the vote still more than 100,000 people that's
39:24
more than 133% of Democratic primary voters cast a ballot for
39:29
uncommitted after organizers encourag Michigan residents to use the primary to
39:34
protest the administration's handling of the war in Gaza organizers of the uncommitted campaign have been calling
39:41
for an immediate ceasefire and have warned that Biden's failure to change his position could cost him in
39:48
November and in the Michigan Republican primary Donald Trump clinched his sixth
39:53
straight Victory he got 68 % of the vote to Nikki Haley's
39:59
