It Was Only One State, Right? So Why Does This Primary Feel Over?


0:00
[Music] I'm not used to like just the groaning
0:07
of the snow under the car that's like a new experience yeah yeah yeah yeah you can definitely see we're not on stable
0:13
[Laughter] ground also like it's just so
0:20
dark like the quiet is what always gets me yeah but you
0:27
know what sound do I hear
0:34
Ry from The New York Times and for one last time from Iowa I'm estad hearnen
0:41
this is the runup going into the night of the Iowa caucuses where the first votes will be
0:47
cast in this year's presidential election I had been looking for three key things the impact of the cold
0:55
weather Trump's strength and perceived dominance in Iowa and finally finally
1:00
whether there would even be a contest to keep covering after Monday or if a huge Trump Victory would put an end to any
1:07
fight in New Hampshire and Beyond so a couple days have passed
1:13
we've defrosted a little bit and we now have our answers all right it's caucus
1:18
time first on the weather I know it's cold but we need you out there wear some layers bring your ID and bring your
1:25
friends we can do this come on Iowa let's finish iin did break subzero temperatures to come caucus but not that
1:32
many of them there were only around 110,000 votes 40% lower than the turnout
1:38
in 2016 the last competitive Republican primary we can now make a very important
1:44
projection the second question CNN projects that Donald Trump will win the Iowa caucuses CNN can make
1:52
this projection based on his overwhelming lead in our entrance poll of Iowa caucus goers and the polls
1:57
weren't wrong Trump won with 51% of the vote beating his Rivals by nearly 30
2:03
points cementing his status as the race is overwhelming front
2:09
runner so we're going to put America First we're going to make America great again again Iowa we love you you are
2:16
going to oh you just go out and buy larger tractors and more land don't worry about it that led me to my third
2:23
question for caucus night was all this over before it got started and what did
2:28
Trump's commanding victory mean for the other candidates before we head to New
2:33
Hampshire to answer that question I wanted to spend just a little more time with voters in Iowa not Trump supporters
2:41
who got the result they wanted but Republicans who were holding out hope for the non-trump candidates and must
2:47
now grapple with the uncomfortable reality of his dominance so we drove to ases Iowa for cus night at the local
2:54
high school interesting though in first glance you do not see any Trump paraphernalia in this uh Lobby you see
3:01
uh D Sanz 2024 signs you see pikniki signs we're talking about Haley but it's
3:07
not as if we see any kind of like Trump campaign things or things like that interesting Ames is a suburb of De Mo
3:13
it's the home of Iowa State University but for me it's actually more known for producing an impressive track record of
3:19
NBA Sharpshooters like Harrison Barnes and Doug mcder because of the university and its
3:25
proximity to more liberal areas like de Mo it's not really known for being Trump country well welcome to the 11th
3:33
Precinct Republican caucus my is it was a good setting to explore the race for
3:38
second place did you all come here for the presidential [Music]
3:44
poll but they also had a question for these type of Republican voters the ones
3:49
who would prefer a candidate other than Donald Trump now the Trump's dominance wasn't
3:54
just projections and poll numbers but actual physical votes what was their
3:59
plan and what would they do if Trump did trium now it's time to
4:05
vote you should have all received your
4:16
ballot at the caucus site just before the outcome was announced we met voters
4:21
April and Troy Hill who were sitting with their teenage son hi name welome to New York Times we
4:29
host our POS podcast and we're talking to people about why they came out today kind of who they're thinking about caucusing for maybe you have 5 10
4:34
minutes for us to talk 5 10 minutes if you care to I don't
4:40
how about five or less that's awesome um how long you been in Story County for uh
4:47
26 years so this is not y's first caucus no well I think we've been to every
4:53
caucus you have an issue that's the top of your priority list or kind of how you know amongst these candidates you have
4:59
made a call between them um we definitely have a priority list although there are a lot of things
5:06
that seem really important right now and I tend to be a little bit addicted to trying to be aware of what's going on in
5:12
the world um for me life is the issue so to for me that defines everything else
5:17
about a candidate so how they value life every life whether it be unborn or um
5:26
somebody who's new to our country or just every single life to me is
5:31
important and I would consider them in image bearers so um that really defines
5:37
everything and obviously there are a lot of Republican candidates that are saying that they're pro-life yeah um I was
5:44
going to ask like that would that would include all of them if you asked them that you would unless you are Donald
5:50
Trump and you like to col Ronda santis to Pro lifee but yet he's he is
5:56
responsible for the overturning of Rose so I don't know I just don't even know
6:02
what that all means so so so I'm hearing some like Trump's Trump's inconsistency on that has been really noticeable are
6:09
you backing to santis in this caucus we are backing to santis yes when did you make that decision and like when did he
6:15
secure that vote you know we never really said we were committed to
6:20
caucusing for him but I think we've probably been in his Camp all along we sort of watched him really through Co
6:29
and just a lot of issues where things that would represent values
6:34
that we have he seems to be standing really strong for them and kind of unafraid of the consequences and I'd
6:41
rather not have a candidate that kind of blew wherever the wind was blowing so is
6:47
that in reference to Trump or Haley or you know it could be either and I'm honestly not sure because sometimes you
6:54
maybe don't know if they're lying or just saying what they think you want to hear but occasionally I hear Trump say
6:59
something that seems like an out and out lie to me and I'm like that also is inconsistent with my values I wanted to
7:06
ask about kind of to Sis's trajectory over the last six months it certainly uh I think they would even say it hasn't
7:12
lived up to kind of what they wanted when he came in does any of that affect kind of how you viewed your own support
7:17
and what do you think has been uh the problem in terms of getting Dan santis to become the kind of trump alternative
7:23
that a lot of people thought he would be at the beginning uh I'm honestly not sure
7:31
but I feel like I almost wonder if the targeting of trump from a legal
7:38
perspective which in my opinion is pretty bad um if I know that we know a
7:45
lot of people that are Trump supporters a lot really the rest of our family would be supporting Trump in an Iowa
7:51
caucus tonight not at this one but somewhere else and the more that he's
7:56
targeted the more that they don't even hear some of the the things that he says they are just not not going to let this
8:03
happen so um what would success be for Dan Sanz tonight oh winning totally uh
8:10
if he loses I'm not really sure what that means going forward I feel like he has a better chance in Iowa than St New
8:16
Hampshire so uh yeah I wouldn't say that's great but he's also not that old
8:21
and you consider how old Trump and Biden are and you consider how old Ronda santis is and he's a great Governor like
8:27
maybe next time and I've heard that from say my father-in-law who's in his 80s uh
8:32
not this time but maybe next time and I'm okay the last question would be like would you have a if it wasn't a santis
8:38
would you have a preference between Trump and Haley who the nominated uh honestly I
8:43
think I'd probably take I I don't know I might take Vaca over either of them and
8:49
they say he doesn't have a chance tonight but you know what neither does rotten so to speak and again the polls
8:55
have been wrong in the last couple of Cycles so who knows why you ramaswami would be just connect the dot for me I
9:03
don't have a very close second pick to be honest he seems to be kind of all over the place at times
9:10
but having said that our son did uh relief work in Ukraine until August and
9:18
prior to that in the Congo and I think he's pro- Nikki so he's thinks that she
9:24
is more proven on Foreign Affairs or better at that so you know
9:29
maybe if I had a second choice and I were listening to my son I would vote for Nikki I don't know honestly I don't
9:36
know so have a couple minutes I'm curious do you have a moment when DeSantis became you think clearly the
9:42
your choice yeah for me it's been between DeSantis and Trump we voted
9:47
Trump the last two elections and I think he's right there with Reagan as far as
9:52
his track record what he did overall throughout his presidency he finished up a little week with with some things um I
10:02
I think the biggest thing for Trump is being hampered by all the legal issues and I just don't care to see that going
10:10
into a presidency with him having it cuz that can't help but divide your time I'm
10:17
curious is it the is it the allegations of the legal issues or is it just the drama and surrounding it for you that
10:23
makes you think I don't want all that I think it's more so just it seems it's going to be never ending that the people
10:31
that are going after him aren't going to stop and that's why some are really
10:36
digging their heels in and sticking with Trump I will vote for Trump if he is the
10:42
and I won't feel bad about it but I think DeSantis is our better choice and
10:48
I've I've thought that for quite some time Dan santis finishes behind Haley tonight in Iowa is there a path for
10:57
him I don't think so it it's going to be tough and we haven't really believed the
11:03
polls the and I think that's probably a pretty consistent um thread throughout a lot of
11:11
American they're just you know you kind of hear the stuff about the polls and now I think we're just kind of calloused
11:17
and numb toward them I might be a little more optimistic saying hey if he doesn't
11:23
even finish um top three who knows maybe there it's if he keeps on going and gets
11:29
gets some traction and momentum I wouldn't put him out of it but it I think most would say it's a long shot
11:35
but I I still I'm kind of one of those NeverEnding uh
11:41
hopeful I think it's possible kind of thing what if Trump does win in Iowa
11:47
tonight I think it would say to me that there are a lot of people like my
11:52
father-in-law he's a I mean a college graduate but a also a farmer and my
11:59
brother-in-law my husband teaches here at the high school actually but um
12:04
and they are very DieHard Trump supporters and they just love him and to
12:14
some extent Dan santis is a theory Nikki Haley is a theory VC is a theory like in
12:19
theory this is what they stand for now for us DeSantis you can kind of see in his governorship for Trump they would
12:27
say you could see what the look like under his presidency and so they're not
12:32
going to back down from that they are going to say he was a good president and we want him back they are going to be
12:38
very heavily Trump MH well let's see how this goes thank you all appreciate thank you as the votes were counted and the
12:46
precinct Captain gave a speech we also talked to an Ian named Aaron one of the
12:51
younger caucus goers in the room are you uh you in story count are you here the caucus yes who' you caucus for uh so I
12:59
voted for Nikki Haley okay yeah I'm a yeah firm firm believer in moderate
13:06
Republican you know candidates and I think she has a lot of really good qualities I think she is capable of
13:12
standing up for what needs to be stood up for and then I also um just think she
13:19
has the ability to really reach across the aisle and way some of the other candidates maybe won't yeah yeah I mean
13:26
tell me about yourself are you a student how where how old are you you like yeah so I'm I'm 27 years old uh I moved here
13:32
about a year and a half ago I've lived a few different places in the country but I moved here for work um I do a little
13:38
bit of work this is my first caucus it's interesting I didn't really know what to
13:43
expect um I appreciate the way it's ran where individuals get to get up and and
13:49
speak on the candidate but it's a little more controlled of a forum yeah yeah what is your review now that you've gone
13:55
through one just at my table alone talking to people I've never met before
14:01
clearly I live around them uh but able to have a pretty civil conversation about the different candidates who we
14:06
support and some of the strengths and weaknesses that we we see in those candidates so honestly I think the table
14:13
conversation was just as impactful if not more than the speakers that went up no if you're someone who's been looking
14:18
for a moderate were you always with Nikki Haley when this race has been happening I was not no um to be honest
14:26
I'm an Indiana boy I grew up in Indiana I was there when Mike Pence was governor and I'm I'm a big Mike Pence fan I still
14:32
would support him if he were running uh but when he dropped out I didn't know who I was going to go for and honestly
14:40
some of the more recent campaigning that I've seen from the Haley campaign was what what drew me in um would you vote
14:48
for Trump if it's Trump Biden again I honestly have thought a lot about that and I don't know what I would
14:54
do yeah yeah well what would you consider success for Nikki Haley in Iowa
15:01
tonight I think the obvious answer would be a win I think the realistic answer of
15:06
what can you take away would be that second place spot I think if she is able
15:12
to get more votes than Dan santis that sets her up for um a good position I think it really does set her up well as
15:18
you do move on into some other states it's a weird time to be where I don't
15:24
think people are looking at as much the number one candidate that comes out of Iowa they're really curious who is going
15:30
to take that number two spot you know there's some talk about whether Republicans have a young people problem or something like that I'm curious if
15:36
someone who's 27 you know like how do you see kind of your generation's relationship with the Republican party
15:42
yeah I don't think the younger generation wants to not get excited about politics I think there's an apathy
15:49
due to the candidates that are getting put in place and quite frankly the age of the the main candidates is those
15:56
people are there it's just that you know the politics they want to see just seems on you know it's I see how the apathy is
16:03
fueled I mean you're you're saying if it's Trump Biden again you don't know what you would do would you consider not voting or yeah absolutely yeah that's
16:10
definitely something I've considered have you ever not voted in the presidential before I have not yet I
16:16
have thought of it before but this would be the first time yeah cool it's great me tell me your name Aaron Aaron nice to
16:22
meet you after we finished talking to Aaron the results of the caucus have been counted believe and can you read
16:29
them out for us just for the audio sure you get away from uh Haley 82 DeSantis
16:35
42 Trump 29 bik ramaswami 17 Hutchinson 1 and
16:43
Brinkley one a total of 172 but Haley receiving 82 cool thank
16:50
you so much we really appreciate it thank you and to specifically break down this precinct's results we turn to a
16:56
familiar Voice who also cus the would love to get you a reaction to that it seems likey hear it all Teresa Garmin we
17:03
met over the summer a former state legislator and a strong Ronda Santa supporter I'm disappointed you thought
17:10
the Santa would do better no why do you think Iowa came around to Trump I mean
17:16
considering 2016 considering I will say I'm 86 years old we've never had a
17:22
better economy than we had under Trump I just would like to have a president that
17:28
I respected the way he treated people but he did a great job as president as
17:34
far as I'm concerned and that's the that was the biggest reason I think that's the
17:40
biggest reason well we'll look to see how the rest of the state goes too but give just
17:46
give us one last kind of final thought like whoever the C Republican candidate
17:52
is I will be voting for them we have got to change what's happening in this country if we don't get control in the
17:59
next election we're going to be a socialist Nation because we are headed in that direction so we're talking about
18:05
second place but the main story here is if Donald Trump wins again you'll be voting for him in November yes I will be I'll be so much you've been so helpful
18:11
for us but at that point we knew something Teresa didn't earlier in the night as
18:19
the local representative for the Trump campaign was giving a speech we got a push notification declaring Trump the
18:25
winner of the Iowa caucuses before Teresa had her chance to vote for DeSantis or Aaron for Haley it wasn't
18:32
clear how many other people at our Precinct in names knew that information before filling out their ballots but
18:39
Anna and I did and to be honest it felt a little weird so the big news
18:45
organizations have just called the Iowa caucuses for Donald Trump including the Associated Press NBC CBS at our caucus I
18:52
people haven't even voted yet um which they're doing so right now now that the candidates are finished but it speaks to
18:59
just how big this margin might be I guess if these organizations are doing that early but I'm kind of confused
19:05
considering like I mean a whole bunch of people are about to get a alert to their phone that something is done that in
19:12
their minds hasn't even started but yeah yeah it was I mean at this site right
19:18
now like when you got that push alert the representative for Donald Trump was speaking like people were still hearing
19:24
the argument for Trump yeah yeah but I mean it's all across the time's already published that
19:32
story um so clearly there is a level of confidence that across the state hey
19:39
that only further shows that this is really only a question about second and
19:46
who would kind of go forward if Donald Trump wins the Iowa caucus is by a big margin I think in the same way that this
19:53
has usually been a state that like presents a multitude of options it's going to be a state that really kicks
19:58
off with is now looking like a just a formal
20:04
[Music] coronation there was so much buildup to the Iowa Republican caucus only for it
20:10
essentially to be over before some Iowans even cast their votes that felt
20:15
like a fitting ending to this particular contest Trump broke all of Iowa's
20:21
supposed rules he skipped the debates did far less traditional campaigning and
20:26
didn't cater to the state's Evangelical leader on issues like abortion but still in the state that was
20:32
supposed to be a springboard for his Rivals no one could come
20:38
close later on caucus night V ramaswami the right-wing businessman who plays
20:44
fourth in the Caucasus announced that he was suspending his campaign and would be endorsing
20:49
Trump Trump's good night had gotten even better and the idea that this Republican
20:55
primary could be a March to the inevitable had never seen more true that is unless New Hampshire does
21:03
something [Music] weird that's after the
21:20
break for the past month the biggest political storyline in the Republican primary has been Nikki Haley's rise in
21:27
New Hampshire where she was starting the poll pretty close to Donald Trump but if
21:32
anyone had a bad night in Iowa it was probably her considering she finished third to Ronda
21:39
Sanz so I wanted to get a sense of how Iowa could affect New Hampshire and
21:44
whether Donald Trump's dominance or Haley's slight disappointment were Shifting the
21:49
landscape to do that hey I'm glad we're able to do this how are you doing yeah
21:55
oh you know holding it down I called my colleague Nick corsen who's been focusing his coverage on the New
22:00
Hampshire primary and has been there all week so Nick I know you had a late night at the Trump event New Hamshire last
22:06
night what was the energy there like just generally paid the scene of well that here was a cold night in New Hampshire though I mean considering I
22:13
just survived negative 30 something I can't I I I'm not I'm not feeling too bad for the cold this there yeah I mean
22:20
cold is relative right we were in the baly mid 20s in uh Southeastern New
22:25
Hampshire but there was a ton of sleep ice there was probably about 8 in of snow on the ground um you know when I
22:32
arrived I was about 2 and 1/2 hours early before Trump's scheduled start time and there was already a line of
22:38
about 300 people waiting in this wet and frozen parking lot snaking down um 2 and
22:44
a half hours early two and a half hours early and there was like this kind of palpable excitement there's always these
22:50
lines of trump events I mean I've been going to these you know since 2015 and there is the excited many who come and
22:56
and wait in line and it almost becomes a little bit of its own tailgate but there was even more excitement yesterday I
23:02
think because everyone was still very excited about the Iowa Victory and you could feel that as soon as you walked in
23:08
the room there was a buzz like yeah we just won like I feel great um he's going to win it gave us you know the signal
23:14
that we needed that this is off to you know the march to the nomination and I'd be talking to voters and I'd be like you
23:20
know how long do you wait outside and they'd say n two hours but it was worth it every single one of them had to
23:25
qualify that like the line was worth it I think that's really interesting because to your point as we have talked to people who have seen Trump on the
23:31
road over the last 6 months they have mentioned the kind of lack of energy that has become associated with his
23:37
rallies say in 2016 or 2020 that maybe there was like a more sleepy nature to
23:42
this version of the Trump campaign but it does sound like at least winning in
23:48
Iowa or making the polling lead more clear and tangible as Monday did seem to
23:54
have energized some folks at least of the place you were yesterday yeah absolutely and I think it gave them
24:00
confidence right like Iowa was always a foregone conclusion it was just a question of how big was the victory were
24:06
going to be and you know him being over 50% 30 points higher than the santis and Haley I think gave a lot of Voters here
24:13
that extra confidence that like he can win in New Hampshire CU it had been somewhat of an open question I mean you
24:19
know he certainly is leading here in every single poll nothing has showed him not leading and his lead over Nikki
24:26
Haley has always been well outside the margin of error but there was that slim narrow path that showed Haley had a
24:34
possibility of winning here yet everyone I talked to at the event yesterday had
24:39
no doubts that Trump would win New Hampshire and win easily and when I'd ask why one of the main reasons that we
24:45
point to was like well just look at last night so as you mentioned this is a big state for Nikki Haley the campaign has
24:51
put a lot of attention on to New Hampshire and even after the Iowa vers in Her speech that night she made very
24:58
clear that she still sees this as a two-person race and that New Hampshire would really prove that I guess my question is like Nikki Haley's case in
25:04
New Hampshire has a lot to do with her appeal to Independence in the state can you describe what the New Hampshire
25:10
independent looks like or sounds like what their priorities are because how should I think of New Hampshire
25:15
Independence as different than your classic swing voter or moderate I think what's unique about New Hampshire's
25:22
independent voters which are technically Undeclared they're just unaffiliated so then they can register on the same is
25:28
the primary to whichever they want to participate in is that they really stretch across a broad swath of the
25:34
political Spectrum you have some who are going to be real Libertarians some who are going to actually be big Trump
25:41
supporters who just never felt a part of the Republican party or any party but are drawn to Trump and what Trump has
25:48
turned the party into there's a lot that are pretty moderate um that again don't
25:54
feel ties to either party they tend to be you know much more on the libertarian side but not necessarily so far that
26:01
they support someone like aan Paul or Trump um and there's some who are also
26:07
you know kind of democratic leaning and they normally would vote for a democrat in a general election but in a
26:13
20124 primary where there's only a Republican primary they want their vote to count so they'll participate in the
26:20
Republican primary so it really is this kind of undefinable sum um that makes up
26:26
the majority of Voters and I think that's also what creates the uncertainty that is you know kind of overshadowing
26:33
the New Hampshire primary whereas Iowa was you know a foregone conclusion before voters even cast their votes yeah
26:39
I remember Haley saying in New Hampshire that she could see that state correcting Iowa's result which actually got her a
26:46
lot of stick in Iowa D santis even made a whole negative ad about it but it does imply that the state really marches to a
26:51
beat of its own drum rather than necessarily follow what went before it you know you mentioned that people were
26:57
mentioning Iowa's result at the Trump rally that you were just at but I guess I'm thinking more broadly should we
27:04
think of New Hampshire as some place that will cut Against the Grain or is it
27:09
that you know the same levels the same momentum we're seeing come from Monday you expect to continue come next Tuesday
27:15
in their primary so New Hampshire has a has a long history of really just going
27:21
against Iowa right it's not since uh 1976 that um a republican in an open
27:27
comp comptitive primary has won both Iowa and New Hampshire which you know president Trump is is trying to do this
27:33
time wait I actually I didn't know that fact since 1976 no one has won an open competitive primary both Iowa and New
27:39
Hampshire on the Republican side yes interesting so this has the potential to be that first time um now New Hampshire
27:48
also has a long history of delivering surprise results but they don't always pretend to March to the nomination right
27:55
like if you look at 1992 bill Bill Clinton has a big surge in New Hampshire and that's what kind of sets him off to
28:00
eventually getting the nomination and he points back to New Hampshire you know as what did it for him in 2000 isn't that
28:07
the comeback kid thing that's the comeback kid you know there's a a whole era of politics that was kind of sparked
28:13
by New Hampshire though yeah if you go to 2000 uh Senator John McCain had a
28:19
surprise Victory here and it looked like oh maybe you know George W bush who is the front runner isn't going to walk
28:25
away with this thing and then sure enough he did and that just proved to be a little blip so it could certainly go
28:31
one of two ways but New Hampshire certainly has a history of delivering surprising results and again a lot of
28:37
that could be due to the large swath of Undeclared voters those Independence is where you know the the question of the
28:44
final results really really come in mhm it kind of changes the calculus for the candidates in campaigns and you have to
28:51
kind of win some Independence to really have a shot at finishing at the top of the Heap and while Trump has some of
28:56
those people and we should not just think of independent and moderate as necessarily the same thing Nikki Haley
29:01
strategy is much more dependent on turning those people into her voters she's targeting them maybe even more
29:08
than Trump who feels better about his position with regular Republicans is that true yeah I I've spoken to a lot of
29:14
Veteran New Hampshire Republican operatives who have said that this is shaping up to be almost a fight between
29:20
the registered Republicans here and then the larger sect of independent voters um
29:25
registered Republicans seem to be the majority with former president Trump and The Independents are probably the
29:30
majority with Nikki Haley especially when we look at polling but you know where that kind of middle slice breaks
29:37
is I think where the where the battle is and Haley is aggressively courting those as are you know her allies like Americans for Prosperity action they've
29:44
been out knocking doors on unaffiliated voters who you know would be considered likely to vote in the Republican primary
29:51
and their independent polling also shows that once this becomes a quote unquote twers race in New Hampshire it Titans
29:58
and more of those Independents do break towards Nikki Haley their most recent polling which is in December found that
30:05
if it was a full field Haley was losing to Trump but if it was just Haley and Trump then she was within the margin of
30:12
error so that shows how much you know those independent voters could also be breaking late it's not a one-on-one matchup
30:19
though that's my first thought when I hear that is that she does still have this kind of uh the the annoyance that
30:26
is the Ronda santis camp cign that is still sticking around and finished ahead of her in Iowa um is there any
30:33
difficulty for Haley to really consolidate this and present it as a one-on-one matchup considering she did
30:39
have a somewhat disappointing result in Iowa which placed her third behind Ronda santz sure there's actually two I guess
30:47
um you know annoyances or things that might be blocking that two person race from exactly happening the first is as
30:53
you mentioned uh Governor D santis who finished head over in Iowa and while he
30:58
hasn't necessarily put a lot of effort into New Hampshire at least the same way he did Iowa right he moved his
31:04
headquarters to Iowa he put his staff in Iowa he hasn't done that in New Hampshire he certainly campaigned here plenty and so when you you know look at
31:12
what that has in the polls he's been in the mid to high single digits now that's certainly enough to eat into a Haley um
31:18
lead but also you don't know if those voters necessarily break towards Haley the bigger impediment for her was former
31:25
Governor Chris Christie and was he when he was in the race he was polling you know 15 about maybe 12 um and he was
31:33
definitely taking some of her supporters away now internal polling that I've gotten from the chrisy campaign showed
31:40
that the majority of their voters would go to Haley if Christy got out which he did you know last week but that's not
31:47
all of them there's actually shockingly a small slice of Christy voters that will go to Trump which even the Christie
31:52
campaign was pretty surprised by yeah I wonder you know you know it's one of
31:58
those facts where I'm like I need to see that person and look them in their eyes you know like what is what would be the
32:03
thing that causes you to go for the like Trump is killing democracy guy and then go to the killing democracy guy in
32:10
Christy's language yeah it's I mean those are the voters that if you find It's the Most Fascinating interview and
32:15
you know we I hope to find them at the Trump rally uh tonight in Portsmith yeah but within that Christy polling they
32:22
also found a decent number not a majority but a decent number of their supporters who were undecided once he
32:27
got out and some of them may eventually break for Haley though not enthusiastically because it' be an
32:33
anti-trump vote and then some of them might just stay home CU they found as christe has said on the stump and
32:39
Christy advisers have told me about they view both Haley and asantis as not
32:45
fervently enough anti-trump you know they've said they would pardon him or even Haley said she wouldn't turn down
32:51
the opportunity of being his vice president and that has turned off some of those Christy supporters so as
32:57
Christy strategist has told me it's a fallacy to just stack Christy's number on top of Haley's and then show like oh
33:03
look she's tied with Trump right now cuz that just won't happen you know you covered Chris Christie for years and that was someone who kind of had the
33:09
most cleare eyed anti-trump message in this race that got some Traction in New Hampshire but not really enough and
33:16
didn't actually sustain him to be able obviously to continue his campaign through the New Hampshire primary but
33:21
you've seen that kind of anti-trump messaging in the Republican party up close like why don't do you think the
33:27
Christies of the world were able to make significant traction with that message well I think it's for exactly
33:34
you know what we saw in Iowa and what we've seen in all these polls is that the the base of the Republican party is
33:40
still so strongly with Trump that such you know virulent criticism striding
33:45
criticism that would come from uh Governor Christie just immediately turned them off and there wasn't even
33:51
enough of margins of Republican of the Republican base that was available for
33:57
Christie to win over with his arguments now New Hampshire presented him that opportunity to win over The Independents
34:03
to win over the moderates who do want to move on from Trump and you know when I spoke to chrisy um you know back in the
34:11
fall here and anytime I saw him around the state he would say hey if I win here
34:16
then that changes everything you know it gives a lot of people are saying that exactly they believe that like a victory
34:23
here gives if I 65 I'd be in the NBA you know like we would all be living
34:29
different lives yeah yeah exactly um and they believe that you know it gives voters permission to break from Trump
34:36
but as we've seen a lot of Republican voters aren't looking for that permission they're they're with Trump so
34:42
when you think about the early States how would you describe the difference between a New Hampshire voter and an Iowa
34:48
voter well everyone makes a lot of the Iowa nice voter right they're taken back
34:53
by how warm and friendly they are and willing to talk to everyone and new New Hampshire has what I call like they
34:59
really are this Live Free or Die libertarian streak they're certainly willing to talk to you you know they're
35:05
as engaged a voter as you find in Iowa because they get the same kind of access to candidates so they get the same
35:10
familiarity with the media but their responses can be blunter uh can be much
35:16
more direct um they're definitely very different right they're not necessarily like evangelicals or Christians you get
35:23
um a lot more in your face there's a lot of unprint profanity that I'll get sometimes that I have to you know work
35:30
around um as I got yesterday with a lot of very amped up and excited voters um you know pumped after the io Victory I
35:37
think they were letting their uh language slip a little bit uh and they're proud of that you know kind of live Freer di mentality that that
35:44
governs New Hampshire politics and it speaks to the kind of issues that they want to talk about like every voter I
35:49
talked to yesterday did not not a single one brought up abortion everyone brought up the economy that was humming under
35:57
former president Trump and multiple voters used that word either humming or motoring that was like what they heard
36:03
and that's what they felt they were economic voters taxation voters proun voters um not any of those kind of
36:09
Evangelical issues that we heard in Iowa you know it does lend itself to is
36:14
if you can win among the Evangelical base in Iowa and win among a more libertarian proun Second Amendment based
36:21
in New Hampshire I mean that's it that's the Republican Party you know like at some point at
36:28
some point the other candidates have to deal with that yeah it's a pretty broad Coalition that doesn't offer many cracks
36:34
to you know be able to win over a majority of Voters and I guess we we'll really see whether Trump's able to
36:40
stitch together that Coalition here in New Hampshire with those Undeclared voters here thank you so much for your
36:47
time Nick I really appreciate it oh thanks for having
36:55
me that's the run up for Thursday January 18th 2024 now the rundown and I think it's
37:03
very clear who the Republican primary electorate is saying that they want to be their nominee on Tuesday Morning
37:09
Fresh off his exit from the race V ramaswami landed in New Hampshire to
37:14
join Donald Trump on the trail and during an appearance on Fox News he called on other candidates to step aside
37:22
you're calling on Nikki Haley and Ronda Sanz to drop out right now
37:28
I am and I do think that would be healthy for this country and I think that you know what especially Rona santis at least of the two of them will
37:33
have an important role to play in the future of this country and leading this nation I do believe that but I think
37:38
that the right thing Ronda santis is still pressing on by Tuesday Morning the Florida governor had arrived in South
37:44
Carolina signaling that his new political aim is to beat Haley in her home
37:50
state Nikki Haley meantime is courting New Hampshire's independent voters her
37:56
best shot at coming out ahead of trump also on Tuesday the last anti-trump
38:01
voice in the race former Arkansas governor ASA Hutchinson suspended his long shot campaign for president leaving
38:09
only three candidates competing for New Hampshire as it stands 20 presidential
38:15
delegates have been pledged to Donald Trump D santis has nine and Haley eight
38:20
to clinch the nomination candidates need to win a majority of the party's overall delegates which amounts to
38:28
1,215 there are 292 days until the general election we'll see you back here on
