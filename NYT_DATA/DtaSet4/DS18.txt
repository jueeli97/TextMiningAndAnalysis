Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Entering the 2024 Election


0:02
for months now I've been reluctant to talk about third parties that's not because of Any
0:08
individual candidates but that it's hard to know what type of impact they could have in November especially at this
0:14
early stage but this week some news caught my attention the Democratic National
0:21
Committee has just formed a unit to specifically push back against third party and independent candidates and it
0:28
comes at the same time some Biden allies formed a super pack called Clear Choice
0:34
that plans to do the same meaning clearly team Biden is worried about the
0:39
potential impact of Outsider candidates and one candidate in particular is likely the primary cause
0:45
of concern Robert F Kennedy Jr he's polling above 10% in National
0:52
surveys his team says he's already secured ballot access in key States like Nevada and New Hampshire and of course
1:01
he's a Kennedy but for as much as RFK JR could matter in
1:07
November very little is known about him at this point besides his famous name in
1:13
his history of spreading conspiratorial claims about covid vaccines and the
1:19
political system as a whole so after exploring the two major candidates and
1:24
how Democratic and Republican leadership helped create the conditions for Biden versus Trump
1:30
again I wanted to talk to the person who's crashing the rematch party and
1:35
positioning himself as a potential spoiler for them both today an interview with Robert F
1:43
Kennedy Jr from The New York Times I'm estad hearnen this is the
1:50
[Music] runup hello can you hear
1:56
me hey is that it's Bobby Kennedy Hi how are you you thank you so much for joining us I appreciate your
2:02
time yeah thanks for thanks for doing this I I wonder if you allow me to ask
2:09
what is your what what kind of name is that is that Ethiopian or no it's actually like
2:17
a family name my dad's name is aead his uncle's name is aead and I the next one of us wow all
2:25
right you know I too have the same name as my dad even though you know I think our are uh the the pressure of that's a
2:31
little different I talked with RFK Jr earlier
2:37
this week with this press team in the background I want to dive into this kind of Life of relationships and the kind of
2:44
scope and worldview kind of where that came from so have you always been a Democrat it might be an obvious question
2:50
yes I grew up in the Democratic party and was that an identification because of your family's history what did the
2:56
word Democrat even mean to you as you were growing up uh the word Democrat means the party of of the Constitution
3:04
the particularly press freedom and and other religious freedoms Etc when I in
3:10
the world I grew up in the Democrats were the Protectors of the Constitution the
3:15
Republicans uh often put Law and Order and National Security in front of the Constitution um it was the party of
3:24
working people of the middle class the Republican party in contrast was the party of Wall Street it was the party of
3:30
Free Speech it was the anti-war party it was the party that was worried about the
3:36
domination of America's democracy by excessive corporate power it was the
3:43
party of the environment you know it was the party of Freedom essentially of personal
3:49
freedoms you know it was also the party of your family I mean I I can't be here and not ask the obvious question that
3:56
I'm sure you've gotten so many times but you know at the age of n your uncle was killed where do you remember about that
4:03
time and what effect did it have on you and how you viewed the political system or political space in
4:09
general yeah I mean you know my uncle was kind of the son that that provided
4:14
the gravity that was the center of you know the orbit of all of our orbits
4:19
growing up my father had there were a total of nine siblings the the the
4:25
children of Joseph and Rose Kennedy and we grew up you know with this kind of
4:31
notion that our lives would be consumed by some great debate and that um and
4:38
that it would be a great privilege for us to be involved in some meaningful way
4:44
in those disputes and then uh when my uncle died
4:50
I was you know of course it was uh it was shattering for our whole
4:56
family um I was at school that day had said well friends and my mom picked me
5:01
up early from school and I could already see that that the St the flags in
5:07
Washington DC on her way home were at half staff and I asked her about that and she said a bad but you didn't know
5:13
why I didn't know at that time and then she said a bad man shot Uncle Jack and when I got
5:20
home my father was walking in the yard with John mome who was the head of the
5:26
CIA he came to our home every day during the Springtime and summer to go swimming in our pool after work and he would
5:34
often come over for lunch and eat lunch with my mom or dad so I knew him well and he was walking with my father in in
5:41
the yard when I got home my father actually during that conversation had asked
5:47
mome whether the CIA had been the authors of his brother's
5:52
shooting um and and we hugged my dad my and and you know that was kind of the
5:58
beginning of a a long long morning period mhm mhm you know you were 14 when
6:03
your father was killed at the time did you see their deaths as connected to their political message and the work
6:08
they were doing I saw their deaths as a risk of
6:14
politics okay and you know I to me I I feel like I I saw Politics the way that
6:22
you'd see going to war that this was a risk and that you know it was
6:28
something that took some courage to do and that you know it was part of the
6:33
cause of maintaining a democracy and you know but there was also a risk involved
6:39
and I you know I'm sure that I that that my uncle's death um what influence that belief
6:49
system but you you that's a I mean that's a kind of Zen view to take as a 14-year-old who had experienced such
6:55
personal you say at the time you thought that this was just a a kind of function of Public
7:01
Service yes I did and you know I I think my mom and my family were really
7:08
Shattered by the death but they also um they wouldn't allow self-pity in
7:14
our house or victimization you know those were require regarded as destructive
7:21
impulses and that and selfish impulses my mother I remember her saying you know everybody takes their licks and their
7:29
kids in Harlem their kids in Compton their kids in bedy who have lost their dads who you
7:37
know Dad's been shot and um and they don't have what you had which a strong
7:43
family strong religious belief um good education uh wealth and
7:49
and plenty of potential and you know there was my grandfather kind of set the
7:54
standard that people don't don't don't whine and about
8:00
that you kind you you accept what happens and and try to embrace it you know I've read a lot of details of your
8:06
life after that I read that you were kicked out of school twice you were arrested you were sworn in as a Ada in
8:12
Manhattan but then had to resign because you didn't pass the bar how did you go from that story and land at
8:19
environmental activism take me through the Journey that you know I see like a a
8:25
way worthy teenager era but it also seems like it landed in an impassion activist specifically in finding the
8:31
cause of the environment how did that happen well I I would say I mean I
8:36
became a heroin addict pretty soon after my dad's death I was a heroin addict
8:41
from the age of 15 I think after my dad's death I felt a pressure to um to
8:47
pick up the torch and and uh and I ended up kind of following a little more in his footsteps I went to you know Harvard
8:54
I went to the University of Virginia law school which he had done I became became a DA uh you know
9:01
which was kind of a parallel to what my dad was had done um but you know I I was doing
9:08
things that were not appealing to my soul I was doing them out of sense of
9:13
obligation or some other sense that was that it was not right for
9:19
me and when I got sober at the age of 28 you know one of the important things
9:24
about sobriety is to try to be true to yourself and I knew that I wanted to work on the environment you know when I
9:30
was a little kid I said I wanted to be a vet or a scientist I was you know I I
9:36
was in the I I love the outdoors I had homing pigeons that I was Raising and
9:41
and breeding from when I was 7 years old I started training Hawks when I was nine and you know became obsessed with with
9:50
falconry and had Hawks my entire life after that um and so when I when I got
9:56
sober and started reorganizing my life I wanted to work with people who were
10:01
working in the environment people who were up to their waste in mud and and
10:07
water and waiters and so it was very very comfortable to me to work for
10:12
fishermen and I began suing polluters for the fishermen on the Hudson River and you know I felt like I was being
10:19
effective at doing something that I loved yeah yeah I mean that I've listened to other interviews where you
10:25
explained this and I think this really comes through and I think it gets us to a portion we can talk more more about how this informs a belief set and how
10:32
you start to use your public voice in this time this is when you start using your voice specifically in the Public
10:38
Health Arena and you're expressing the skepticism against vaccines there is a now notorious retracted article in Salon
10:45
that repeated the kind of I would say heavily debunk theory that vaccines cause autism in children I want to say I
10:51
don't want to really fight about the science here because in my opinion that's something that you know is settled or folks can look up I guess I
10:57
just wanted to ask you more broadly about the choice to use your voice for that issue it does seem like around this
11:03
time you go from being RFK junr Environmental Lawyer fighting against corporate influence to using your voice
11:09
for suppling other things in the public on I guess I'm asking with your voice and with your name how did you think
11:16
about your own personal responsibility and lending that to these causes like
11:22
even if you believe them privately what about the choice to do so publicly well you know I mean the way
11:28
that I got into this was kicking and screaming it wasn't something that I wanted to do in
11:34
2003 FDA and the National Academy of Science has published a study that found that every freshwater fish in America
11:41
had dangerous levels of mercury in its flesh and the water Keepers by then the
11:46
water keeper movement which I had co-founded was the biggest water protection movement in the world we had
11:52
350 waterers on waterways in 46 countries and a lot of them began suing
12:01
the coal burning power plants and cement KES for discharging Mercury which was
12:06
then getting in the fish and I was giving speeches public speeches all over the United States and
12:13
Canada and these women started showing up at almost all my speeches different
12:18
groups they'd always do the same thing they'd come early occupy the front rows and then afterwards they'd asked to
12:26
speak to me and they were as it turns out they were the mothers of kid of of
12:31
kids with intellectual disabilities and they all believe that their children have been
12:37
injured by vaccines and particularly Mercury and vaccines and um and so I started talking
12:44
to him and I said I didn't want to talk about the science but that's where this ended up going so first we found no
12:52
evidence of a study finding dangerous levels of mercury and all freshwater fish in the United States even though
12:58
it's true that nearly all fish contain at least some traces of mercury and second as for this very debunk
13:06
conspiracy that mercury in childhood vaccines causes autism here's the situation Mercury is a dangerous heavy
13:13
metal a specific less harmful type of mercury used to be used in some childhood vaccines but there's no link
13:21
between the Mercury and vaccines and autism and it was taken out of childhood vaccines in
13:27
2001 still the theory continues that the government the CDC and the FDA knowingly
13:35
let parents harm children this way all in the name of profit for big Pharma which is what really angers
13:42
Kennedy so um you know I was looking at just this Mass poisoning of children
13:48
that nobody was acknowledging and nobody really had the capacity to confront and
13:53
any scientist or Doctor Who came out and spoke about it was censored pun
13:59
DEC made Pariah and that kind of left me as the only one who could actually stand up and
14:08
you know help these kids and these parents so I felt like an obligation to it was not something that I chose or I
14:14
wanted to do if you knew about RFK Jr before he ran for president it was
14:19
probably because of this advocacy and it's not just vaccines and autism it's
14:25
conspiracies about 5G Wireless and Wi-Fi that they can into your body and cause
14:30
cancer it's election denial long before Trump turned that conspiracy
14:36
mainstream this is a man whose life has been defined by mistrust do you see any
14:41
connection between your beliefs you know that you know the government has not been fully honest with its citizens on a
14:47
bunch of issues and the personal tragedies that you experience as a kid it's hard to ignore the fact that your
14:53
uncle and Father's death were the basis of some very big kind of American formative uh uh beliefs about you know
15:01
the government not being honest or or you know what's been now brandished as sort of conspiracy or conspiracy theory
15:07
well I guess I'm considering like for you as someone who has lived this do you see a connection between having been
15:14
experienced um some of the things you did Growing Up and kind of where you've landed on where the government is in
15:20
terms of just as an instrument to be trusted or not well there might be but you know my
15:26
skepticism about government authorities I think was really melded during my years as an environmental uh attorney
15:34
okay and my you know my my attitudes about my uncle's death my father's death
15:41
I never questioned those worod doxies until quite late in life so you know I
15:47
just accepted like you do you know the New York Times version of things that
15:52
there was you know there was a single gunman which now the New York Times flip-flopping on and then you know
15:59
as the information began to come out and the documents because of the JFK act and
16:05
people made confessions and the when I started reading the books and uh you
16:10
know the scholarship on it my attitude about that Chang and I I'm happy to talk
16:16
to anybody about the details of that you know of of what made my attitude change and if you can tell me something that
16:23
shows that I'm wrong then I will no I I I I mean I don't have a formed opinion
16:29
oh I guess I'm saying you know I I'll tell you EST I think what you you say is right
16:35
that these were formative yeah that's what I was asking about it was and and
16:40
um you know most Americans do not believe on that the official story about
16:47
what happened to my uncle when the church committee actually went back and looked at these and Gary Hart and you
16:54
know all these Senators when the house assassination committee and the select committee on his destination went back
16:59
and looked at much more voluminous data they came to the official
17:05
conclusion you can read it in the Congressional Record that my uncle was killed by a conspiracy oh yeah it's a conspiracy
17:12
theory but you know the United States Congress and Senate believes it and you know I'm told I'm a conspiracy
17:19
theorist for you know because I believe that Cate causes non hodkin and foma but
17:25
I was able to help convince juries that it does and you know I also was called
17:31
by the New York Times a conspiracy theory cuz I said the covid vaccines would not prevent
17:37
transmission as I said there's no scientific basis for imposing social
17:42
distancing or mass and now the New York Times admits those things so you know you call them conspiracy theorists until
17:50
they're they're proven true for the record he's mostly right
17:58
the house committee did did reach the conclusion that President Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of
18:04
conspiracy the senate committee was more ambiguous They concluded that the investigation into the assassination was
18:11
quote deficient but said they had not found evidence of a conspiracy and the New York Times
18:18
continues to cite experts who say that masking and social distancing can help keep people safe from
18:24
Co but as with all conspiracies the power isn't in the factual basis but the feeling it adds up
18:33
to that the government can't be trusted and skepticism is
18:39
required after the break RFK Jr on his [Music]
18:55
campaign so for years and particularly before his antivaccine pivot RFK Jr was
19:01
rumored as a possible candidate for elected office but it wasn't until last year when he formally announced his
19:08
intentions to run for president that he officially joined the family business and followed in his Father's
19:15
Footsteps initially RFK Jr ran as a Democrat seeking to challenge President
19:21
Biden in the primary but last October he announced he would drop out of the Democratic primary
19:27
and run as an indep dependent candidate positioning himself as a potential spoiler that word spoiler now hangs over
19:36
everything regarding Kennedy and his campaign personally as the host of this show I've been avoiding the topic of
19:42
third party candidates partially because history is is really jumbled on how to think about them in November obviously a
19:49
third party candidate hasn't won uh but this year seems uniquely suited to a kind of idea of an outsider due to how
19:55
many people are disillusioned with the race or have said to be interested in candidates outside of trump or Biden how
20:01
would you think about the RFK Jun campaign what's the point of it who's its audience early in my life I was sort
20:09
of dabbled in politics and there was a couple of times when I came close to
20:15
running I came close to running when Hillary would that would have been
20:20
around 2000 when uh Hillary won ran for
20:26
my dad's seat and I was actually considering running and but I had family
20:32
issues that made it so there wouldn't have been a good judgment and then when
20:37
Obama won and she was appointed secretary of state that of course was very tempting
20:43
to me because it was a it was something that never happens with a free senate seat I had the same family issues that I
20:51
was still struggling with and um that led me to believe I should not do that and then after that I
20:58
put a side any thought of every running for political office again so I was very
21:03
content with what I was doing and it wasn't until Co when I saw the nation
21:09
really making these very strange choices and taking these very disturb
21:14
troubling directions both the Republican party but also the Democratic party the Democratic party losing touch with its
21:22
Traditional Values it's it's a horen for censorship it became instead the driver
21:28
behind this this you know the censorship of speech um you know particularly of
21:34
desent from or criticism of government policies which is exactly what you know the party had represented for so long
21:42
see you're saying co co was a break I mean I hear a kind of ton of ground covered in terms of your life and your
21:47
advocacy but in that moment you actually felt that there was a more call to direct political
21:54
accent yeah exactly and the first you know thought that sort of I I began
22:00
toying with is I you know I had a big enough following and I could raise
22:06
enough money that even if I didn't have a chance to win a presidential contest
22:12
that they would have to force me into the debates and I was frustrated because I hadn't been allowed to talk about any
22:17
of these issues I've in of wall toall censorship since 2014 beginning really
22:23
in 2005 and by 2014 it was total Eclipse I
22:29
couldn't publish a letter to the editor I you know nobody would allow me on to talk about
22:34
issues so you know if I ran I thought at least I'll be able to talk about these
22:40
issues and and confront them but um my uh my wife would have never let me
22:46
run if I wasn't going to win and um and it would have been a
22:52
hardship on my children and you know I could have ended up really being kind of a joke um and so so I um and then a
23:01
pollster Jeremy zogby uh contacted me by email and he
23:08
said I have some poll I've been polling your name and I need to show you these
23:14
polls and he came out to Los Angeles and he sat down with me and
23:19
Cheryl and he was getting these results that um were extraordinary given that I
23:26
had had nothing but bad publicity for almost a decade and yet my
23:32
popularity was better than anybody so at that point I started thinking I could actually win this anyway as the long
23:39
version of the long story no I appreciate I I wanted to hear the kind of story in full because I think it helps give me an understanding of the
23:45
arc that brought us to this point but it's unclear to me when you feel like the Democratic party kind of lost its way is it during that time when would
23:52
you site your own break with Democrats well I would say during that time I saw
23:59
a lot of disturbing things I saw you know the um the lockdowns businesses
24:04
shut down with no scientific citation no no notice and comment rule making no
24:10
environmental impact statement uh no due process none of the
24:16
safeguards of democracy that I've been litigating against government corporations for 40 years when they try
24:23
to skip the Democracy part of Regulation and here you just had one guy who one week says Mass don't work three weeks
24:31
later he's saying everybody put them on a week after that he's saying put on two and never gives a single Citation for
24:38
anything that he says and and yet everybody is saying we get this new thing that Democrats are saying which is
24:46
trust the experts well of course trust the experts is not a feature of democracy and it's not a feature of
24:52
science it's the opposite of democracy and science my father told me part of
24:58
the duties of living in a democracy is to maintain a posture of constant persist persistent and fears skepticism
25:06
towards public authorities and but you initially announced your presidential run as a Democrat before switching to
25:12
Independent why did you initially announce as a Democrat I why did you switch I I my idea was to try to recall
25:21
the Democratic party back to its initial values the values of Robert Kennedy John Kennedy FDR and if you went down list of
25:29
everything that they believed in and I would check every one of those
25:34
boxes but the Democratic party does not believe in those things anymore and I thought the best path for me was to to
25:41
run within the Democratic party try to summons sit back to its Traditional Values and then and then go ahead and
25:47
beat Donald Trump and by the way our polling was showing me if IR ran is a Democrat
25:54
decimating Donald Trump because I was getting a lot of Independence I was getting a lot of Republicans right but
26:01
the part but why did you switch from the Democratic primary to Independent I guess I still haven't heard answer that
26:06
because the Democratic party rigged the rules so that I could not win no as a as a primary candidate it
26:13
was polling was showing you having a real upheld battle against Bri among Democratic primary voters obviously
26:19
running as an independent ensures that you can pull from other groups and a and
26:25
to your point uh it has some inspired some fears of playing a spoiler from either Joe Biden or Donald Trump did you
26:31
do any polling as you switch from democratic run to an independent run trying to ascertain who you would pull
26:38
more votes from in the general election in November that was not the purpose of our
26:43
polling our polling that we did was to see if I could win and
26:50
um and the polling indicated that I could win as an independent you aren't concerned at all
26:56
about whether you would pull more votes from Biden or Trump my purpose is to win the
27:01
election are you committed to staying in the race through November is there any evid if there was any evidence that you
27:07
would help one candidate or another win would that cause you to drop out no no
27:12
do you have any personal fears even if you believe that you can win the election you don't have any personal fears about the possibility of playing a
27:19
spoiler to either Biden or Trump I have I have I have a fear about both of them
27:24
winning the election I guess I'm curious about that in your what are the stakes to this election what do you think happens if
27:30
Biden wins or if Trump wins you know I I see you know these two
27:36
presidents ran up the national debt higher than any president in history we now have a $ 34 trillion debt we're
27:44
spending more on the servicing our debt than our defense budget the chronic disease epidemic I don't think either of
27:50
these guys are going to do anything about it uh and you know president Trump said that he understood that that you
27:57
shouldn't lock down an entire society that it was crazy and yet and he knew it he said it then he caved into his
28:04
bureaucracy and let them roll over him so I don't think he you know I just I think both of these uh but it's scary
28:11
thinking about what could happen if either of these guys gets alerted it's interesting because a lot of what you're saying does not sound so dissimilar to
28:17
the conceit of the original Donald Trump presidency an outsider with a big name a willingness to tell it like it is not
28:23
beholding to systems of power the money that backs it I guess there's also what I think critics would say say is an
28:28
intention to use kind of conspiracy or maybe fear in the terms of bring it to the mainstream I guess how would you
28:34
respond to that do you see any similarities between what you're asking for voters to do and what Trump has
28:39
asked for voters to do in the past well I think both of us have a populist smash
28:44
message but you know populism can be either an instrument of idealism or it can be as
28:51
my father you know had a populist campaign in 1968 and then George Wallace had a populist campaign 1972 four years
28:59
later and one was a message of of darkness and the other was a message of
29:05
light I'm going to use my last couple minutes well I think I I hear what you believe in terms of the government's
29:10
failures during the pandemic I guess what's harder to understand about your candidacy is where it kind of stands on
29:16
the broader issues right you've gone back and forth on the National Abortion ban you've changed your opinion when it
29:21
comes to the southern border there's even less known about what you would do in a foreign conflict uh in terms of War
29:27
a war on Gaza or over in Ukraine I guess I'm asking like because of that should we see this candidacy as a protest Vote
29:34
or or considering your comfort with you know playing the role of spoiler how am I not supposed to see it as an a as a
29:40
spoiler campaign considering just the level of unknowns well there is a level of unnown
29:47
your your statement your synopsis of my record is just a disinformation campaign
29:54
is not accurate did you not go back and forth on the abortion ban no I'm I've
30:00
been consistent about abortion that women should have the right to choose and so and that's my position
30:06
listen if you want to know what my position is go to our website go to my interviews and watch them and I've been
30:12
very very consistent about that women should have a right to choose women should be in charge I've been I've been
30:19
a champion for medical freedom for bodily autonomy more than anybody in this country oh and I and I stick by
30:27
that people should go to our website Kennedy 24.com if they want to know what
30:32
my position or issues are I'm not flip-flopping on issues if I now listen if I learn something and I'm going to
30:40
change my position I think we want politicians to do that you know I learned something about the border from
30:46
doing two trips spending three days on one trip down there two days on another
30:52
and I saw what was happening the chaos the destruction the the humanitarian crisis
30:58
and yeah I changed my position on that because and I think that don't we want politicians who can respond in common
31:05
sense ways when new information comes in front of them I think we do you know my
31:11
last kind of point or question I I really do think that there in this conversation there's so many signs of
31:17
someone who has been navigating kind of difficult life circumstances in the public ey someone whose's name has
31:22
afforded them uh access and privilege to information also kind of insulated them from political consequences I'm still
31:28
stuck at you saying that you really haven't thought about whether you pull more from Biden or Trump or that's not
31:34
really a a a thought process of your Camp say I did not say I have not thought about it I mean you say you
31:40
didn't pull from it and that's not like a I pull of course why would I pull from that you know my intent was to see
31:46
whether I can win this race oh I gu well I ask well I ask again then specifically and by the way by the
31:53
way here's what the polling showing the polling is showing you know political did an an article on this hellsworth and
32:00
I am pulling I'm my strongest um supporters are Independents
32:07
so there are people who don't want to vote for Trump or Biden and I beat Trump and Biden among Independents so you know
32:13
in that sense I'm not pulling from either I'm also beating president Trump President
32:18
Biden among people under 35 nationally people under 45 in the in the battlegr
32:24
states there are people who probably would not vote for either Trump or Biden
32:30
they're going to vote because I'm in the race people want don't want to choose between the lesser of two evils they
32:35
want somebody they can believe in somebody that they faith in somebody that they like and my popularity is
32:41
greater than any political figure right now according to every poll and I guess I I guess that's not
32:48
the question I'm asking you though I'm you're asking me the question everybody asked me which is you know what every
32:54
every reporter ask are you with spoiler and I'm not you know listen I don't know who I'm going to pull from so we gave 10
33:00
extra minutes I totally understand can I ask this final question can I ask this question I just want to be understood as
33:06
long as I've understood and you answer it then we can totally get out of there that's I toally you know it's a it's a privilege to be
33:13
understood most people don't get that yeah I am yeah I'm asking for you to
33:18
understand okay um I am saying considering the long road of viability
33:23
that you have at a third party candidate even though you believe that you have have a good chance of winning there
33:29
there's a much higher likelihood that because of those structural barriers that your candidacy will is less likely
33:35
to be successful than biding or trumps I am saying considering that reality how
33:41
do you then think about your potential impact on this race is that a thing that you think about at all I think I'm GNA
33:48
have a good impact on this country and I you know listen everybody
33:54
that I've admired in history has I adire ired because they've they've gone
34:00
against conventional wisdom they've gone against you know sometimes their families sometimes their friends
34:06
sometimes their political parties their allies and they win and that's why I
34:12
admire them and I believe I'm going to win this race and in any case I'm going
34:17
to have a positive impact on this country because I'm going to get people to start questioning some of these orthodoxies that have been so
34:24
destructive to our health to our economy the political polarization and you know
34:30
I I'm bringing you know listen I'm I'm healing a divide here the
34:36
people so you know considering the reality of the stakes how would you respond to someone who says that someone
34:43
who has the name access and wealth that you do are insulated from a lot of the consequences of maybe some elections
34:50
that in the same way that you think you're acting on what you believe in that it requires a certain level of privilege to do so without thinking
34:57
about the possib of being a spoiler how would you respond you know I don't even know I really don't understand what your
35:03
question is I don't understand what your question is I listen I'm I'm running a
35:09
race I'm raising the money that I need I have an organization that we believe is better than any of the other political
35:16
organizations I'm surrounded by people who are motivated by very very pure
35:21
impulses because they love this country I'm offering a vision to Americans that
35:27
they're not not getting 70% of the people in this country do not want a contest between Trump and Biden don't
35:34
you feel that those people should have an option I mean or or isn't that kind
35:39
of a privilege position that you have of taking the position that the New York Times is not going to give th allow
35:46
those people to get those Americans who don't want to see a rerun of this contest don't you think they deserve
35:53
something or you going to sit there and say nobody should do that because I'm scared of this guy or I'm scared of that
36:00
guy the reason that we have pressured Democrats about the way that they set up Biden and about Republicans about the
36:05
way that they set up Trump is because of that very fact because of the fact that most Americans do not want these two options I guess I'm asking you a listen
36:12
the New York Times Democratic is essentially an instrument of the democratic party I understand you're making an Institutional argument I'm
36:18
asking I'm asking about the work that we do I'm posing a question to you you've been making institutional arguments
36:23
against me since this started you you're you are a you're a
36:30
instrument of the DNC and of course you're going to try to you know get people you you're your job as you know
36:38
doing what you're doing is to try to spin this some way that it's going to help Biden and hurt Trump and get rid of
36:45
any threat to you do you know to that that narrow guard in the guard rail
36:52
contest that the New York Times approves of and it's just not right for our country and I'm not going to go along
36:58
with it thank you so much yeah thank you all I appreciate your time and just so you
37:03
know like that's not what I'm here to do no every that's the question I was asking so we have like uh uh uh we're
37:08
going to be able to get this back to you we're planning to do this on Thursday um and we uh appreciate your time great
37:14
I'll work with Anna thank you so RFK Jr believes he's going to win
37:23
and his campaign is plowing ahead efforts to sec Ure ballot access in critical States like Wisconsin
37:30
Michigan and Pennsylvania are already underway and the campaign will soon unveil his choice for vice president
37:37
after floating names like Aaron roders the NFL quarterback who has also dabbled in conspiracy and Nicole Shanahan the
37:46
bay area lawyer and investor but the flashy VP pick or
37:51
getting on the ballot in all 50 states would not immediately take Kennedy from The Fringe to the mainstream
37:58
because while RFK JR says his message is one that calls back to a more populist version of the democratic party that's
38:05
not quite what I heard I heard a man completely convinced of his convictions
38:11
no matter how unfounded and I heard a candidate convinced of his own viability no matter
38:18
the evidence against it in other words the perfect recipe for
38:24
a spoiler [Music]
39:08
