The ‘People’s President’ vs. the Donor Class


0:03
uh first off reintroduce yourself for people who I have forgot my name is John Fredericks I'm a TV and radio talk show
0:08
host and more importantly the Godzilla of the truth I am the Godzilla of the truth I'm on in the morning 6:00 to 10
0:15
Eastern Monday to Friday you can catch me follow me on social media at JF radio show can you tell me where we are now
0:20
and where did we meet a year ago like at this time uh right now we're in nashwa New Hampshire as a result are pouring in
0:28
for uh Donald Trump up right now by 11 over Nikki Hy which is going to end the gangster bangster Wall Street hedge fund
0:36
open borders chap labor cabal they're on the edge tonight were working people
0:41
finally take their country back but where we met yeah was in Dana Point
0:47
California where the brain dead RNC leadership held their meeting last year
0:53
at a $700 a night PGE hotel when the RNC is broke and has no money on Tuesday as
1:01
polls were closing in the New Hampshire primary I was in nashwa at a watch party
1:06
held by the Trump campaign Maga hats were out in force
1:11
drinks flowed at the cash bar littered among the crowd were some notable characters in the prot Trump Universe
1:18
marrey Taylor green Rudy Giuliani Carrie Lake Byron Donalds B ramaswami and Tim
1:26
Scott and conservative talk show host and former runup guest John
1:32
Fredericks who i' had met last January when we were covering the Republican National committee's winter meetings
1:38
yeah yeah yeah at that time I remember so many of the Republicans there were saying that this race was going to be really competitive that Donald Trump
1:44
might even lose they were talking to people like Bron Atlantis other people getting in and I remember talking to you about how you felt that the party had
1:51
changed so much that it had to end with a kind of Maga movement candidate it had to end with Donald Trump Looking Back
1:58
Now how was the last year Dev veloped what surprised you ver say is this what you expected yes listen this is the
2:05
greatest movement the populous movement of working people in the history of the Republic and these donors on Wall Street
2:13
don't get it right they talk to the same circles of people they don't get out and talk to working people like I do every
2:20
day secretaries Shipyard workers people that punch a clock people with two jobs
2:26
trying to make a living and put food on the table they don't understand the party has changed and the populist
2:32
movement this is a working class party now white black Asian Hispanic it
2:37
doesn't matter if you work for a living and you are punching a clock and you're not part of the elite right you're
2:43
getting screwed and they know it your jobs are going away your wages are eroding your profit Shar is going down
2:51
your savings is getting obliterated with inflation you're getting wiped out they don't care illegals are overrunning your
2:57
country they're taking your jobs they're shipping in the China and the elites and the donor class and the Wall Street
3:03
gangster banksters who live for open borders and cheap labor just think they can buy this stuff and it's over we have
3:11
figured it out it's not the unions it's our movement right now Donald Trump is
3:16
the conduit for that post Trump there'll be someone else people say to me in 2028
3:23
who's going to be the nominee who's going to pick I'm like the nominee is going to be whoever the hell we say it
3:28
is because by that time we will have complete control of the party and so his VP pick is irrelevant to me we will
3:35
choose a nominee in 28 we will choose a nominee in 32 we will choose going forward because the populist movement is
3:43
on the verge tonight of obliterating the establishment unit party Elite and we're
3:50
weeks away from taking over the whole Republican party apparatus if not weeks
3:55
a year was there any moment in the last year when you thought Trump wouldn't be denominated no in your honest opinion no
4:02
there's no there no no you know what the only thing that stops him is his own health and you know I think right now he
4:09
looks more vibrant than ever so there was never a time and the persecution is back part and the reason I was going to say that Bron San says without the
4:16
indictments it would have been more real of a race what do you think about that R the Sanz is going to lose either way but
4:22
what the indictments did the persecution did is many people relate to that
4:28
because they've experience it themselves so many Americans have been persecuted they've been through this if you don't
4:35
have any money in this system you're screwed right it doesn't matter what your skin color is if you don't have any
4:42
money you cannot defend yourself you're at their Bay you're at their beck and call and so we're done with that working
4:49
people have one final opportunity and that's his movement and our conduit is Donald Trump Nick Hy's making the
4:56
argument that Donald Trump and poll after poll does worse than her against Joe Biden he's a drag on the ticket
5:02
pointing to the midterms how does Donald Trump win over those people who are skeptical of him in order for him to win
5:10
in November as I'm sure you won the alternative is Joe Biden the alternative is Raging inflation the alternative is
5:17
open borders overrunning your schools you can't go to the emergency room the alternative is turning things over to
5:23
China where they are stealing our steel our aluminum our jobs the alternative is
5:29
giving more of our money to Ukraine the alternative we talk to people even with that alternative they'll think about not
5:35
voting they'll think about voting third party because they find you know this version of Donald Trump to be a little
5:40
distasteful I'm saying does he have to do anything different or just he just has to be Trump right he's going to win
5:46
it's going to be a lance flight he's going to win the majority of these swing states he doesn't have to do anything different because he is the leader of a
5:53
movement this is not a personality cult like the uh left win media the state run media likes to say this is a movement by
6:01
Blue Collar working people and now it's seeped over to the lower professional class that's what's doing the in right
6:08
soon as we got their game set match right Trump is going to get over 20% of the black male vote why last time he got
6:15
what8 8% over over 20% because African-American men want jobs they want
6:21
security they want to be able to take care of their families and they see what's going on they've had enough when we talk to Democrats they say that Joe
6:28
Biden doesn't need to change anything because the contrast with Trump will make it so the people will back down I hear you saying the com a similar thing
6:34
you don't think Trump has to change anything because you'll take the contrast which we'll take we'll we'll let the electorate decide if it's a fair
6:40
election you have a fair election I'm going to put my chips on Donald Trump
6:46
winning the swing States and winning an electoral Landslide and saving America
6:52
and look need the Haley portion of the party the donors the kind of elite Republicans as you describ them don't
6:57
you need them for that win no no no they will never support us they loathe the
7:04
working person this isn't like something you can menend together like we had a fight at the Thanksgiving table they
7:10
hate us they loathe us we are just their tools go to work pay taxes have two
7:16
fingers of vodka have a Bud Light go home shut up and go back to work but there's more of us than them they got
7:23
the power they got the money guess what we have the people that's what this campaign is based on a working class
7:30
revolution of working middle class Americans who have had enough thank you so much I appreciate seeing you again
7:41
let Frederick is right just two states in the Grassroots base of the Republican
7:47
party has made their preference very clear but the establishment of the party
7:53
and in particular the donors continue to hold out hope for other options today
8:00
the bitter class war playing out within the Republican Party between the prot Trump base who's ready for the primary
8:07
to be over and the anti-trump donor class who thinks it's just getting
8:13
started from the New York Times in Manchester New Hampshire I'm estad
8:18
hearnen this is the
8:26
runup that's awesome call the after I talked to Frederick's words
8:32
started spreading through the room so the news just came in that Trump has officially won New Hampshire people are
8:40
um cheering and throwing Red Hats in the air in the end Trump finished about 11
8:48
points above Nikki Haley a sizable Victory but also a much closer race than
8:53
we saw last week in Iowa Haley's vote share here 43% in total was driven by
9:00
New Hampshire's High number of moderate Republicans and Undeclared Independence
9:05
who lined up behind her just as poll suggested they would after the call was made we saw
9:12
Haley come on TV to give a speech where she said the race was far from over and
9:17
she took some shots at Trump saying that Trump was the only Republican in the country who Joe Biden can
9:25
defeat meanwhile around 9:15 well I want to thank everybody this is a fantastic
9:32
State we watched this Trump himself took the stage you know we won New Hampshire
9:38
three times now three behind him were his son Eric his
9:45
campaign team notable endorsers like Marjorie Taylor green and his former
9:50
Challengers Tim Scott and vasami and today I have to tell you it
9:56
was very interesting because I said wow what a great Victory but then somebody ran up to the stage all dressed up
10:03
nicely immediately it he mocked haly and she was up and I said wow she's doing uh
10:10
like a speech like she won she didn't win she lost and you
10:16
know badly now I have here if he promises to do to do it in a minute or
10:21
less but the only person more Angry than let's say me but I don't get too angry I
10:27
get even he invited Ras Bia VI one minute or less go do it
10:35
VI what we saw tonight is America First defeating
10:41
America last that's what we saw his former rival understood the assignment using his time on stage to also attack
10:49
Haley who he targeted frequently throughout the GOP debates what we see right now with her continuing in this
10:55
race is the ugly underbelly of American politics where the mega donors are trying to do one thing when we the
11:01
people say another and it's up to us to We the People to at long last say hell no we the people create a government
11:08
that is accountable to us and we the people have said tonight we want again as we did in Iowa Donald J Trump and so
11:16
you want to actually speak truth that's the truth tonight and the only thing they're rooting for is an ugly thing
11:23
that we don't want to see happen that's what these people are rooting for is playing to say long enough so the read
11:29
Hoffman and the Ugly Democratic George Soros jors who are funding the lawsuits against Trump can prop up their puppet
11:36
we say no to that Vision I say the general election begins tonight and this man will win it in a landslide God bless
11:44
you Donald J Trump vote Trump
11:51
USA ramas Swami was making a point similar to John Frederick's that donors
11:56
and party Elites only want to stay in because they're seeking to overturn the
12:01
will of the people andas Swami is telling they're hoping to see Trump get locked up along the way Trump and his
12:09
supporters are confident that he can pull this off without moderate and independent
12:14
support and I wanted to keep pushing on that idea with a supporter at the party
12:19
who caught my attention you have a great kind of like Trump outfit are we recording now yeah yeah okay so tell me
12:25
tell me describe the outfit so I have my trump pin covering up the
12:31
Patagonia a label on my vest yeah you have your Trump sign and the Trump hat and the Trump hat which I just got
12:37
through Amazon you just got through yeah yeah cuz I wanted and you know been so cold I didn't know if I was going to
12:43
have to stand outside what made you want to come and be at the New Hampshire be here because I
12:49
wanted volunteers I wanted people associated with Team Trump to know that
12:57
there are more with him than he would ever imagine did you back Trump in the
13:03
2016 primary I did oh in the 2016 primary I voted for Ben Carson Carson but that's only because I knew I not I
13:09
don't know him but I just met him a few times and as a as a black woman I'm his fan girl but by the general election you
13:15
voted for oh absolutely yeah I I um and did you consider anyone else in this primary you consider santis or oh he is
13:22
awesome there's like 40% of Republicans who are maybe it's s Haley or or Ronda s
13:28
are clearly someone other than Donald Trump 40% I don't think so well I mean
13:33
both in this election both in the number of people who voted for other candidates Nowa both in Poland that we see I'm saying what does Donald Trump have to do
13:39
to bring those people back in the party like how can you unite around the party if he's you know mocking Haley and the
13:46
supporters up there don't all Republicans have to be your kind of around Trump for him to have a chance of winning how how do you make that
13:51
possible well I don't think that um it was Republicans who I don't think it's Republicans who are supporting Nikki
13:57
Haley I think it's Democrats this here we are in New Hampshire the people who
14:02
voted for Nikki Haley were the people they were allowed to vote as Democrats
14:08
and vote there were certainly some Democrats who reister party there's a lot of rep talk to them no I I talk to
14:14
people I'm I'm a member of I'm saying there are some Republicans who want other candidates I'm saying do you have to bring them in there are some but
14:21
there are not many there are some and there always going to be some you're always going to have Democrats where
14:27
there are Democrats who do not want I would I would say that's a different situation with Joe Biden most Democrats
14:32
do not want I'm saying but the donor class that is being insolve to here the the Haley supporters who are are
14:39
Republicans do does Donald Trump need those people the no he doesn't okay that's really what I'm asking no he
14:44
doesn't need those people cool well that answers my question yeah he yeah he doesn't he only needs the Grassroots the
14:50
donor class is not going to knock on doors the donor class is not going to make phone calls the donor class wants
14:56
to run campaign ads and say Donald Trump is a you know uh a crook or a this or
15:03
that or he's going to he's going to be convicted of what you know the donor class has the money to do
15:10
those things because for many of them they want open borders and we don't want
15:17
open borders so I see what you're saying like next year is not only a fight against Biden you seem to be describing a fight against them too absolutely yeah
15:24
the the GOP um I would say that the the old guard of
15:31
the GOP is having a very difficult time
15:36
because they want their party back they want the party back where the donor class makes all the decisions and we're
15:43
done with that well thank you so much I really appreciate your time after the break a member of that
15:51
donor class a billionaire who supports Nikki
15:57
Haley [Music]
16:09
on Tuesday night Trump and his supporters sought to frame this primary campaign as over and done with but more
16:17
than that they said that if Haley were to stay in the race as her campaign has promised to do that it would only be
16:24
because of the party's Elite donors who disdained the Grassroots base and their preference for Donald Trump so
16:31
the next morning after the results and the watch party I decided to call a
16:37
billionaire donor who was supporting Nikki Haley and asked should she stay in
16:42
the race and even beyond that how is he thinking about the M wing of the Republican party which was painting big
16:49
donors as undemocratic villains Hi estad how are you I'm doing
16:56
well how are you good you know I saw this uh movie last night about a swimmer
17:03
uh a woman who swims from Cuba to um Florida I was so inspired I got up this
17:11
morning at about 2 in the morning and I swam for about an hour oh wow that's
17:17
impressive did you swim that far I didn't swim from Cuba to you swim
17:23
from Cuba to Florida no I swim about a mile and a half hey that's more than
17:29
I've done this morning so uh shout out to you huh yeah no and so it was kind of a interesting fun way to you know after
17:36
one REM of sleep getting out there and doing that I thought it was kind of fun that is fun that is fun Tim Draper is a
17:44
venture capitalist who's invested in companies like Tesla Skype Hotmail
17:49
twitch and Robin Hood and he's given more than a million dollars to Haley's campaign and the outside groups that are
17:56
backing her I appreciate you taking some time out to chat with us today I mean I
18:02
um was really interested to kind of talk partially because you know I was at the Trump watch party in New Hampshire I've
18:08
been at Nikki Haley events all through the weekend and I wanted to talk to someone who has been supporting her
18:15
before we talk about the results I guess I would start with just saying like what caused you to back Nikki Haley and specifically what caused you to donate
18:21
your money to Nikki Haley yeah um I have been really impressed with her I think she has very
18:30
good character I think she is kind she is very thoughtful she sees all points
18:38
of view on uh things like pro-choice versus pro-life she understands uh
18:46
foreign policy which is I I travel a lot I go all over the world I have a a show
18:53
called meet the Drapers where where I interview entrepreneurs all over the world
18:58
and I've seen how important our foreign policy is and how we're represented
19:06
internationally and I like her attitude of I I support my friends I support
19:12
democracies I don't support dictatorships uh when I first met her I
19:18
just thought wow this woman is um strong and capable and at the time I think just
19:24
left being governor and just about to become ambassador un so you met her
19:29
before the presidential run yeah and then um I was impressed then and I I
19:35
read her book and I thought wow she's very thoughtful and politically Savvy uh she gets things done and you
19:43
see that she does it in an effective way where everybody comes out feeling good
19:48
and I think there's a a strong character there and she's tough and she's willing
19:55
to run for president I mean that for somebody that amazing to be willing to
20:01
run for president I think we were just lucky I I guess I would love to actually step back for a second I mean can you
20:07
tell me a little bit about yourself can you help me meet the Drapers I mean can you tell me about like how tell me about
20:14
your your business career and how you made money in the first place good yeah
20:20
so I I started out as an entrepreneur and I borrowed money from the US
20:26
government against um oh let me go way back my grandfather was
20:31
the first Silicon Valley venture capitalist my father was a venture capitalist I had venture capital in my
20:38
blood it was a tiny little industry at the time I got started and we raised
20:43
money from uh a couple of wealthy people that I was able to get in touch with it
20:49
was like I started with my friends and then I went outside my friends and to
20:55
their friends and then to their friends and eventually we got to rich people and so I raised a bunch of money I put that
21:02
to work that fund the next fund the next fund they all went incredibly well we
21:08
had the the internet boom I set up Venture funds globally um that did very
21:14
well so a lot of good bets I hear um no lots of bad bets and a few good ones
21:21
that's kind of the way our business works I'm curious how is investing in candidates different from investing in
21:27
Tech compan and you know how is the calculus is the thinking the same how does it come around how does the that
21:33
part of your brain translate to the political donor side of your brain you know the political donor side
21:40
of my brain is similar to the philanthropic side of my brain I look at
21:46
that as money for society to improve Society even though it's not tax
21:52
deductible or whatever it's money where I say our society needs this and I have
22:00
traveled around I've been able to meet the presidents of many countries around the world and I've noticed that the
22:07
presidents that trust their people and set them free build great economies
22:13
create great job opportunities great societies optimistic
22:19
people and the governments that are um control and command governments that um
22:27
run as sort of dictatorships really create a very depressed population they're afraid uh
22:34
they don't try new things they don't innovate they they just barely try to stay employed and their economies go
22:41
Flatline I do realize how important a leader can be and how it can get people
22:47
with jobs and get um people houses and get people just I mean an economy that
22:54
grows quickly can lift everybody up by its uh bootstraps so it seems like your
23:01
Calculus when it comes to political donations is more about kind of creating
23:06
a world you want to see a leader you want to see rather than it is uh maybe the more tactical how does this person
23:13
win how much do you think about viability when you're donating alongside those ideals oh uh you know I mean I I
23:21
wanted to make sure that she was very capable and she has proven herself by
23:27
winning every single debate to be very capable you know Trump's afraid to
23:32
debate her because she's so good um and uh and I think uh so she is
23:40
very viable um would I think about viability before backing a candidate yes
23:46
of course and would I think about what the world will look like if that candidate
23:52
becomes president yes I I know you mentioned winning the debates but I'm kind of thinking about like tal
23:58
viability here you know one of the things that we've reported on through this show is how you know Nikki Haley
24:04
has a difficult path to win the Republican nomination partially because the ways the party has changed in the
24:09
Donald Trump era when you are giving to her when you are backing her originally I guess I'm wondering kind of how were
24:15
you thinking about her path to victory in the primary considering Donald Trump
24:20
has changed the party to such a degree you know what funny I I I miscalculated
24:26
on one thing and that was that I didn't
24:31
realize that those Trump supporters just want retribution they're just angry and they
24:39
want retribution and they stopped listening and I was thinking oh my God a
24:44
trump Biden combination it would be ridiculous why we got so many great candidates out
24:52
there why would we ever want these two octogenarians to be you know our our two
24:58
candidates you thought everyone was kind of on the same page that there you wouldn't want the same thing again right
25:03
I didn't think anybody really wanted that but I think that there is so much
25:09
animosity built up and I don't know which side is right here I don't have a
25:15
a really strong feeling about you know whether you know the people who are
25:20
saying he was wronged or the people who are saying he's a felon are right I
25:26
don't know that'll come out in the court or whatever but I I did think you know he might have been a good candidate
25:32
eight years ago and I'm not so sure that makes any sense today I mean he's he's
25:38
stumbling on his words and he's um and he he mistook her for um for Pelosi and
25:46
I I thought you know that's that's kind of a that's a bigger Gaff than like the
25:52
obvious Gaff but his supporters are just so much after retribution
25:58
that I think they stopped listening and I think that they've
26:03
um I'm actually amazed that women are still supporting him I it sort of
26:09
baffles me yeah I mean that's kind of where I wanted to go I mean obviously there were high hopes for Nikki Haley in
26:14
New Hampshire specifically because it has so much more of the independent votes the moderate kind of Republican
26:19
voter I think about the results last night as I'm sure you watched would you say like is an 11-point loss there an
26:26
example of her traction or should we take the results from Iowa and New Hampshire as evidence that the majority
26:32
of the Republican base is sely behind Donald Trump no I think um you know she
26:38
had 2% of the vote when I started backing her and she is now at
26:43
43% of the vote uh she had 20% in Iowa
26:48
the trend is good it it's still he still pulls better than she does but I think
26:55
that that is changing I I know a lot of democratic women are changing party to
27:02
vote for Nikki Haley it takes time to get people to go from I I know it took
27:08
me a little time to change um from I was a declined to State uh in California
27:16
that's sort of the independent group and I moved to a republican uh and I had to
27:23
uh sign up it didn't take long it was an easy thing to do but it was one of those things like you got to get around to
27:29
doing I think the Democratic women are getting around to voting for Nikki Haley
27:36
because I know they're going to want to support her in the general election and now is the time to support
27:43
her so she gets into the general election so I so what I hear you're saying the trend line is such that you
27:49
still feel good about that investment in the Haley campaign and will you give
27:54
more money going forward should she stay in this race I know that's an open question that some people are trying to pressure her to get out what's your
28:00
message to that no no a lot happens in politics and she's down to just the two of them she
28:07
should definitely stay in a lot can happen through you know South Carolina
28:13
super Tuesday uh a lot of interesting uh you
28:18
know um I remember George HW Bush said
28:24
something like as Iowa goes so go Iowa
28:30
um and that's kind of like you know hey you know Iowa doesn't dictate who ends
28:36
up winning the nomination so no I I think she should go go go I I'm very
28:42
happy with the investment I made and I wrote a song for her I mean I was gonna
28:48
go to the song next so I'm glad you brought this up because I recently heard
28:53
the song well I I wrote with Larry Devin and then we got this this woman who uh
28:58
gret and who sings with the new Fleetwood Mac group or whatever and it's
29:03
a real ear worm I I listen to it yesterday and I have to say I did wake up today with you know we need you Nikki
29:09
right now still stuck my head wonder you're also under playing your role in here you had a pretty important
29:15
like rap feature in this yeah you like my R oh by the way they've they've done some work on the rap so it's better than
29:22
it was I I was going to ask can I hear can I hear some of the rap can you drop a little for us right now
29:28
now no I'm not sure I can because I don't I don't have it all in my I know it sticks in your ear we need you niiki
29:37
right now to lead our nation we need you
29:42
there we go so I mean that's a different
29:48
level there we go and then it's um oh I can tell you this part of the rap
29:55
it's Trump the a bully who's afraid of a fight against 5 in heels with twice his
30:08
might I mean that's a different level of dedication to a candidate than we typically see right I guess I'm asking
30:14
like considering the high road she has to climb to become the nominee what made you say this moment right now is all in
30:22
is that the candidate or is that the political moment at large it's the candidate um I think it's
30:29
Nikki Haley uh and we tend to get the candidate we need at the at the time we
30:35
need it in America usually vote although the voter seems to be usually a little
30:41
bit more open to the candidates that are available um than they seem to be right
30:48
now but and I think in the US we've sort of marched down this path
30:56
where government is too big a part of our lives so I think that that's part of
31:02
what got me excited about Nikki Haley I'm an I'm a venture capitalist I
31:08
back these entrepreneurs who are like two guys and a dog or a girl a guy and a cat and they're getting a business
31:15
started and instead of thinking of their customer or getting themselves started
31:21
with u you know the right team first thing they're thinking about is who's our regulator
31:28
I mean there's something wrong there like we've got the government spent
31:33
under Trump and under Biden I mean both of them are
31:39
micromanaging the economy people underestimate how a light touch
31:46
government can grow an economy so much faster but she gets it Nikki Haley gets
31:53
it one of the things that stuck out to me at the Trump Victory party last night is that they're not just mocking or kind
32:00
of demeaning Nikki Haley which there was a lot of there was a lot of mocking and demeaning of the kind of donor class too
32:07
they would say pretty openly that uh the reason she's going to stay in this race is because people who are rich
32:14
Republicans are going to fund her money and what they're trying to do is speak over the will of the voter who have made
32:21
clear the kind of workingclass Republican voter wants to backd drum I guess I wanted to hear you respond to
32:27
that idea what do you say to the idea that what the donor class is trying to
32:33
do in terms of keeping Nikki Haley afloat is against the will of the base Republican
32:40
voter well I'm rich but um but a lot of the donors are not
32:46
you know what they're getting it it's interesting in the Haley campaign they're getting a lot of small donations
32:52
from women and they're getting donations from Democrats that was those aren't
32:58
Republicans you know like that's not the base of the Republican party is that well I mean it depends on what you mean
33:04
by a base I think Trump just has a lot of people who they're just thinking of
33:11
hey he needs retribution and they're saying I'm not
33:16
thinking about anything else and I hope that they open their minds
33:22
and I hope that they uh start looking at it in a new way but I I can't see that
33:30
happening overnight yeah and I I think um naturally a candidate who has a
33:37
higher Name ID is going to get a broader base of support does that level of vitri
33:42
all from the Trump supporter to the donor class bother you any I guess just more generally and the way the party now
33:49
talks about people like you you know I I tend to find that if
33:56
you just do the thing thing that you think is the right thing uh it works
34:01
out and it comes out in the wash and no I think people are people you know some
34:06
people are going to say you know try to be mean and put you off your game and
34:12
and then we all have slightly different interests yeah and so we all um cheer on
34:19
our own interests and I think that that's kind of the beauty of a free country mhm
34:27
I guess I heard so much anti donor vitria last night is there something
34:33
about the way that you view politics something that way that how you invest
34:38
in it that you think those people are misunderstanding or a message you would have to someone who as they were
34:46
characterizing last night thinks that the act of kind of big donors investing is perverting kind of politics like
34:51
would you have a message to respond to that yeah um you know I actually think
34:59
that um that brand carries a lot lot more um
35:06
cloud in politics than it should I think that uh Trump has a very
35:14
enormous brand and so giving other candidates a chance to go up again against an
35:22
enormous brand is probably uh the way I look at it I I definitely understand you
35:30
know one person one vote and I definitely understand a democracy and how important that is and how everybody
35:37
gets represented and I think that that is really powerful in America and I I
35:43
would be afraid that we would go into a dictatorship at some point if we just
35:50
let these Brands take over you see yourself as leveling the playing field with Trump's brand
35:58
um I think so I think that might be part of it um I I don't think that's the
36:04
whole thing I you know I back startups I back entrepreneurs who are you know
36:12
taking on big Pharma and taking on big Banks and taking on Microsoft and Apple
36:18
and Google and Facebook I I back entrepreneurs where they're they're the
36:24
underdog and eventually they become enormously successful and we
36:31
all benefit from it you know we're all better off because there are Tesla cars out there we're all better off because
36:37
we can see each other on the screen because of what we did at Skype many many years ago and I feel the same way
36:44
um in in backing a um political candidate give them a chance to get out
36:52
there in front of everybody and show their stuff kind my last question is to look
36:58
ahead I know you're hosting a fundraiser for Nikki Haley soon I guess I'm ask I
37:03
guess two you're hosting too okay yeah I guess a question I have is like what are the markers of that you're looking for
37:10
for the campaign to continue the upward trajectory that I think we both know it needs and then a follow-up question I
37:17
have is this if it does end up being Biden versus Trump again do you know what you would do would you donate would
37:24
you vote Trump would you do you know
37:31
um um I don't think that's gonna happen um and uh I think Nikki Haley
37:41
will be the president if it were in that situation I
37:46
would kind of Desperately look for a third party uh and I think a lot of people
37:52
would too I I think there's going to be an ex very interesting couple of months here a
37:59
lot of things happen in politics and I think a lot of things will happen so I
38:05
hear the first step being look to South Carolina and super Tuesday invest more to try to give Haley the bump that she
38:12
needs and continue to close that Gap with Trump and then maybe a secondary step of this this does get to a thing
38:17
that you don't want being a rematch of 2020 would you invest money in a third
38:22
or you'll just deal with that well we might have to follow up in a couple months I don't know
38:28
the the um thing that went off in my head was a a what do we what do you call
38:35
it a um fight or run yeah yeah the fight or
38:45
flight it would it would some instinctual nature would kick in I don't
38:50
know I don't know which way I'm gonna go I'm gonna either fight this thing out or I'm gonna run
38:58
thank you I really appreciate your time this was helpful great you bet never

that's the runup for Thursday January 25th 2024 and now the
40:23
rundown one other thing we were watching closely in New Hampshire was the Democratic primary on the
40:29
Democratic side Joe Biden is the projected winner of tonight's primary now that may not be surprising he is
40:34
after all the incumbent president but this was a very strange Year Joe Biden was in keeping with state law to be the
40:40
first Primary in the nation New Hampshire Democrats voted in an unsanctioned presidential contest where
40:46
President Biden didn't appear on the ballot still through a riding campaign
40:52
Biden won with more than half of the vote president's statement is this it is now clear that Donald Trump will be the
40:58
Republican nominee and my message to the country is the stakes could not be higher in the statement to
41:05
MSNBC Biden said it's clear this is now a twers race between him and Donald
41:11
Trump continues I want to thank all those who wrote my name in this evening in New Hampshire it was a historic
41:17
demonstration of commitment to our Democratic process and I want to say to all those Independents and Republicans
41:23
who share our commitment to core values of our nation our democracy our personal freedoms an economy that gives everyone
41:29
a fair shot to join us As Americans let's remember we are the the South
41:35
