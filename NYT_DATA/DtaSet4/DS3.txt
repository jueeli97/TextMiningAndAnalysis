Democrats Are Panicking About Biden. How Did They Get Here?


0:03
so as you may have heard Thursday night
0:06
was the first debate between President
0:08
Biden and Donald Trump more border
0:10
patrol and more Asylum officers
0:13
president Trump I really don't know what
0:15
he said at the end of that sentence I
0:17
don't think he knows what he said either
0:19
and in short it was not a great night
0:22
for Biden EXC me with um dealing with
0:25
everything we have to do with uh look
0:31
if we finally beat Medicare thank you
0:34
President Biden president Trump this has
0:37
trickered a big freakout among top
0:38
levels of the democratic party which for
0:41
months has been dismissing concerns
0:44
about Biden's age and mental
0:46
Fitness often getting angry at reporters
0:49
like me for even asking the questions
0:53
despite the fact that polling and our
0:55
own reporting have clearly shown that
0:57
concerns about Biden's age physical
1:00
stamina and mental acuity are huge
1:03
factors in this election how are you
1:05
feeling about President B he's getting
1:06
old and I just that makes me sad because
1:09
he's really a good candidate he's too
1:11
old I feel like he's a little out of
1:13
touch but I think he's too old I just
1:15
flat out at some point the age thing has
1:17
to come into play I like Joe Biden when
1:20
he too old I don't think we should have
1:22
deep senior citizens in office making
1:24
decisions for the country his level of
1:27
competence worries me with his age and
1:30
mental Clarity I won't vote for Joe
1:33
Biden in November because he in the ICU
1:37
I was not expecting Biden to run again
1:39
actually I was thinking that logically
1:41
he's old he was going to step down and
1:43
you know his age does trouble me and he
1:45
he seems to be FR I think he half day
1:49
and so for the many people who watched
1:50
the debate or who woke up on Friday
1:52
morning and saw the clips and thought
1:56
how is this happening or how did the
1:58
Democrats let this happen
2:01
here's
2:02
how from The New York Times I'm estad
2:05
hearon and this is a special edition of
2:08
the
2:09
[Music]
2:19
runup he's an excellent president he is
2:22
very good at
2:23
presidenting and his policies have
2:26
worked we've see them we feel them in
2:29
our community and so you say if it ain't
2:32
broke why go with something unknown when
2:34
this guy is such a good president and
2:36
you know we like Uncle Joe that's Leah
2:40
dalry a longtime DNC member and Party
2:43
official we talked to her in February of
2:46
last year at the DNC winter meeting in
2:49
Philadelphia this was not long after the
2:51
midterm elections when Democrats were
2:53
riding high and at the request of
2:56
President Biden and his campaign Party
2:58
leaders were set to change the state
3:00
order of the Democratic primary so that
3:03
South Carolina could vote ahead of Iowa
3:05
and New Hampshire the stated reason was
3:08
a desire to support black voters and
3:11
increase
3:12
representation but since South Carolina
3:14
has long been Biden's second political
3:16
home the decision also seemed designed
3:19
with an eye to
3:20
2024 to scare off any potential Biden
3:23
primary
3:24
Challengers and make his path to the
3:26
nomination just a little bit easier
3:28
those Reasons from the AC coordination
3:30
of at the same time Iowa New Hampshire
3:32
State's Joe Biden's a bad in South
3:34
Carolina's a state he did well in
3:37
couldn't this also be read as a
3:38
president rewarding a state or
3:41
prioritizing a state that serves his
3:43
political
3:44
interest
3:47
and okay I don't have a problem with
3:49
that he's the president he's the head of
3:50
the party so he gets to make the
3:52
decisions that are best for the party
3:55
whether his personal interests played a
3:57
role it aligned with our objectives
4:00
which is to shake up this system to
4:02
ensure that the base of your party who
4:05
shows up every single cycle for you have
4:08
an early s MH that's interesting because
4:11
sometimes I've been asking folks that
4:12
question they've been acting like
4:13
politics is just not involved to this
4:15
political party this is just about this
4:17
is just about the you know
4:19
representation it was just about and so
4:21
I appreciate you saying that because I
4:22
feel like it has to be political well I
4:24
mean for my this is the Democratic party
4:27
we are political every decision we make
4:30
is political so I think it you know to
4:32
say that it's not is kind of
4:33
disingenuous yeah yeah um while we were
4:37
there we also spoke with the chair of
4:39
the DNC Jamie Harrison and asked
4:43
repeatedly do Party leaders have any
4:45
qualms about clearing the path for
4:47
someone who will be 86 years old at the
4:50
end of his second term poll after poll
4:53
say the majority of Americans do not
4:54
want Biden to run for re-election and
4:56
includes the majority of Democrats how
4:58
did the actions with the DNC square with
5:00
that reality listen a poll is a poll but
5:03
what we do know concrete is that Joe
5:05
Biden has delivered for the American
5:07
people with a very slim majority in both
5:09
the house and the Senate so in in the
5:12
end of the day I hope folks understand
5:14
don't bet against Joe Biden I understand
5:16
that I guess it's not a question about
5:17
his accomplishments it's not a question
5:18
about the midterms but that's no no but
5:21
it's a question about do you want that
5:22
person to be the person going forward
5:23
Joe Biden would be 82 but the time of
5:25
2024 it is very reasonable and we have
5:27
talked to voters who like the four last
5:30
four years but still have questions
5:31
about the next four years my question is
5:33
about the next four years but instead
5:35
ultimately people vote for somebody who
5:37
can deliver for them this man has been
5:41
delivering for the American people in a
5:43
way that no president has in recent
5:45
history and so he has the record he
5:48
intends to run for reelection we at the
5:50
DNC are going to make sure that Joe
5:52
Biden stays in the white house for
5:53
another four years there is no inkling
5:56
that he will not be the nominee of our
5:58
party I understand that he deserves
6:01
that there's a reason we were asking
6:03
these questions in early
6:05
2023 because it seemed clear at the time
6:08
that the party was going to effectively
6:09
shut down a truly Open primary process
6:13
before voters had really started paying
6:16
attention and the only person I could
6:18
find who would speak openly about their
6:20
concerns with what the party was doing
6:23
was Biden's former primary Challenger
6:25
julan Castro who famously Fell From
6:28
Grace in the Democrat party after going
6:31
at Biden's age and mental acuity I know
6:34
the facts of what is on you know Biden
6:36
versus Trump and I know that you are
6:38
supportive Democrat I'm asking whether
6:41
you think it's right that the party has
6:43
kind of coalesced around Biden so
6:46
quickly that's kind of shut off the
6:48
doors to other Challengers or really has
6:50
made that decision so explicitly that's
6:53
what I'm really asking well I mean I
6:55
can't blame the Biden team for other
6:59
people not jumping into the
7:01
race I certainly don't hold that against
7:04
him I mean he definitely has a track
7:06
record and has done a lot of positive
7:08
things I mean there's a lot to be proud
7:10
of there for
7:12
Democrats however what I do think the
7:16
DNC should consider is probably o think
7:20
about opening up the primary to some
7:23
debates uh I think that that would
7:25
probably
7:27
benefit the party I think think it would
7:29
benefit Joe Biden and it would help
7:33
ensure that there's a victory in
7:34
November of
7:36
2024 Joe Biden officially announced his
7:38
re-election campaign in April of
7:42
2023 and for much of the Year polling
7:44
around a theoretical Biden Trump rematch
7:47
showed they would be locked in a close
7:49
race not because Trump was unbeatable or
7:52
even a strong
7:54
candidate but because polls continue to
7:56
show both candidates had significant
7:58
weaknesses among the
8:00
public that November we spoke to Quinton
8:03
folks principal Deputy campaign manager
8:06
for the Biden Harris campaign uh to the
8:09
voters who are concerned that President
8:10
Biden is simply too old not that he has
8:12
been a bad president but that the next
8:14
four years they are uncomfortable by the
8:16
just the specific question of age what
8:18
does the campaign say to that I mean I
8:20
would say that at the end of the day
8:22
people don't care when you're lowering
8:24
their health care costs or making things
8:25
in their lives more affordable if that's
8:27
being given to them by somebody that's
8:29
80 or by somebody that's 25 and at the
8:32
end of the day people care about kitchen
8:34
table issues and I think a lot of that
8:36
stuff is Beltway chatter that is from
8:39
people who are out of touch and really
8:40
don't know what voters actually care
8:42
about and again that's why this campaign
8:44
remains focused on continuing to Double
8:46
Down uh and relay those messages about
8:48
the accomplishments of this
8:49
Administration and the wisdom that comes
8:51
along with President Biden's age is
8:53
exactly and precisely what we need at
8:56
this moment to get things done elections
8:58
are a choice M and we know that but it
9:01
is not a choice between Joe Biden and
9:04
300 million people it's a choice between
9:06
Jo Biden and the Alternatives that the
9:08
Republicans are putting forth and the
9:09
agenda that they're putting forth and
9:11
that's the contrast that we're drawing
9:12
and I think it's going to be front and
9:13
center of this election for Americans to
9:15
make that decision that was also the
9:18
argument from vice president kamla
9:19
Harris when I spoke to her last August
9:23
that this was a binary choice for voters
9:25
an age mattered less than policy we are
9:28
we are looking at a moment where we
9:30
could go one or two ways and and and one
9:33
is to stand up in support of and defend
9:36
our democracy and fundamental principles
9:40
upon which we were found such as
9:43
freedom and there is that track or there
9:46
is a track that is about a an attempt to
9:50
destroy all that has made us strong over
9:52
the years in terms of the importance of
9:54
rule of law and and Democratic
9:56
institutions my last question is when we
9:58
talk to Dem soon it had become clear
10:01
that President Biden would not face a
10:02
serious primary Challenge and would
10:05
cruise to the Democratic
10:06
nomination but between polling and what
10:09
we were hearing from voters on the road
10:12
it still seemed like Biden had a serious
10:14
liability when it came to his age which
10:17
could be exploited in a general election
10:19
against
10:21
Trump so as the president was winning
10:23
primaries and amassing the delegates
10:25
needed to secure the party's nomination
10:28
we went back to party insiders to check
10:31
in on how they were feeling about their
10:33
decision to go all in on Biden that
10:36
started with Elaine kmar another DNC
10:39
lifer look we don't elect presidents for
10:43
their ability to be high jumpers or
10:45
longdistance Runners right we elect them
10:48
fundamentally for their judgment and
10:51
their judge you get how do you get good
10:53
judgment experience right and one one of
10:57
the things we can say with absolute
10:59
certainty is that in his first term
11:02
Donald Trump showed consistently poor
11:05
judgment and we have no indication that
11:09
his judgment has gotten any better right
11:11
in the years he's been out of office so
11:14
I think when people settle down and they
11:16
say Okay so the guy looks old the
11:19
question is what does he say what does
11:22
he do and I would add one more thing to
11:24
that Washington is a small town okay
11:28
everybody talk everybody there's just a
11:30
rumor a minute Etc um the president of
11:34
the United States must see 50 100 people
11:38
every week you're like if he had get
11:40
where you're going okay so if he were
11:42
you gotta finish it though you gotta
11:43
finish saying it I C you off so if he
11:45
were like babbling if he were forgetting
11:48
his lines if we were incoherent guess
11:52
what we'd all know it it would take no
11:54
time at all M you know this kind of
11:56
brings me to my final like set of
11:58
questions I mean
11:59
if I was a Democrat who doesn't hate
12:01
Biden but just wanted other options or
12:03
was nervous about having a president who
12:05
would be 86 at the end of their second
12:07
term from the DNC perspective like what
12:09
is your message to
12:11
me nobody else ran my message to you is
12:15
nobody else ran okay so in the absence
12:18
of somebody else running um you have to
12:22
support Joe Biden I mean pure and simple
12:25
that's where we are yeah you you simply
12:27
can't random say oh yeah well I'm
12:30
worried about Biden's age if there's no
12:33
other alternative you need Alternatives
12:36
but the main person I wanted to talk to
12:37
about all this was Ron clay Biden's
12:41
former Chief of Staff Clay is a key
12:44
member of Biden's Inner Circle and
12:46
actually the man who managed his debate
12:49
prep for this week and so when I talked
12:51
to him back in March I came with the
12:54
question why was he so sure that Biden's
12:57
age would be so easily dismissed in the
13:00
general
13:01
election his answer and that
13:03
conversation seem especially relevant
13:06
right now but I guess I wanted to ask
13:08
more broadly why is Joe Biden running
13:10
for re-election particularly given that
13:12
you know most of Americans including
13:14
some Democrats consistently say that in
13:16
our reporting and in National polling
13:18
that they thought he was too old to run
13:20
again well I would say this a lot of
13:23
people run against Donald Trump only one
13:24
has ever beaten him and that's Joe Biden
13:27
so I think he is running in part because
13:29
he's succeeded in defeating Donald Trump
13:31
and I think he was our best option to
13:32
defeat Donald Trump in 2024 protect our
13:35
democracy I also think he's done a good
13:37
job as president he ran on a very
13:40
aggressive agenda for president to have
13:42
the country recover from the pandemic to
13:45
address four crises he saw a crisis of
13:48
the economy in the wake of the pandemic
13:50
a crisis of climate change crisis of
13:53
racism uh and obviously then the
13:55
healthcare Crisis coming out of the
13:56
pandemic and so we set to work on day
13:58
one to try to address all four crises
14:00
and I feel like we made good progress on
14:02
all four of them Al there's a big
14:03
unfinished agenda and he's running to
14:04
finish that agenda I think he has a
14:07
track record that merits re-election and
14:09
an agenda that will drive a second term
14:12
and The Proven track record of taking on
14:14
and defeating Donald Trump you know I
14:16
want to dig deeper there and partly go
14:17
back to 2020 to do that because you
14:20
mentioned the first one about he's the
14:22
person to beat Donald Trump and he has
14:23
the proven track record there I remember
14:26
President Biden's age kind of being an
14:27
open discussion back in 20 even some
14:30
folks thinking he should take a pledge
14:31
to serve only one term can you take me
14:34
inside the campaign at the time you were
14:35
a senior adviser was there any
14:37
discussion of his Advanced age at that
14:39
point and how did you all go about
14:41
trying to respond to the pressure of
14:43
those concerns well obviously it was an
14:45
issue in 2020 people raised it but you
14:48
know I think he defeated it by
14:50
campaigning by uh putting his agenda
14:52
before the country he had I think a bold
14:54
agenda that I think helped reject the
14:57
idea that he was too old because he was
14:58
very forward-looking
14:59
on issues like climate change and race
15:01
and other issues like that and I think
15:03
that that agenda and his energy in the
15:06
campaign his success in debating Donald
15:08
Trump in the fall I think all overcame
15:10
those objections age was an issue in
15:13
2020 it's an issue in 2024 but it's an
15:15
issue and there are other issues too and
15:18
I think the sum of the issues favored
15:20
Biden in 2020 I think they will again in
15:22
2024 I also though remember at the time
15:25
during the Democratic primary there
15:27
being some discussion of this Biden said
15:29
you know I view myself as a bridge not
15:31
as anything else Biden also said I view
15:33
myself as a transition candidate I know
15:36
a lot of people who interpreted that at
15:37
Biden at the time saying that he was
15:39
only going to serve one term including
15:40
media stories that quoted top Biden
15:43
advisers was that not a message that was
15:45
coming from the campaign back in 2020
15:47
that there was a possibility that there
15:48
would just be one term of President
15:50
Biden well I think the first had to be a
15:52
term and so I don't think people in 2020
15:55
were worried about a second term we
15:57
worried about beating Donald Trump and
15:59
ending the four-year disaster we had
16:00
seen so um you know I think the
16:03
president is a bridge he obviously comes
16:05
from another generation his successor
16:07
will be of a different generation than
16:08
he is so I think that is definitely what
16:11
the four or eight years is going to be
16:12
about and I think that also you know he
16:15
I understand there was a lot of
16:16
skepticism about him from the start he's
16:17
overcome that skepticism Democratic
16:19
voters nominated him in 2020 uh he is
16:22
getting a strong vote in the primaries
16:23
in 2024 as well and I think that that's
16:26
where he will be proven at the polls
16:28
ultimately on election day mhm I guess
16:30
I'm asking because when we are on the
16:32
road we talk to so many people including
16:34
Democrats who say that it did not even
16:36
enter their mind the prospect that they
16:38
would be voting for Biden in a kind of
16:40
second term that they thought that there
16:41
was a kind of implicit understanding of
16:43
they didn't know what was going to
16:44
happen but that they were kind of
16:45
pulling an emergency lever in 2020 there
16:47
was a lot of stories at the time I
16:49
remember about the signaling of the
16:51
possibility of one term I'm asking did
16:53
you all overcome those concerns in the
16:54
campaign partially by signaling to
16:56
voters both publicly and Biden
16:58
statements and privately in media
17:01
stories that he may serve one ter that
17:03
that was a
17:05
possibility uh I think we overcame those
17:07
concerns by defeating Donald Trump so uh
17:11
I don't think the C the campaign was not
17:12
running on a message of one term and in
17:14
fact that was suggested that he make
17:16
that pledge he did not he specifically
17:18
did not and uh I think you know voters
17:21
got what they expected in 20120 and now
17:24
he's running again in 2024 and I'm
17:27
confident if he's re-elected he'll serve
17:28
all four years
17:29
I guess there's not really a conflict
17:31
between the results we see in the in the
17:34
large portions of the democratic party
17:35
and even the polling numbers we see
17:36
right like the polling tells us that
17:38
Biden has a unique problem that does not
17:40
translate to the rest of the party and a
17:42
lot of the evidence says that the party
17:44
when it runs candidates that are not
17:46
respectfully 81 that they do fine and so
17:49
I guess I'm saying is there anything
17:51
that Democrats or the Biden campaign is
17:54
doing about a question that does seem
17:56
unique to this candidate
17:59
well I think that President knows that
18:01
age is ining the campaign he said that
18:03
he's acknowledged that I think you're
18:05
going to see the president on the stump
18:06
we get into the campaign season people
18:08
can be able to assess the president how
18:10
he's doing and I think that uh he'll be
18:13
a vigorous campaigner on his own behalf
18:15
uh but I think we have to make the
18:16
argument that his age allows him to have
18:18
more wisdom and perspective as president
18:20
at a time of a complex and a dangerous
18:22
world that Joe Biden's the person you
18:24
want dealing with this mess we have in
18:26
Europe with Putin invading Ukraine and
18:28
you want Joe Biden solving these hard
18:30
problems because he's got the experience
18:31
to do that and certainly if the choice
18:33
between Joe Biden and Donald Trump I
18:35
think Biden's a better choice you know I
18:37
have a last couple questions I really
18:39
appreciate you kind of being a proxy for
18:41
us and taking this time you know I hear
18:43
what you're saying and it reminds me
18:45
that you know Biden's said in the New
18:46
Yorker this week that he's running
18:48
because he's the best suited person to
18:50
beat Donald Trump but as we're talking
18:52
here I've real you know two things have
18:54
changed since 2020 one he is older and
18:56
that concern has loomed bigger in the
18:58
American electorate kind of mind and
19:01
second you know the original 2020
19:03
campaign did have that sense of a bridge
19:07
to it the request to ask people to pull
19:09
that kind of emergency lever and both of
19:11
those things are different does any part
19:13
of you worry that the conditions of this
19:15
election are so different than the one
19:16
four years ago that the president's
19:18
logic of why he's best suited no longer
19:21
applies no I think that you're you seem
19:23
stuck on this idea that he promised a
19:25
single term in 2020 which he explicitly
19:27
did not I I guess tax I think that he
19:30
didn't just narrowly get across the line
19:32
in 2020 he won with the largest vote for
19:34
any candidate for president in the
19:35
history of the country and won
19:37
overwhelmingly in the primaries against
19:39
one of the largest most talented Fields
19:41
anyone's everever faced and you know
19:43
defeating two dozen candidates in the
19:45
nomination battle for president
19:47
including a dramatic Victory on super
19:49
Tuesday in 2020 uh so I think that you
19:53
know his victory in 2020 wasn't some
19:54
kind of just like you know reluctant Act
19:57
of the American people it showed record
19:59
levels of vote in the general and um I
20:03
think what's changed since then is I'll
20:05
admit he is older but he also is even
20:07
more experienced he has delivered
20:09
results and uh he also has an agenda for
20:12
2024 so yes 2024 is obviously a
20:15
different election the 2020 it's four
20:16
years later different issues but the
20:19
candidates are going to be the same and
20:20
I think the outcome will be the same I
20:22
guess I'm not really stuck on the words
20:24
that he says I'm saying that the words
20:26
that he said are indicative of a larger
20:27
feeling that we hear all the time which
20:30
is that an American public did not
20:31
expect Joe Biden to be running for two
20:33
terms and we hear this from Democrats
20:35
Independents like across the aisle I
20:37
guess I'm saying if you don't think that
20:39
that was a perception the 2020 campaign
20:41
gave to people why do you think it's
20:42
such a surprise that the president's
20:44
running for reelection I don't know why
20:46
it's a surprise that he's running for
20:47
free election he never suggested
20:49
otherwise and um I think that uh
20:53
ultimately the people will speak at the
20:55
polls and I think when they speak at the
20:57
polls and they have the choice between
20:58
Joe B bid and Donald Trump they will
20:59
choose Joe Biden and he will be our
21:01
president
21:02
again is saying I okay I I I guess I can
21:06
move on I can move off you've answered
21:07
the question and I totally understand it
21:08
could anything happen this year that
21:10
would change kind of where you are and
21:12
say you know maybe Joe Biden isn't best
21:14
suited to be the Democratic nominee in
21:17
November nothing that I can imagine no
21:20
okay you know recently my colleague has
21:22
recline made a kind of explicit case
21:24
saying that the people Biden listens to
21:26
Barack Obama Chuck Schumer uh he names
21:28
other folks including you need to get
21:30
him to see that Biden might not be best
21:32
position I wanted you to respond to that
21:34
sense of argument that has certainly
21:35
been in the air and I guess I actually
21:37
had a broader question which is like is
21:39
that even the thing that's appropriate
21:41
or people even do in your position or is
21:44
it just Joe Biden's decision well I
21:47
think ultimately it is his decision and
21:49
the decision of the Democratic primary
21:50
voters who are voting for him an
21:52
overwhelming numbers to be our nominee
21:54
so I'll leave it at that look if I
21:56
thought he wasn't the right candidate to
21:58
be Donald Trump I wouldn't be for him
22:00
running but I think he is the right
22:02
candidate and I think that people like
22:03
Ezra who haven't really been in this
22:05
business underestimate how difficult it
22:08
is to beat Trump and have a view that
22:10
just any generic Democrat could beat
22:11
Trump and I'll say it's much more
22:13
complicated than that and I think you
22:15
need someone with the right candidate
22:16
profile and the right skills I think
22:18
that is Joe Biden and I think you
22:20
defeated Trump once I think he'll do it
22:21
again I wonder the specifics on
22:24
candidate profile what is it about Joe
22:25
Biden that makes you think he's harder
22:28
to car
22:29
well I think he has a workingclass
22:31
background that resonates with voters um
22:33
you know the man from Scranton I think
22:36
the fact that he's had a very pro-union
22:39
record as president really connects with
22:40
working people I think that ultimately
22:43
makes it harder for Trump to make him
22:44
into something exotic you know he wasn't
22:46
born with a silver spoon he didn't come
22:49
from privilege he came from you know the
22:51
industrial heartley under the country
22:53
and he's proven he can go toe-to-toe
22:55
with Trump on the debate stage and hold
22:58
his own and so I think that uh to me
23:00
performance is a good indicator and he
23:02
performed in 2020 I think he'll perform
23:04
again in 2024 you know what both sides
23:06
agree on is election is the stakes or at
23:09
least the size of them right when we go
23:11
to D events or R events they say the
23:12
country is on the line and for Democrats
23:14
specifically it's about the prospect of
23:16
trump installing a wide range of
23:18
anti-democratic reforms changing our
23:20
political system our immigration system
23:21
our Judicial System all of the above and
23:24
I know that for the next six months I'm
23:25
going to hear arguments from National
23:27
Democrats and the party saying to people
23:29
who might be upset with Biden or might
23:31
prefer someone younger or might not
23:33
prefer a certain policy here or there
23:34
that they should put those things aside
23:36
because the stakes are so large but I do
23:39
think there is some kind of missing
23:40
acknowledgement that like isn't it also
23:43
a risky thing for the party to do to
23:46
nominate the 81y old compet who a
23:48
majority of Americans perceived as too
23:50
old in the first place like isn't that a
23:51
big risk too to me the risky thing would
23:54
be when you have someone who's beaten
23:56
Trump going with an unproven National
23:58
candidate to try to defeat someone who
24:01
has run for president twice before and
24:03
is now running a third time in Donald
24:04
Trump so I mean there's risks on both
24:06
sides here and every candidate has risks
24:09
and what the president Dr risks is
24:11
inexperience in the National stage
24:13
inexperience in dealing with Trump he
24:15
has those things and those are assets I
24:17
think in the race that some of these
24:19
public criticisms are under counting or
24:20
undervaluing I hear that I guess my last
24:23
question is okay we get the state of
24:24
play we get kind of where we are I've
24:26
posed all the age questions to you the
24:28
campaign has made the similar argument
24:29
that you have made here that the stakes
24:31
will eventually bear them out so is that
24:33
just going to be like a stay the course
24:35
till election day and that the day after
24:37
the election we'll see type of thing or
24:40
is there something about the evidence we
24:43
have seen over sometimes or some of the
24:45
polling we have seen or some of the
24:47
critiques we have heard that is going to
24:50
require the Biden campaign to change a
24:51
strategy before then like what do we
24:53
think might shift because some of the
24:54
arguments I hear from you all aren't
24:56
things that have to change it's just
24:57
going to be like a will tell you the day
24:59
after and we'll be proven correct well I
25:01
think what has to change about the Biden
25:03
campaign is we have to have a campaign
25:05
so I mean there's going to be an
25:06
election the president will go out he'll
25:07
campaign people will hear his argument I
25:09
think they'll be persuaded by it I think
25:11
the more they see him out there on the
25:12
stump the more they'll be saged about
25:13
his age they see him debating Donald
25:15
Trump going toe-to-toe with Trump I
25:17
think again they'll be reassured about
25:18
his age and their doubts about Trump
25:20
will be reinforced but you know the
25:22
thing that has to change about the
25:23
campaign is we need to have a campaign
25:25
and that will come and again four years
25:27
ago this time there were a lot of doubts
25:29
about Joe Biden doubts about whether or
25:31
not he would ever become the nominee and
25:33
he overcame those doubts and you could
25:34
have said to me then well what's going
25:35
to change and what's going to change is
25:37
we'll start voting and we'll see him win
25:39
and that's what it took so you know let
25:41
the campaign
25:45
[Music]
25:48
unfold so that was back in March and for
25:51
the next four months Clay's argument was
25:54
basically the party
25:56
line then Thursday night happened
25:59
sending Democratic Panic into
26:03
overdrive still that Panic is mostly
26:06
coming from people outside Biden's Inner
26:09
Circle and those close to the president
26:12
the people who would likely need to
26:13
convince him to step down for anything
26:15
to change are still voicing their
26:19
support that includes surrogates like
26:22
California governor Gavin Newsome we
26:24
have the opportunity to universally have
26:27
the back of this president who's had our
26:29
back you don't turn your back you go
26:30
home with the one that brought you to
26:32
the dance 100% all in former president
26:35
Obama former president Barack Obama just
26:38
tweeted out he said bad debate nights
26:40
happen trust me I know but this election
26:42
is still a choice between someone who
26:44
has fought for ordinary folks his entire
26:46
life and someone who only cares about
26:48
himself between someone who tells the
26:49
truth who knows right from wrong and
26:51
we'll give it to the American people
26:52
straight and someone who lies through
26:53
his teeth for his own benefit last night
26:55
didn't change that and it's why so much
26:57
is it stay in November that's really
26:59
echoing and other notable Democrats like
27:02
South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn
27:05
and house Democratic leader Hakeem
27:08
Jeff but in what may be the biggest tell
27:11
of all Biden addressed his own
27:13
performance this Friday at a rally in
27:16
North
27:17
Carolina and after years of dismissing
27:19
questions about his age or mental
27:21
Fitness he was suddenly singing a
27:24
different tune I don't walk as easy as I
27:27
used to I don't speak as smoothly as I
27:29
used to I don't de debate as well as I
27:32
used to but I know what I do know I know
27:36
how to tell the
27:42
truth I
27:44
know I know I know right from
27:47
[Music]
27:50
wrong I know how to do this
27:53
job I know how to get things
27:56
done I know like millions of Americans
27:59
know when you get knocked down you get
28:02
back
28:04
up in some ways a notable shift from a
28:08
baguer
28:09
candidate and others a late
28:12
acknowledgement of something voters have
