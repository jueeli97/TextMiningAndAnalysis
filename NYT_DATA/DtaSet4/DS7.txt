Trumpâ€™s Guilty. Does Anyone Care?


0:07
hi my name is estad hearnen I'm a reporter with the New York Times I was looking for Kurt wallik that's me thank you so much for
0:14
picking up do you think that you have maybe 5 10 minutes to chat sure KT can you tell me a little bit about yourself
0:20
what part of the country you in what do you do for living uh how old are you all right so I'm 63 I've lived in
0:28
Arizona for the last 26 years after growing up in the New York City area I'm retired from full-time
0:34
employment although I work security for the Phoenix Suns and every other event
0:39
that goes on at the arena out here awesome and the other question I would ask is do you consider yourself like a
0:45
Democrat Republican independent anything like that I'm a republican although I
0:50
have some uh liberal leanings gotcha well you know one of the specific
0:56
reasons we're calling you is because back in October you were featured in a poll that asked a couple questions about
1:02
your vote and in particular I understand that you said that you were planning to vote for Trump but also that you would
1:08
change your vote to vote for Biden if Trump was criminally convicted and sentenced to prison is that right that's
1:15
right I'm wondering as you can expect how you feel now considering in the last
1:20
week Donald Trump was criminally convicted of 34 felony counts how did you feel about that conviction and has
1:26
it indeed changed how you were thinking about voting well was not happy with the
1:31
conviction um I I think it was a crime that in another world if he was another
1:38
person nobody would have touched it but since they went after him and they got him because technically he did stuff he
1:44
shouldn't have done um that technically is a crime you know he deserves to get
1:50
convicted if they went and bothered to go after him they they got him in terms of my
1:58
vote at this point I would still vote for [Music]
2:06
Trump in the day s to Manhattan jury found Donald Trump guilty of 34 felony
2:12
counts there's really only one big question people are asking will this matter in the general
2:20
election and while it's certainly too early to tell there was one group of Voters in
2:26
particular that I've been thinking about last October the times in Sienna College
2:33
conducted a poll in which they asked Donald Trump's supporters what would happen if you were
2:40
to be convicted and sentenced to prison would you change your
2:45
vote about 7% of trump supporters said in that scenario they would switch their
2:51
vote to Joe Biden but importantly the poll question
2:56
didn't specify which case now how do we know I called back
3:02
some of those 7% and also checked in with the times polling team to understand how a felony
3:09
conviction in late May might affect how people decide what to do in
3:15
November from The New York Times I'm estad hearnen this is the
3:24
runup well could you take me back to the original moment in October what were you thinking when you gave that answer were
3:31
you thinking it was going to be a different case is there a case that would have swayed you cuz I mean at some
3:37
point you did think a conviction might get you enough to move toward Biden so I was thinking along the lines
3:43
of of the January 6 um Uprising yep if you went after him on that and you were
3:50
able to get him on something like that that might make me change my mind but this thing that they got him on I'm
3:56
sorry it just doesn't sway me if I could ask more specifically like what of it
4:02
doesn't sway you is it that it's a business kind of white collar crime is it that it's information that was
4:08
already in the public eye the kind of allegations of hush money payment I mean because I okay so stop stop right there
4:14
so when you say hush money that's not a crime but that's all
4:20
the media says like every time you read about it hear about it it's the hush money trial he wasn't being charged with
4:27
paying off somebody to shut their mouths it was hey I lied on paper and so I did
4:34
some bookkeeping stuff I shouldn't have done right for the purposes of trying to win the
4:40
election and and you tell me that Biden suddenly doing an executive order where
4:47
he he makes it look like he's going to control the Border when he hasn't since
4:52
this whole thing started that's to get reelected so you always place something
5:00
to put yourself in the best light and and that's politics it's you know you
5:06
you make promises that you know you can't keep that's just the way the game is played right so so technically yes
5:14
they made it stick they got a conviction but to me no big
5:20
deal I want to be clear though if there was a trial on the January 6 case and
5:25
Trump was convicted in federal court of of trying to overturn the election you
5:30
you would have not voted for Donald Trump I would have not had voted for Donald Trump and I wish that the
5:36
Republican Party would delist him as a nominee and put somebody else to go up
5:41
against Biden and that person might get my vote instead but because there is not that trial and there's only been this
5:47
state level trial so far you're comfortable with still voting for Donald Trump as the Republican nominee
5:56
yes but but I imagine you saw what happened on the six right like I yeah we
6:02
all saw it we see we we all I saw was a group of people many many of whom came
6:10
out to join the party celebrated protested peaceful I saw another group
6:17
who decided they were going to be bold and crazy and and go into the capital
6:23
and some damag things some not damag things take it as a photo op um is that
6:29
in itself more of an uproar than every
6:35
other let's call it BLM related um riot in any City Center no
6:43
this one January 6th thing Pals in comparison to all all of what else went
6:50
on and had to be dealt with so I I get it it's the capital it's sacred it's
6:56
democracy that's sacred but when you got people taking over Portland in Seattle
7:01
and you've got riots in the streets and people burning down liquor stores and to me the country went through a lot worse
7:08
I hear you you know in Joe Biden's defense he did condemn the element of uh
7:15
destruction or violence that was at those 2020 protest he did not encourage
7:21
that in the same way that you know Donald Trump didn't encourage or help gather Folks at the capital on the six
7:29
it doesn't seem exactly to me like those actions are one toone the same in relationship to the
7:35
politician ah but you had politicians on the Democrat side who were condoning and
7:42
applauding and and I'll say inciting and if you know Biden wants to say well I
7:49
condemned it well did you stop it did you R did you rally all the Democrat
7:54
leaders in in those states and cities and say put an end to this no it
8:00
didn't are you definitely going to vote in November oh yeah I'm voting there's a lot of stuff you got
8:07
that's on the ballots I got I got to vote for everything from local to head head of the
8:13
ticket thank you so much you have a good rest of your day I appreciate your time good luck out there yeah I appreciate it
8:19
have a good day all right bye now
8:25
bye after talking to Kurt hi my name is a hello can you hear me I sure can we
8:32
reached another Arizona voter yeah my name is ested hearen I'm a reporter with the New York Times um I was looking for
8:39
Dakota Jordan Dakota Jordan yeah thank you so much for picking up uh Dakota can
8:44
you just tell me a little bit about yourself what part of the country you're in do you consider yourself a Democrat
8:49
or Republican anything like that I live in desert Southwest and I do not consider myself
8:56
either of those things M do you consider yourself more of an independ dependent or is there any label that you would put on it no independent on that I guess uh
9:06
right leaning I suppose he also told our times Poland
9:11
colleagues in the fall that he would change his vote to Biden in the event of a conviction um I don't think that uh we
9:18
communicated the uh you know the way that I thought about that very well but when we followed up he said it was a
9:25
miscommunication what do you mean by that what did you cuz what were you intending to communicate
9:30
um I believe going back to that uh conversation and what I can remember
9:35
from it I believe I was asked would you vote for Trump and then would you vote for him if he was convicted and I said I
9:42
don't want to vote for him but I also don't want to vote for Joe Biden and then even if he was convicted I still
9:49
wouldn't want to vote for him but given the choice between the two that's who I would vote for so that's how you felt
9:56
back in October yeah has anything changed for
10:01
you in the months following um no not really I still don't want to vote for
10:07
either of those people um but given our phenomenal
10:13
system those are the choices that I'm given so between the two of them yeah I
10:18
guess I'd have to go for the criminal you know a lot of people are in this position of not really liking both
10:24
of their options what leads you to Trump in that scenario over Biden
10:30
couple of things number one under Donald Trump I had affordable rent I had affordable cost of living under Joe
10:37
Biden my cost of living I'm looking at housing I'm looking at inflation I'm looking at these major factors I'm
10:45
looking at not only those I'm looking at the events happening in Israel and
10:50
Palestine and I'm seeing the way that we're handling those situations do I believe that the Palestine thing would
10:56
change much with Donald Trump no I don't if anything I believe that would probably be worse but um looking back at
11:04
inflation cost of living housing that type of stuff I have major problems with those and I believe that Donald Trump
11:11
his main goal is to handle that so you're saying your decision to go back to Trump over Biden is based in the
11:18
belief that you were better off economically in those years versus how you feel now yeah what did you think of
11:24
the recent conviction of trump um I'm not surprised I'm not a big fan of
11:29
Donald Trump's moral character I would say without having personally met the manh I can say what I've inferred from
11:35
him I sincerely doubt his mortal character so if someone came up and saying that they had 34 charges of
11:42
criminal misconduct I would in no way be surprised why then is a lack of moral
11:48
character or even the reality now of a criminal conviction why is that not disqualifying for
11:55
you um because I'm looking at my Alternatives and I see what the
12:02
alternative has done in the last four years I believe that that's worse yeah I'm saying I mean if it's purely about
12:07
economics or kind of what the reality was why they were in office where does moral character factor into you does it
12:14
factor into you oh okay there we go um if I had the choice between candidates
12:21
with good moral character that would lead our country into a more prosperous time that would be my candidate right
12:29
that's who I'm looking for the most if you were to rank the importance of those two issues moral character or economic
12:36
Prosperity I would probably have to go economic Prosperity because right now I work too damn hard for too little to be
12:43
concerned with the exact moral character the individual that got us there can I ask how you voted in 2020 and in
12:50
2016 I did not you did not vote in 2020 I did not did you vote in
12:56
2016 I did not will you vote this time I
13:02
absolutely will be I'm curious what makes you motivated to vote this time that didn't motivate you
13:08
before uh I suppose I was four and eight years younger and situation at hand
13:14
didn't affect me or affected me less right as a 22-year-old I was far less
13:20
concerned with you know my economic well-being now that matters to me a lot
13:26
more as I'm getting into house purchasing age as I'm getting into
13:31
needing to deal with all of the repercussions of these decisions myself now I'm much more interested in voting
13:37
and making sure that I have some type of say in what we're going to accomplish in
13:42
the next four years well thank you Dakota yeah absolutely no worries have a
13:50
great day you as well [Music]
13:56
bye hi my name is estad heren I'm reporter with the New York Times I was looking for Walter beer yes how can I
14:03
help you thank you I appreciate it can you tell me a little bit about yourself Walter uh what part of the country
14:09
you're in how old you are what you do for work things like that I'm Richard live in Las Vegas retired and live in
14:16
Las Vegas awesome what did you do before you retired oh I was in real estate are
14:21
you someone who's considered themselves a Democrat Republican independent any political label I'm not a Democrat I'm
14:28
not Republican I I only vote for who I believe is going to do the job doesn't care who you represent if you're going
14:35
to do the job and represent the people that I'm vot you well let me ask us specifically about the last couple
14:40
elections did you vote in 2020 for the presidential race yes I always vote do
14:46
you mind telling me who you voted for in 2016 and 2020 I voted for Obama well I'm
14:51
asking in 2016 when it was between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump what' you do oh I voted for Donald Trump I did
14:58
not vote for Hill and what did you do when it was Donald Trump versus Joe Biden four years ago I
15:04
voted for Donald Trump I didn't vote for Joe Biden well since you voted for Trump in 2020 I'm wondering what has soured
15:11
you on him a little bit four years later well really haven't soured on that
15:17
I don't like some of the things he' been involved in but then again it just could be politics you know anything
15:25
specifically well his court cases you know but then you know the court case is personal really mhm I was going to ask
15:32
specifically about that I think you told the New York Times polling last fall that you would think about voting for
15:38
Trump but you might change if he was convicted what were you thinking at that time and what changed well I I really
15:44
want to see what what was really taking place to see if if he was really guilty of what he had been accused
15:52
of and in this case you have 34 guilty counts now on falsifying business record
15:59
for you what was your reaction to that verdict the the
16:05
falsification that is taking place I don't
16:11
know I really have mixed emotions about it really well take me through that what
16:17
are the your mixed emotions well is he really guilty I mean
16:23
is is this a plan attack against him and so I I don't really like the way they
16:29
really slamming him you know and I I I guess I really haven't kept kept on top
16:34
of it like I should have and you know uh sometime when you
16:40
you hear the news it's not exactly the way it it really should be so you're
16:45
saying that when you mentioned it last time you were open to seeing what type of evidence emerged but there's
16:51
something about this one that doesn't seem to have fully convinced following it I you haven't really been following
16:57
this one no I really haven't been keeping up with it like I should have I've been involved in a lot of other things you know your personal life
17:04
sometime come before everything else this is politics and politics is gonna
17:09
be what politics is and you can't stop it I totally understand that especially since you know you got still got some
17:15
months before the presidential race do you think you'll catch up on the news do you think that the verdict will matter
17:21
in terms of how you eventually land I'm still in favor of Donald Trump really something about Donald I just
17:30
sometime I think he really represents and stand for the truth of the people you know most politicians known for
17:36
lying all they do is all they are is paid Liars they sit up there and lie they say one thing and do and opposite
17:42
do a complete opposite thank you so much I really appreciate your time all right you have
17:48
a wonderful day yes you too
17:54
bye when we come back how new polling results help us us answer the
18:00
question does any of this [Music]
18:14
matter hey how's it going see how are you good just finalizing these results
18:19
oh awesome live hot from the yeah you are getting very hot yeah
18:26
yes over the past few days colleagues at the times in Sienna College have been
18:31
trying to get a quantitative read on how the verdicts might be changing the race they called back 5,000 people who they
18:38
had talked to in previous surveys and asked the 1900 who agreed to answer more questions who they were vote for to see
18:46
if the conviction has put a dent in Trump's support so we lured a colleague away
18:51
from crunching the numbers on deadline to explain what they found and to talk about who is still undecided on the
18:58
question of Donald Trump or Joe Biden I'm so glad we're doing this can you just introduce yourself and tell me what you do I'm Ruth gelnick I am our staff
19:06
editor for news surveys here at the New York Times um and I help run our time SI pole yes a friend of the Pod you know we
19:14
wanted to come to you because of course the big question in the air after last week's conviction was how might this
19:20
matter when we think about the November election can you just take me back to last week when the conviction news broke
19:25
how did your team start to think about polling yeah so obviously after the conviction broke we started to wonder
19:32
what can we learn about how voters views have changed or not right we we really wondered had their views changed at all
19:39
so we wanted to figure out exactly how to revisit these people so we had this question of whether we should do a new poll or whether we should reach out to
19:46
people we'd already talked to and see if their views had changed and that seemed right like a really interesting option
19:52
for us we've already talked to these people we know their views they've told us themselves let's call them back right
19:58
right can you explain exactly what you were asking people yeah so we are asking
20:03
people a really simple set of questions we just called them back and ask them who they're planning to vote for not
20:09
even if their vote Chang just who they're planning to vote for How likely they are to vote and then one or two
20:14
questions like whether or not they're paying attention to the trial and whether they agreed with the verdict so very simple very short survey
20:21
interesting okay well now take me to these results what does the poll found so we found about 2 to three percentage
20:28
point shift in favor of Biden so when we looked at this group of people this subset of people that we Rec contacted
20:34
last time we talked to them that group was about let me just look at the results it was because we're we're finalizing this now it was plus three
20:42
for Trump and when we talked to those people again it was plus one for Trump so we saw about a 2 percentage Point
20:47
shift looking at it another way about 3% of Trump's supporters moved to Biden
20:53
okay so if we look at the overall survey last time you all did this it was about a plus plus three Advantage for Trump
21:00
we've seen that number shrink in the postc convention to like kind of plus one for Trump which would tell us that
21:05
there has been some movement toward Biden how much can we specifically relate that to the conviction it's hard
21:13
to know I mean we did not ask people directly how much it relates to the conviction there's some real churn in
21:18
here right people are moving in every direction they're moving from Biden to undecided they're moving from Trump to UND decided they're moving from Biden to
21:23
Trump the signal we can find in there is the biggest shift was from Trump to
21:28
Biden so there was some movement away from Biden but it wasn't as large as the movement away from Trump to Biden which
21:35
given the time element really tells us that that's probably related to the conviction but I do think it's worth
21:40
noting that there is a lot of movement and noise in general from the last poll like you know there's just some movement
21:46
in this race this incredibly close race these people who are undecided are kind of moving around a lot they're kind of noisy interesting were you surprised by
21:54
the result and how much should I think about a two percentage Point movement is that a lot is that a little like what's
22:01
the context yeah that's the question I wasn't surprised mostly because other
22:07
people have been doing Rec contact polls and this was about in line with what they were seeing so it was kind of what we expected Echelon insights which as a
22:13
republican pollster did a Rec contact study they found two percentage Point movements which makes sense and I think
22:21
the answer is sort of it's small but meaningful right in these states where
22:26
the results are really close most of the states that matter that will decide the election Trump and Biden are within two
22:31
to three percentage points so that shift could be a real Difference Maker yeah do we know anything about the group that's
22:38
still kind of like open right now to changing their minds is there a specific demographic set or characteristics we
22:44
could say about the people who are moving uh in these Rec contacts yeah the people who are moving in the rec
22:50
contacts aren't necessarily the same as the sort of typical undecided voters we've seen this cycle though there are
22:56
similarities the people who are moving are younger but a difference is the people who are moving in this survey are
23:02
a little bit more white a little bit more educated a little bit more like we're seeing as the typical Biden
23:07
supporter in our last several surveys suggesting that it's a little bit of coming home from these people who maybe
23:14
supported Biden in 2020 are thinking about Trump are curious about Trump but might be coming back after the verdict
23:21
yeah you know we were particularly interested in the particular group of Voters that y'all talked to last fall
23:26
who said that they would vote for Trump but they would maybe switch their minds if there was a conviction it seemed a
23:33
small group of people about 7% but it did seem as if that was a kind of open
23:38
question do you remember putting that question together and how were you all thinking about specifically targeting
23:43
that group yeah so at the time it's interesting to think back to what we were thinking at the time because at the time this trial the Manhattan hush money
23:51
trial was not the trial that we expected to be first right we were thinking at the time about the January 6th trial
23:56
that we thought was GNA and so we kind of designed some of the questions around that trial in particular to kind of
24:02
think we could have a time one and time two where we remeasured people again now that wasn't the trial that happened but
24:08
we left this question fairly open-ended because we were curious in general to have this preo on if Trump was convicted
24:15
which is a very hard hypothetical to people yeah if Trump was convicted and in the question we said convicted or S
24:21
and sentenced to prison how would that change your vote and and we got about 7% of trump supporters saying that they
24:27
would switch which again is in line with what we would think a small but meaningful share and so we wanted to see
24:33
if that number would grow or Shrink with an actual conviction uhuh now I know that that is not the group that you all
24:39
call back this time but we did actually call some of those people can you just tell me why you all chose to focus on
24:44
the national rather than this specific group in October yeah I mean it was really just sort of a resource issue we
24:50
wanted to talk to the most recent surveys first so we looked at our last two surveys our national survey and our
24:56
Battleground surveys those were the two most that we did and we thought if we had enough time and resources we'd get
25:01
back to those October folks that were really interesting and it was just you know what we could get done in the time that we had no no totally understandable
25:08
but it's good that you guys talk to them because they are an interesting group yeah and I was actually going to throw some of that to you when we talked to
25:13
some of them we heard a number of people basically say yeah I meant it but not
25:19
this trial and maybe you know someone specifically mentioned if it was January 6th they may have changed their mind
25:25
some people mentioned that they just you know once this conviction came came down they didn't see it as really um that
25:32
consequential I guess my question to you is like you mentioned a couple of piece of evidence of people moving from Trump
25:37
to Biden but it doesn't seem like Republicans largely are taking this verdict and shifting any is that correct
25:45
that's correct this I mean these shifts are very minor right these are some people moving from Trump to Biden a slightly bigger group about 4% moving
25:52
from Trump to undecided but Republicans r large this didn't really have an impact on them and part of the reason
25:58
back in October that we' hoped to focus on the January 6th trial is from polling from us and others we asked across the
26:05
four trials that were likely to happen which one people take most seriously and overwhelmingly Republicans and everyone
26:12
said January 6 totally checks out with what we hear on the road yeah yeah yeah yeah and so I think you know it's not
26:18
surprising that you wouldd hear from these Republican voters who said yeah sure if it was January 6 but in this case you know they see it as a long time
26:24
ago the hush money payments didn't really matter it was kind of a stretch some people saw it as very politically
26:30
motivated and so you know I'm not shocked that you guys heard that when you called people back we talked to some
26:35
people when we were calling folks back who said that they actually they had always supported Trump from the first survey and the survey actually had them
26:42
down wrong I you know I will stand you what you all do till I die but how
26:48
should I understand like some of the data mismatches that we hear when we call some people back versus what the
26:54
data set tells us yeah I mean it's a really good question right because like that's real you guys are calling these
26:59
people back and they're saying that doesn't match there are two things that are happening one is real measurement error this happens if you listen to our
27:07
calls sometimes people don't understand what we're saying people aren't always you know they're not aware of the
27:13
question and they might give a sort of acquiescing response where they just tell us what they think we want to hear but the other piece of that is among
27:20
this group of switchers these people who are maybe moving their vote a lot it's not as Salient as it is for a lot of
27:26
people who are more politically engaged they don't remember who they said they were going to vote for cuz they're not really sure who they're going to vote
27:31
for so they're like oh no last time I swear I said Joe Biden but maybe at that time they were feeling really frustrated
27:36
with Joe Biden like if you look at this group of switchers they're more politically moderate they're more likely
27:41
to say that they voted for a different candidate in the past or not voted so some of this is real measurement error
27:47
like some of this is you know we aren't always measuring views perfectly but some of it is amazingly to the
27:52
politically engaged and probably most people listening to this podcast a lot of people haven't made up their mind and
27:58
honestly don't remember what they said last time because it just wasn't that important to them mhm yeah like they're legitimately undecided so they should
28:05
have thought something last time and think something different I swear I didn't think that last time but they might have yeah yeah yeah you know one
28:11
thing that really is my kind it bothers me right now and maybe I've just been this is just my vibe feeling so you can
28:17
tell me if this is actually factual but like I'm sick of people acting like Trump is this
28:24
unbeatable super strong candidate that nothing impact when I'm like it feels to me like the
28:31
evidence points to a very weak Republican candidate that the party would be well served if someone else was
28:36
at the top of the ticket but relative to another unpopular candidate in terms of Joe Biden he's doing fine so I'm like it
28:43
seems to me that like when we think about the trial and conviction it fall it often falls into this category of like people saying oh another thing
28:50
where it doesn't matter where I'm like it feels as if swing voters have been holding Donald Trump's craziness against
28:57
them for multiple Cycles I feels like it's faked in do you get what I'm saying like it feels like a switch and framing
29:03
here is important I think this is a good this is a good point which is to say you're right it is when Trump was up
29:08
against a stronger Democrat previous Joe Biden he didn't win he didn't do well
29:14
because he is a fairly weak Republican but now that he's up against a weaker Democratic candidate current Joe Biden
29:20
yeah it's really challenging for him now the other side of that is you know people call him Teflon Don and when you look at his approval ratings they are
29:26
remarkably stable as compared hisor candidates and and figures so it
29:32
is true that he's not getting these kind of like twists and turns that a lot of people are getting but you're also right
29:37
that when he was up against a stronger Democrat he really didn't have the strength to fight him what then if this
29:44
moment which I think a lot of people were pointing to as something that could be a sea change in the race I think there was some evidence there before
29:49
that could have caught that into question but a lot of people were thinking about this moment as something that can change the race and if we're
29:56
really talking about two percentage points year if we look ahead I mean of course things will pop up that we don't
30:02
know but like if we think to debates or conventions or the kind of normal um set
30:09
plays that we know happen in the campaign Trail are any of those moments threatened to be as big or or just as
30:15
big as the conviction or even bigger yeah I think the debate is a really good one I mean I think that that the Biden
30:20
campaign knew that and that's part of what that sort of decision to move the debates up earlier could be I mean you
30:25
know this is something that the Biden campaign doesn't love when we poll about but we have a lot of polling about
30:31
Biden's age and this is a huge concern for voters a huge concern for voters and I think yeah like for as much as they
30:38
want to like like you know you you don't have to say of I'll say it it's ridiculous that they think that's a crazy question to ask because it's a
30:44
huge concern people it's a huge concern for voters and so this could be a real switch in the race right if Biden does
30:50
well and you know doesn't have these sort of age concerns that people are worried about much like the State of the Union it could be a really solid moment
30:57
for him if there's a slip up or a trip up then this could be a real moment in the race and I think the debates are a real piece of that and I think that like
31:04
even though it's so early even though it's so early I think I think part of the Biden campaigns I think you know
31:10
moved to move it early was to make it matter Less in the race there is still going to be a debate in the fall right there are two debates and I think both
31:17
of them will really matter the last question I had specific to the legal questions is when we think of this
31:23
politically like it does this close the chapter you think on Trump's legal problems and its impact in the
31:30
election like would a sentence change anything like you know what I'm saying like or do we think that this reaction
31:36
is basically where this chapter ends yeah I mean assuming the sort of
31:41
calendar stays as it does and and no additional trials are scheduled right everything seems to be have been bumped
31:47
back I don't think a lot else changes this I don't think a sentence changes this I think I mean you have people who
31:52
are more expert than me on this that will tell you that he's probably not going to be sentenced to jail and so
31:58
I don't think that any of the other sentences would necessarily change this in this survey and in our past surveys
32:03
we ask about attention to the Trump legal troubles and very few people are paying attention I think a quarter say
32:10
they're paying a lot of attention so it's hard to feel like any of the subsequent legal things really move the needle for these groups uhhuh uhhuh
32:17
thank you so much Ruth this is so helpful thanks for having me thanks that was fun yeah f it was interesting though
32:23
the callbacks yeah it's uh yeah
32:30
what Ruth is saying really checks out to me in our days of making
32:36
calls we heard from a lot of people hi my name is ested hearnen I'm a reporter with the New York Times I was looking
32:42
for Brian Dickenson I was looking for Joyce Cooper I was looking for Melanie W I was looking for Steven Henry what's up
32:49
in a lot of different fields yeah I live up in North Georgia I'm a trucker I am a
32:55
manager in Corporate America I live like outside of Pittsburgh in between Pittsburgh and Ohio on a farm and we
33:02
raised be cows and while they had all heard about Trump's conviction our poll indicated that last time you said that
33:10
you were consider voting for Trump but that if he were to be criminally convicted you would think about switching over to vote for Biden is that
33:18
correct right well you know it can change from one day to the next right um it wasn't really moving the needle in
33:25
terms of their vote as a things right now I'd probably just vote for Biden uh
33:30
you know who doesn't want federally legal marijuana their opinions were based on other factors when we were
33:36
looking at the polling data it said that when they first called you in around April and May that you said that you
33:42
would be open to voting for Trump if but if there was a conviction you would switch over to Biden is that
33:48
correct no that's not correct and I was super clear that Trump was never an
33:54
option and some of them seem to be hoping something else happens before
34:00
November when the polling comes out closer to November this is seems to be
34:05
like a a thing with me where I really am like I'm going to vote independent this time I really really am I truly am and
34:11
then as it gets closer and I see how close Pennsylvania is I'm like um you
34:17
know I don't know if I'm going to go back to anything is better than Trump and I will absolutely
34:25
um decide who I'm actually going to vote for as we get
34:31
closer then they'll make up their [Music]

35:15
it was been published widely by many of you that he didn't want to fix the issue he wanted to use it to attack me he
35:23
denounced Donald Trump in his speech blaming the former president's interference for the failure of a
35:28
bipartisan immigration reform measure in the Senate earlier this year immigration
