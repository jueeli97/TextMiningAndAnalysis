‘Right Where We Want Him, 30 Points Up’: Chasing Trump in Iowa


0:01
we're now just 4 days from the Iowa Caucasus we're polling averages show Donald Trump ahead by nearly 35 points
0:09
and it seems like an important moment to remember something at this time last year many national Republicans did not
0:17
expect to be in this situation they thought they had a plan and not just a plan a person to make it happen Florida
0:25
Governor Rona santz was supposed to be the perfect Trump alternative someone who could win the voters tired
0:32
of Trump's Antics and also bring along the movement Trump activated the idea was to learn from the
0:39
mistakes of 2016 and coales around him quickly the problem is none of it
0:46
worked and there was one event that made clear the challenges for DeSantis the
0:51
Lincoln dinner a high-profile event in Iowa where DeSantis spoke last summer
0:56
along with most of the other GOP candidates including Trump my colleague Caitlyn O'Keefe was there and asked
1:04
people in attendance what they thought about the Sis's candidacy my feeling is
1:09
is D Sis's personality with Iowa's type of politicking is maybe a little bit of a
1:16
challenge now not that he doesn't have a good one but he's just not that I don't know maybe he seems a little more
1:22
reserved maybe that's the right way and the answer is then help explain where we are now I personally just don't think he
1:29
should run against right now I think if anything they should join forces Ian
1:34
some Republicans like to santis and held out hope for a comeback after his
1:39
campaign recalibrated he's uh making adjustments like any business person would do if
1:46
they got some dead wood you get rid of it I think they're those in the news media trying to find things to tear down
1:53
or shoot his candidacy but you got to look at how many people have come into
1:58
the race or Republican president and he'll spurt out ahead I'd say by the
2:05
first of the year uh he'll be dead even with Trump in Iowa so think but the
2:10
biggest problem several voters articulated was one Dan santis can't do anything about I think my general
2:16
thoughts on him he feels like he's the cover band trying to replace Trump you know we don't need the cover band yet we
2:22
still have Trump so I feel that he's not needed yet I think he'd be great in Florida but I think Trump's really who
2:29
we need to run the Nation right now he's simply not Donald Trump I guess he like has proven himself in Florida but I
2:35
don't think he'd be a good president he's just not gaining the traction honestly I don't think anyone can go against Trump he just he too popular and
2:41
he doesn't Inspire the same devotion I'm very excited to be here I've been a trump supporter the moment that he
2:47
walked down that golden escalator we know that he um is an amazing man and
2:53
this is where I stand with all of his indictments and that sort of thing I am going to vote for the man with the most
2:59
impeachments and the most indictments we know when he steps into that white house he's going to clean house and make
3:05
America much better and that's why he has my fullest support I love him I think he's amazing he's the most amazing
3:11
president of my lifetime and he still fights for us and that's a huge reason
3:17
why he is the perfect man at this perfect time who God has totally put into place for such a time as
3:24
this today did anti-trump Republicans simply rally around the wrong person and
3:31
with the presidential primary set to start next week have they run out of time to fix it from The New York Times
3:38
I'm estad hearnen this is the [Music]
On the trail with Dan DeSantis
3:45
runup hey how are you hey Dad good to see you man my colleague Nick Nas is
3:50
covering the Des santis campaign I talked to him from his current home away from home an Iowa hotel but he's usually
3:56
based in Florida where he's followed to San's career for years I asked them what
4:02
it feels like to be on the campaign trail with Dan santis right now yeah so right now Dan santis is taking the
4:09
volume approach he is fighting against a former president who is overwhelmingly
4:15
popular with Republican voters but who is not campaigning a whole heck of a lot is not out there on the trail and so the
4:21
Dana strategy is we are going to hit every small town in Iowa you know hit
4:27
every County a lot of them more than once do what they call the full grassly
4:33
and you know shake every hand explain that for folks full grassly what's that in reference to the full Grassley is a reference to the Senator Chuck Grassley
4:41
who every year makes a stop in each of Iowa's 99 counties and the last three
4:48
candidates who have won Iowa have done the full grassly so danis is doing what
4:54
a Republican or what a candidate normally needs to do to win Iowa right that's what it normally takes but
5:00
obviously this year is not normal so what's the mood like on the campaign as he continues with this full grassly
5:07
traditional Iowa campaign style approach but it's not really working so it feels
5:13
a little bit like a death march there there is that aspect like you know we're running between stops to talk to crowds
5:20
of 50 to 100 people at the same time there's some energy in the room but when
5:26
you compare it to a trump event I mean Dan sanis over two days maybe Drew 1500
5:33
people in 10 stops in small towns on a recent tour Trump the next day got 2,000
5:39
people in a high school gym for one event so the dynamic of the race it really feels like in these rooms you
5:46
have this guy who's trying and trying and trying and trying and just not really getting anywhere the polls aren't
5:52
moving so after the fifth event of the day I think it feels for everyone a little bit like banging your head
5:58
against a wall yeah the bleakness has set in in the last week or so where even
6:04
people who come to these events and support them you ask them well do you really think he can beat Trump and they
6:10
kind of say I hope so that's different from a couple months ago where where you
6:16
know people were really hoping that the polls would be moving by now and they're just not and if anyone has had some
6:23
momentum it's Nikki Haley right it's flown elsewhere you know at one point do santis appear to be a really exceptional
6:29
Pace among the candidates particularly at the beginning of this race he was the candidate who represented you know
6:34
trumpism without the baggage in the minds of many republican uh voters and going back to that time just after the
6:41
midterms part of the reason Des Sanchez Rose was that he appeared to many as someone who could kind of Build Together
6:48
a republican Coalition like wasn't that the thinking kind of in that post midterms pre-presidential announcement
6:54
time that's absolutely right he did something historic in Florida which has
6:59
been a swing state he won by 20 points he really seemed Invincible whereas a
7:06
lot of the Trump back candidates lost in 2022 he turned the state red and he used
7:12
that to pass a bunch of really conservative laws so he absolutely at that point seemed like the great hope of
7:19
the Republican Party young compelling Fearless willing to stick to his guns
7:25
military career I mean he had all the ingredients of someone who seemed like he was about to take off in a
7:31
presidential race exactly I mean you can see the resume on paper and I think he kind of become America's conservative
7:38
Governor at least that's how he was pitching himself I'm curious like on that night in Florida when he did win by
7:45
so much more than expected was it certain that he would run like from your
7:50
perspective as someone who was following him was that inevitable it feels like it
7:56
was inevitable his operation was in place before the reelection to run for
8:02
president this very much has always felt like the plan certainly when he rose to
8:07
prominence during covid his National Ambitions were clear so he knew he was
8:14
going to do it and he had the kind of paper resume to do it and he had you
8:19
know to your point pre-planned organization and infrastructure to kind of put in place once he announced his
8:25
presidential campaign so I guess I'll ask you a kind of like 20,000 question over the last year why don't you think
8:31
it's worked out as planned I think there's a part in which he looked good on paper and was a paper tiger MH in
8:41
Florida the Democratic party has been in big trouble for years he was able to win
8:48
reelection icing out the mainstream media and only doing TV events or TV ads
8:55
and you know televis kind of rallies when you're running for for president you have to talk to the media you have
9:03
to interact one-on-one with voters and those were not his skill set now take
9:09
him out of it he's running against Donald Trump yeah anyone is going to struggle to beat Donald Trump I think
9:16
especially once the indictments happen but his strategy of running to the right
9:22
against Trump has seemed flawed from the beginning also do you have particular
9:29
moment that sticks out to you that you think really kind of encapsulates the gap between the initial hype around
Dan DeSantis Twitter launch
9:36
Ronda Sanz and what we saw is the reality I mean I think you don't have to look any further than his Twitter
9:44
launch um the way he he chose to launch his campaign in a Twitter spaces with
9:51
Elon Musk sorry about that we we've got so many people here so let's
9:57
see keep crashing well cly and it was so buggy it took half an hour even to get
10:04
started and then when he gets on he's talking about all these really obscure topics like University
10:12
accreditation some of the problems with the university and the ideological capture that didn't happen by accident
10:18
can trace back all the way to the accreditation cartels well guess what of interest to like right-wing people who
10:25
are very online yeah and what he could have done is I was just talking to a
10:31
strategist about this he could have had a rally on the baseball field of his
10:36
middle class Hometown outside Tampa where he grew up you know the state that
10:42
he had successfully LED through the pandemic and just done a traditional campaign launch instead because of his
10:50
bizarre choice to do it on this internet platform like the first month of stories about him were negative and mention this
10:57
disastrous launch it seemed at the time like a huge miscalculation and looking back on it now I think it's set the tone
11:05
for this campaign he was not Mr Invincible he was Mr hapless all of a sudden and the Trump campaign took
11:11
advantage of that yeah I remember being shocked at the Twitter space's announcement it seemed like someone who
11:18
was making choices that were less to your point traditional but even more so than that running a very specific type
11:24
of campaign I guess my question is like why like who was making that decision to
11:31
say start with Elon Musk rather than doing that kind of traditional method I think it's really simple the dusanis
11:38
campaign had run his very successful re-election for governor and they were
11:44
determined to use that same strategy that we talked about icing out the mainstream media being very cautious and
11:52
curated not interacting with voters that was the strategy and part of that is
11:58
that danis trusts very few people his closest advisers are his wife and a
12:04
group of friends from his time as an undergraduate at Yale and you know a couple political operatives and and
12:11
strategists but it's a very small circle they did not want to bring in anyone new and I think their inexperience at this
12:17
level really showed in a big way in the first few months of the campaign yeah and they also thought that they could
12:23
run a national campaign where they were competing in all of the early States and
12:28
even Beyond in places like California and they're running against
12:33
Donald Trump it would seem on the face of it that if you're going to run against an extremely popular former
12:39
president you need to run an Insurgent style campaign and they were running
12:44
like they were the favorite and so their staff was too big they had to do two
12:49
rounds of layoffs which generated another you know whole media narrative
12:55
and they had to refocus the campaign completely on one state in Iowa and all this played out in real time it was just
13:02
like a drip drip drip of oh more layoffs here more layoffs here we're moving the staff to Iowa they never controlled the
13:09
message the way they did in Florida right so this is when the Allin on Iowa strategy starts to be implemented what
13:15
does that reset effort look like so he launched in May what they called the reset started in July all of a sudden
13:23
he's talking to the Press every day he' Gaggle with us every day he's taking
13:28
questions from voters at every event 10 15 questions he's he's shaking every hand snapping that's already sh from
13:35
what we were seeing before that's that's a big shift and not only that he's on shows like Morning Joe and Meet the
13:43
Press you know whereas I who've known him for years you know was almost rubbing my eyes when I turned on the TV
13:48
and disbelief so there was a a big big shift they refocused on Iowa and you
13:55
know it seems like started running the campaign that maybe they should have been running from the very beginning when you saw that shift did
The shift in tone
14:03
the candidate seem comfortable with it I guess I'm wondering like was it just the change in tone or were we seeing a
14:08
different candidate it felt like we were seeing a candidate trying to do
14:14
something that he had not been prepared for very well interesting why why do you say that well in Florida you don't have
14:20
to do the glad handing and the baby kissing in Iowa and New Hampshire you do
14:25
and there were just these moments that jumped out you know and I I will say they look worse on Twitter when they're
14:32
just cut out um and presented out of context but there is a famous moment we were at a County Fair somewhere in Iowa
14:39
oh what is that icy and he sees a a young girl
14:45
drinking an icy yeah I remember this yeah that's probably a lot of sugar huh
14:50
good to see it and he says oh boy you know there's a lot of sugar in that and
14:56
you know I will say at the time it was kind of funny like he a dad with young kids but it wasn't really the most
15:02
Charming thing to say to to a little kid and and there's just a lot of examples
15:07
of that he's not that comfortable I mean and look let's be real like being a politician in these retail settings is a
15:13
bizarre thing it's super awkward yeah you're meeting dozens of people in a row you don't know who they are you know but
15:20
politicians have become good at it and to sanis the thing that jumped out to me
15:26
jumps out to me still is when someone introduces themselves or says where they're from or what they do his
15:31
response is always okay I'm Timon okay how are you I'm
15:36
wonderful it's great to be up this very excited okay instead of you know like oh I'm Ron or nice to meet you or hi my
15:44
name is a okay yeah exactly that's what it'll be like and it and I know that
15:49
people have tried to talk to him and you know he he is who he is and he's won
15:54
election as the governor of the nation's thirdd largest state yeah twice but there are these awkward moments and I
16:01
can keep giving you them you know give me another one I I want I kind of want to hear another one too um the one that
16:06
really jumps out to me was and this was in the same transition period we were at
16:12
a coffee shop big packed coffee shop and this young woman she's 15 years old she
16:17
raises her hand to ask him a question so if you have a mental health disorder and you can't work in the military what all
16:23
do that include because a lot and she starts saying that she wants to serve in the military I'm only 15 so this may not
16:30
matter as much I can't legally vote but um I struggle with major depressive
16:35
disorder well it's never stopped the other party from letting you vote so I'll just you know put that go ahead and
16:41
I suffer with anxiety and but she has depression and she's wondering if that
16:48
will disqualify her from serving and before she can really get that question out he makes a joke about her age and
16:55
says oh the Democrats would let you vote what if I want work in the military but I cannot because of these mental health
17:01
disorders that I have and then she starts talking about her depression look I think at the end of the day when you're dealing with the military um what
17:08
it's all about is they have certain things that they need and to me as an observer it really seem like a moment
17:15
for a skilled candidate to say that is so brave of you to open up I'm so glad
17:21
you want to serve your country but there are going to be some criteria for both physical and mental uh that are done and
17:28
it's all about just whatever the best for the unit is and to try to do that so I'll take a look and instead he gave
17:34
this answer very quick answer about unit cohesion and how important it is and I talked to this young woman after the
17:41
event and she was she was really taken aback by the whole experience and she said she had asked the question because
17:47
she was inspired by his discussion of how he had served in the military so
17:53
they're just the whole campaign feels like it's littered with these missed opportunities to connect with voters as
17:58
human beings you never want to be in a position where a person is coming in to an event liking you and leaving liking
The DeSantis voters
18:07
you less you know like that does not seem to be how one wins enough votes to become the nominee exactly and that's
18:14
you know what the poll numbers have shown in a way I mean the Trump campaign phrases it very directly and the Haley
18:20
campaign does as well the more people get to know Ronda sanis the less they like him now that might be an unfair
18:27
characterization a whole number of things that have been outside of his control during the campaign but from
18:33
what I can tell it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of inspiration going on at these events yeah well we' talked
18:40
about the people who haven't warmed to him who are the DeSantis voters at this stage and how would you kind of describe
18:46
the profile of voter that you're meeting who still is kind of excited about him I would say they tend to have a four-year
18:52
college degree MH they often have a young family so they're really concerned
18:58
about what happens in schools and whether their children will be forced to take a vaccine or not and Dan sis has
19:05
spread a lot of misinformation about the safety of vaccines so that message
19:11
really appeals to people that's interesting though the both the degree piece and the family piece as being the
19:16
kind of through lines between the voters that really jumps out to me you attribute that mostly to vaccines and
19:22
schools I mean his limitations on discussing race and sexual and gender in
19:30
schools his Banning of gender care for transgender children all that has really
19:36
jumped out to people the other through line is definitely Evangelical and by that I don't just
19:42
mean people who describe themselves as Evangelical but people who go to church once or more than once a week they have
19:50
responded specifically to abortion as an issue they've responded to danis getting endorsements from influential
19:57
Evangelical leaders from the governor of the state Kim Reynolds yeah I was going to say this reminds me of the people
20:02
we've met who like him in Iowa and that's specifically that kind of church goinging crowd yeah yeah and so if you
20:08
switch to New Hampshire they're not as many of those voters New Hampshire is much more moderate and so there was a
20:15
while in the campaign where he would talk about abortion a lot in Iowa and not mention it in New Hampshire and now
20:21
in New Hampshire he's fallen to fourth and fifth they for all intents and purposes have given up on New Hampshire
20:27
in a big way H so at this point what is their path ahead so it kind of reminds
20:34
me for several months it has reminded me of the meme and I'm not going to capture it exactly right I think but it's like
20:41
step one win Iowa step two I don't know
20:47
step three beat Donald Trump yeah so the argument has been they do well in Iowa
20:53
and that creates some momentum in New Hampshire where they finish well enough that they can keep going and then you
20:59
know win South Carolina and keep going it's just it's never really happened before like the
21:05
person who wins Iowa has not won the nomination since George W yeah so it
21:11
doesn't seem like there's a great path for him to win the nomination even if he does really well in Iowa at a certain
21:18
point it seems like people kind of tacitly move to santis to the background of this campaign because he's been
21:23
running so far behind Trump and to your point it's only been moving in the wrong direction since he started when you talk
21:30
to the campaign now have they accepted the reality of that tough position I
21:36
think everyone in the orbit acknowledges that he's not going to win Iowa but they're still hoping for a
21:43
close second they're setting expectations where a close second is a win and gives him some momentum going
21:49
into New Hampshire but they also ackowledge that he's not going to win New Hampshire whereas you know a few
21:56
months ago you would have people this was not really Gallo's humor like this was people saying oh we've got Trump
22:04
right where we want him like 30 points up you know really overconfident we're about to move wait for the next poll
22:10
we're going to Surge yeah and it just never happened and so I think there's an understanding that it's not going to
22:16
happen at this point I guess I'm wondering do you think it's too early to be on Ronda santz Dropout watch no I I
22:24
don't I think a third place finish is really bad for him Iowa is a state that
22:29
should be much friendlier to a Hardline conservative like Ronda santis and someone who projects a more moderate
22:36
image like Nikki Haley I think that would be a real indictment of his strategy and a spectacular implosion of
22:43
of tens of millions of dollars spent on this race yeah yeah know I think about
22:48
the differences between the 2024 race and the 2016 race and in 2016 you know
22:55
there was such a clear problem for republicans who did not coales around non-trump
23:01
options before it was too late you had so many candidates getting the race initially and you had so many people
23:06
stay in long enough where it really helped Donald Trump assume the nomination 2024 seems like a little bit
23:13
of a different story you did have some level of coordination specifically around Ronda santz and donor money
23:19
really flowing to him really early it seemed like less of a story about like lack of coordination or coalescing or
23:26
infrastructure and more like that it just happened around a guy who like Republican voters just like less than
23:33
people assumed I I think that's true and the other interesting thing that I should point out I think that really
23:38
kind of illustrates the problem facing the Republican party or the anti-trump
23:44
wi of the Republican party in this cycle is that you had the two anti-trump
23:49
governors of the early States Kim Reynolds in Iowa and Chris cuno of New Hampshire endorse different candidates
23:56
yeah what would this race looked like if they had gotten on the phone and said hey we need to unite you know this part
24:03
of the party behind one candidate but that that didn't happen yeah one of the
24:09
things that seems really clear at least when we talk to Haley versus the santis folks is that the santis people aren't
24:15
all that anti-trump some might have specific issues or whatever but like it's not like they're like rising up to
24:20
block him from the nomination whereas the Haley folks are seeming to be working from a different kind of value
24:25
set like do you think the Ronda s operation would rather Donald Trump be the nominee than Nikki Haley that is
24:31
absolutely the sense I get you know because like you said a lot of D Santa supporters I mean this is a line I've
24:37
heard dozens and dozens dozens of times they love the Trump Administration they
24:43
really like a lot of what he did they are tired of the crassness the insults
24:48
the vulgar language they feel like his time has pass and they're ready for a
24:54
new very conservative Republican but they don't think Trump is a threat to democracy they tend to think the
25:00
election was stolen in fact which we know it was not and you're right there's a very different profile between Haley
25:08
supporters and and Dana supporters and they have very different feelings often times when it comes to Donald Trump well
25:14
good luck ni I really appreciate your time thank you so much for talking to us thank you for having
25:20
me more after the [Music]
25:26
break [Music]
Nikki Haleys rise
25:37
[Music] when the primary started Florida Governor Rona Sanz was seen as the
25:42
biggest threat to Donald Trump and that assumption had a big impact on the early
25:47
months of the race for DeSantis who was able to gobble up key donors and
25:54
endorsements and for other candidates like former South Carolina Governor Nikki
25:59
Haley she announced her run in February 3 months before Des santis but
26:04
languished in the polls and was largely ignored by her opponents in recent months though as the
26:11
santis has struggled and anti-trump Republicans have sought different options Haley star rose even eclipsing
26:19
Dan santis in New Hampshire where recent poll from CNN puts her only seven points
26:24
behind Donald Trump in fact besides Trump himself Haley is the only candidate who seems to
26:31
have gained support in the last year particularly among the donors and Republican insiders who once prefer D
26:39
santis So after talking with Nick about the Grim reality for Dan santis I wanted
26:44
to talk with someone who could help me understand how Haley took advantage of that and I also had another question how
26:51
seriously should we take her rise hello I don't think oh hey here you are how are you hey hey I call Jasmine uoa where
27:00
are you de Mo oh you're you're just warming it up we'll be there uh we'll be
27:05
in Iowa tomorrow as Jasmine has covered Haley's campaign she has watched her crowds and appeal grow and seen her give
27:12
her stump speech so many times she has the Applause lines memorized yeah I I can anticipate the
27:19
Applause in the audience at this [Music]
27:25
point Haley's poll numbers were BAS basically stuck at 5% until the end of the summer and she saw some more
What was the catalyst
27:31
momentum into the fall and going into the new year uh I guess I want to ask a kind of broader question what do you
27:37
think was the biggest causes of that upward momentum what was the Catalyst yeah I would definitely say it
27:44
was her strong debate performances the fact that she pitched herself as this you know experienced
27:50
candidate on foreign policy and the fact that she has been stwart on her stances on on providing Aid to Ukraine on
27:57
defending Israel um and definitely her pleas for consensus on abortion whenever
28:04
she takes questions from voters there's bound to be an abortion question and sometimes it's even a female voter who
28:11
has heard her stance before but wants her to articulate it again to the broader audience and you know as as
28:18
governor of South Carolina she signed some of the harshest anti-abortion laws in the country at the time but now I
28:26
think what really resonates with Republican voters is her pleas to
28:31
Republicans that they not be so judgmental on the issue and her pleas to Democrats that they not stir so much
28:37
fear on the issue and so that's what I hear from from voters a lot is that she's trying to thread the needle but
28:45
again it it's also an issue that she's being attacked on from both the left and the right it seems indicative of her
28:50
candidacy a kind of creation of consensus seems to be what she's trying to do so if we would think about who the
28:57
average Haley supporter that you meet on the trail is what do they look like what do they sound like what's their uh most
29:03
important issue it runs a gamut just to give you an example of how varied it is right I was at a brewery here in Iowa
29:12
and during the Q&A you had an older male voter ask her what are you going to do
29:19
about the January 6 quote unquote political prisoners strong question and
29:25
then at the same time in the same audience there was another veteran who asked did Mr Trump trample or defend the
29:32
Constitution and is he running for president or
29:38
Emperor I love audience questions because like you know they're not subtle you know they they they definitely like
29:47
have a point of view yes yes um and so you know as usual she she weighed her
29:54
words very carefully and to that second man she resp responded she said that the courts would decide whether president
29:59
Trump did something wrong and that he had a right to defend himself against the legal charges he faces but she also
30:05
expressed disappointment that when Trump had the chance to stop the capital attack he did
30:11
not and then of course she said you know my goal is not to worry about being president forever that is why I'm going
30:17
to win and that Drew loud Applause from the audience but when I went up to that second voter after the answer he seemed
30:25
a little bit more it disappointed he that she hadn't condemned Trump more
30:30
clearly that he hadn't that she hadn't condemned Trump more clearly and he said I wish he had declared him unfit to be
30:36
president I wish she had the political courage that someone like say Liz Cheney
30:45
has or Chris Christie has yeah I mean I think that's this whole scenario is part of the reason you know we wanted to talk
30:51
with you is because what Haley seems to be doing that kind of consensus Building walking a thin line slight lightly
30:58
condemning Trump but not you know fully condemning Trump that seems to be a really difficult path uh particularly in
31:05
this version of the Republican Party how does the Haley campaign see its path to
31:10
winning the way she talks about it the way her allies talk about this race the way they see it is they need to come in
31:17
top three in Iowa people will drop out she does really well in New Hampshire
31:23
more people will drop out and then this race will become a one-on-one match in her home state of South Carolina and
31:29
that's where you know she she takes it right quote unquote and now you know I'm not I don't
31:35
want to put you in the position of defending this but there's a lot of assumptions in that set of exactly
31:41
exactly yes yes and I was speaking with Governor Chris anunu of New Hampshire about this and he said once it gets down
31:49
it's already a one-on-one race really between her and and Trump there's nobody else in this race that has the kind of
31:54
traction that that she has if it's going to be anybody who can beat him it's going to be her and and he swore that
32:01
like once voters really start to realize that there's going to be this whole psychological change in voters minds and
32:07
perceptions of the race and and that that will broaden what's possible for her let's slow that down you're saying
Haleys stumbles
32:13
that the the the Haley campaign's um kind of Hope here is that she finishes
32:20
in top three in Iowa she performs well in New Hampshire and then because the other candidates would drop out it could
32:27
set up a oneone matchup with her and Trump going into her home state of South Carolina and they think in that 101
32:33
matchup that's when she can kind of uh overtake the former president yeah yeah and I mean up until this point you know
32:40
she's got the money to go far she's got the infastructure it's just a matter of
32:46
it's just I'm saying it's just a matter of it and it's like a really big matter
32:51
of of of how do you say like broadening the
32:58
imagination it's a matter of math yeah yeah yeah as you mentioned Haley was
33:03
experiencing some momentum going in to the new year but you know she's also had some bad headlines in the last couple of
33:09
weeks can you take us through some of the stumbles that she's experienced in this kind of home stretch because that's
33:15
been just as much in the news as the good poll numbers right so she had a couple of stumbles she was asked about
33:22
the causes of the Civil War and she failed to mention
33:28
slavery she flubbed the name of the Iowa hawkey's star basketball player Caitlyn
33:34
Clark and then she's I don't know which one of those is worse to be
33:39
honest I don't know if I should say that as a local black person but those are both really
33:44
[Laughter] bad and then she's again you know she
33:51
she potentially provoked the anti-trump faction again when she said that she would pardon Mr Trump
33:57
uh should he be convicted when she was asked at at a recent Town Hall but with voters at least I don't think they
34:04
really have registered because I've talked to so many voters since then and for all of them like it it really didn't
34:11
really seem to register like they either forgave her for making the mistake or
34:16
brushed it aside as saying like anybody can make a mistake like that on the on the
34:22
trail yeah I I I guess if you are a person backing Niki Haley in this
34:28
primary right now you don't really have many other options of places to go I can
34:35
see how your best choice in that scenario is rationalization well yeah and you've already rationalized so much
34:40
to get to this point right this is a candidate who has said she would pardon Trump if he were to be convicted who
34:46
would support him uh as a republican nominate you know she raised her hand in that first debate to say that she would
34:52
support him even if he were convicted of a even if he was convicted crime she
34:57
hasn't categorically ruled out not running as his vice president which I think that is actually the bigger
35:03
sticking point with Independence is you know I talked to one man who recently told me it I I'm just really concerned
35:11
that she hasn't flat out said I'm not going to serve in that man's presidency right and
35:16
and I think a lot of Independents would feel very betrayed if we vote for her and then later she drops out and here
35:22
she is on the ticket with Trump I think those are both really interesting points because in that kind
35:29
of line walking that you're describing you know she has tried to still make herself palatable to the Trump crowd but
35:37
I remember being at CPAC last year where Haley had just recently announced her
35:43
candidacy and it was so memorable how thoroughly she was booed right because
35:49
on one hand you see this candidate who is not saying certain things in hopes of winning these people's votes and on the
35:55
other hand I see all these Trump people saying we're never going to vote for this person so I guess I'm wondering how
36:00
real is the Haley campaign kind of dream to win over those Trump voters in the
36:06
first place do you see real Trump supporters at her events or is it more Democrats and
36:12
independents I do see people who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 who really
36:17
like the president's policies and some who believe that he just wasn't given a fair Shake by the media or whatever and
36:25
and even some people who who would like to see him president again but they feel like he's the victim of the system I've
36:31
heard that from some people in her crowd but either they're tired of the chaos they're tired of the tweets i' I've
36:37
heard this from several people they don't want Democrats you know attacking him again like it it just it just stir
36:43
too much controversy in their mind but those diard Trump supporters the ones
36:49
that you're talking about no I don't see many of those if any it is it is a more independent it is more of an independent
36:57
Centrist crowd yeah again it's just such a different Republican party like if you go back when she first entered politics
37:04
in 2004 she beat a a 30-year incumbent and she was niiki who right nobody knew
37:10
her and when she won for governor again she went up against some really tough political heavy
37:16
weights and and won and became the first woman of color to lead a Southern state
37:22
but at the same time she was Rising throughout this whole time on the moment of the tea party right that
37:28
anti-establishment anti-immigrant movement that was happening in the
37:33
country at the time and so when she won her governor's race she had the endorsement of mid
37:41
Romney representing that really establishment part of the party but she also had Sarah Palin which was like a
37:47
tea party star and kind of gave her that last minute boost a lot of that energy
37:53
is now behind Trump that tea party energy that anti-establishment energy is now behind Trump I love this point yeah
38:01
I mean it's really interesting because I think the way you lay it out even helps me sharpen the way I was thinking about it because you're right like she wasn't
38:07
always branded as the kind of establishment figure that kind of trump in movement had or doing right now she
38:13
came up kind of using the Coalition both sides of the coin Mitt Romney plus Sarah
38:19
Palin uh uh thing that she's still trying to do now it's just that the Palin slice of the party the Tea Party
38:26
slice the party has morphed into a kind of America First swing that is completely behind Donald Trump at this
38:32
point and even if they're not behind Donald Trump their second option is probably Rhonda Sanchez over her right
38:39
yeah I think that's absolutely right and I think that's going to be her problem going forward you can see a Universe in
38:46
which if Donald Trump didn't happen right that Nikki Haley was positioning
38:52
herself as someone who can take on the mantle for that Grassroots and kind of play in The Establishment Lane but it
38:59
does feel as if you know he has sucked up so much of that energy I guess I want to ask one last question like do you
39:06
have any indication about whether Nikki Haley at this point does find Donald Trump unacceptable like she's had so
39:13
much anti-trump energy flow to her but this does not seem like an anti-trump person Am I
39:20
Wrong oh that's a hard question I guess we don't know right yeah I mean it goes
39:26
back to the the what is what are her true convictions right like you know even as Des santis went after Trump more
39:32
aggressively like she hasn't changed course you know she's got her stock
39:37
response to Trump that you know he did some good things he he tackled the Border
39:43
he it's not clear it's not clear it's not clear and which I guess is like the Nicki Haley
39:50
story it's not clear she doesn't talk to reporters she takes very few questions well let's end with a question
39:57
about Iowa cuz I'll be joining you there uh tomorrow and through this weekend what was your Iowa purchase what was your Iowa weather purchase I as soon as
40:04
I landed I went to REI and bought some gloves because I did not have strong enough
40:10
gloves that's how helpful for me I'll buy some gloves tonight thanks Jasmine I really appreciate your time thank
40:16
you we'll see you early next week as we're back on Monday caucus de with the
40:22
run-ups guide to Iowa that's the run up for Thursday January
Rundown
40:29
11th now the rundown and it's clear to me tonight that there isn't a path for me
40:37
to win the nomination which is why I'm suspending my campaign tonight for president of the
40:43
United States Wednesday evening hours before a debate he had not qualified for
40:49
former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced he was suspending his presidential campaign on his way out
40:55
instead of endorsing anyone he fired a parting shot at his Challengers and the
41:01
front runner Donald Trump and anyone who is unwilling to say that he is unfit to
41:08
be president of the United States is unfit themselves be president of the
41:13
United States the other Republican candidates for president have been traveling all over Iowa this week with
41:20
campaign stops across the state ahead of next week's caucuses meanwhile I'd like to introduce
41:25
president Trump well I want to thank you all and Trump spent part of his week not in Iowa but
41:31
in Washington DC where an appeals court is hearing arguments on one of his pending legal cases that's a very sad
41:38
thing that's happened with this whole situation when they talk about uh threat
41:44
to democracy that's your real threat to democracy and I feel that as a president
41:50
you have to have immunity very simple a panel of three appeals court judges expressed skepticism that the former
41:56
president is immune from prosecution for plotting to overthrow the 2020 election
42:01
the case is expected to end up before The Supreme Court we're 4 days away from the Iowa
42:06
caucuses and 299 days away from the general election we'll see you next
