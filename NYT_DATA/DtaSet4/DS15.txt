Charlie Kirk Wants to Overhaul Nebraskaâ€™s Voting System


0:00
[Music] so right now Joe Biden's clearest path to victory in November seems to go
0:07
through the middle of the country here's what it looks like Biden wins Pennsylvania Wisconsin and Michigan
0:15
key Battleground states in the Midwest and if he does that and wins the other states that usually go Blue it brings
0:22
him to 269 electoral votes just one vote shy of securing the
0:28
presidency and that that's where Nebraska comes in Nebraska is one of just two states that distributes
0:34
electoral votes proportionately rather than win or take all meaning that even though it's a red
0:41
state it sometimes still gives one of its five electoral votes to a Democrat
0:46
as it did for Biden in 2020 but the fact that this year that
0:51
one electoral vote could be the one that puts Biden over the top has caught the attention of Donald Trump and some
0:58
supporters and in recent weeks they mobilized throwing Nebraska's unique
1:04
electoral system into flux today a story about the Electoral
1:10
College the power of right-wing media and the fight over who gets a voice in
1:15
our elections from The New York Times I'm estad hearnen this is the
1:23
[Music]
1:28
runup let's take a second to reset so this current fight started a
1:35
little over a year ago when without any Fanfare at least as far as I can tell a
1:41
bill was introduced in the Nebraska State Legislature the next bill will be lb
1:49
764 lb 764 and we will invite Senator lipincott
1:55
to the chair it was sponsored by state senator Lauren lipincott
2:00
Lauren L Ren lip and CS Li i p p i n Co T and I represent District number 34 in
2:08
the Nebraska legislature I'm here to introduce lb 764 to return Nebraska to
2:15
the winter take all system for electing the president and vice president of the United States Nebraska started splitting
2:22
its votes in the 90s I'm sure everyone in the room is aware that only Nebraska and Maine split their Al votes liping
2:32
Cott and other state Republicans we moving to flip it back the best policy decision for Nebraska is to return to
2:40
voting for President and Vice President of the United States as a whole state
2:46
thank you for your time and I'd be happy to answer any questions all right thank you for your testimony that's what was up for
2:52
discussion at this Committee hearing over a year ago you once slip and cot spoke there was a discussion and then
3:00
we will reset for lb 364 the committee moved on to the next
3:06
bill and nothing happened lippincott's proposal didn't get voted out of
3:11
committee it just sat there until a week ago what if I told you that Nebraska
3:18
could deliver a single electoral vote to Trump in the next couple weeks it's completely in their hands let's do it
3:24
let's act when right-wing media figure Charlie Kirk got involved in episode of
3:30
his podcast he laid out the stakes if they do not fix this in Nebraska and
3:36
Donald Trump wins Nevada and he wins Arizona and he wins Georgia and he wins Ohio and he wins Iowa and he wins
3:43
Florida Joe Biden becomes president by one electoral vote and again Kirk is
3:51
right about this it's not likely but not totally out of the question that the one
3:57
electoral vote in Nebraska could really matter or even function as an electoral
4:02
tiebreaker and essentially determine the winner we need every single Nebraska
4:08
Patriot and heck any Patriot around the country to contact Governor Pan's office and to demand that this Republican
4:15
conservative governor of the great state of Nebraska gets their act into gear and
4:22
fixes this this is not hard Kirk called on his listeners to act this shouldn't be this hard it shouldn't take a
4:29
30-year-old talk show host and organizer who lives in Arizona to have to fly to Nebraska but you know what let's just
4:34
get it done enough complaining and all this went from nothing to something very
4:42
quickly this is how fast it moved Kirk's episode went up on his
4:47
website at 4:49 p.m. on April 2nd by 5:48 p.m. on the 2nd Nebraska governor
4:54
Jim pillan had already put out a statement on X offering his support for a winner take all system he wrote quote
5:02
I call upon fellow Republicans in the legislature to pass this bill to my desk so I can sign it into law by 8:38 p.m.
5:10
on the 2 former president Trump had shared the governor's statement on his true Social account calling it quote a
5:17
very smart letter by 9:45 p.m. he put out another statement on Truth social
5:24
writing thank you governor for your bold leadership let's hope the Senate does the right thing Nebraskans
5:30
respectfully ask your Senators to support this great bill and the very next day the measure was being debated
5:36
on the floor of the Nebraska legislature which by the way has its own unique claim to fame it's unicameral meaning
5:44
unlike the US Congress the Nebraska legislature only has one house every lawmaker is called a senator and it's
5:52
officially nonpartisan good evening colleagues and
5:58
good evening Nebraska today um I stand before you as many of
6:03
our colleagues do to discuss one of the cornerstones of our Democratic process here in Nebraska our unique system of
6:10
apportioning Electoral College votes by congressional district Defenders of the current system did most of the talking
6:17
what we do in splitting the electoral votes the in Nebraska is we create a
6:25
greater opportunity for our constituents across the state to have their voice
6:33
heard in the presidential process and that is a really cool thing
6:40
it's been a thing of Pride for a lot of Nebraskans especially those in congressional district to to say you
6:47
know we've had a part in you know the presidential elections you know that's
6:54
something that's what motivates people to get out to vote and especially people from our community it's it's hard
7:01
honestly to get people to vote because a lot of times people don't feel as though their votes matter their votes are going
7:09
to change things because for for for so long things really don't change and
7:15
things they wanted to keep things the way they were we don't have to bend
7:22
over as a legislative body a serious deliberative body the only deliberative body in the
7:28
state because an incel tween tweeted something
7:35
and they weren't happy about the way this had all gone down toward the end of the debate Senator SL you're recognized
7:42
opening on your [Music] Amendment thank you Mr President and
7:48
good evening colleagues the person who'd gotten the measure to the floor Senator
7:53
Julie SL a republican got up to speak I want to take this to a vote there are a
7:59
lot of of people on both the state and National level
8:05
saying we should do this and there are a bunch of my colleagues who argue that we should do
8:12
this but when the rubber meets the road where do you stand Republicans all too often can talk
8:19
the talk but they can't walk the walk and actually get the thing they're seeking achieved well here we have an
8:25
opportunity to do it now she urged other Republicans to vote with her just know
8:31
this vote this is where you can walk the walk instead of just talking the talk
8:37
thank you Mr President Bob it's been a request for roll call vote reverse order Mr
8:43
clerk Senator Wishard no voting no Senator Wayne No voting no Senator walls
8:51
no voting no Senator vill voting no sen Vargas when the votes were counted
8:56
motion to overrule the chair fails Mr clerk the win or take all amendment was
9:01
voted down on procedural grounds which allowed State Republicans to avoid voting yes or no on the substance of the
9:08
bill still it seems Maga Republicans are just getting started please welcome to
9:14
the stage Turning Point action founder and president Charlie
9:21
Kerr and on Tuesday Charlie Kirk held a rally in Omaha which drew a crowd of
9:27
several hundred according to local reports he delivered a message to the state's Republican Governor you guys have the
9:33
power in this state and I am confident that the governor is going to call into special session and then we're going to
9:39
have to work the members and we're going to have to do all we'll get to that and the eyes of the nation are on this beautiful state get this done or
9:49
else if there is just radio silence out of nowhere we'll do the next event on the steps of the capital just like you
9:55
guys did with the vaccine mandates if we have to and a few hours after the event ended
10:02
Governor pillan made it clear that he gotten the message writing quote although it is now clear that win or
10:08
take all cannot pass during the regular legislative session I look forward to partnering with legislative leaders to
10:15
moving it forward in a special session when there is sufficient support in the legislature to pass
10:21
it more after the [Music]
10:28
break [Music]
10:35
whether or not Nebraska changes its voting system could affect the race between Biden and Trump but it's also
10:41
about more than that it's about the weird unequal way America elects the
10:46
president so after learning about the efforts to get Nebraska to ditch its proportional voting system I wondered
10:54
why it had that system in the first place
11:00
so I called up two people who could help hello hi my name is ested hearnen I'm a
11:05
reporter with the New York Times I was looking for Diana this is she hey thank you for
11:10
picking up Diana shimik and Ernie Chambers is this Ernie Chambers yes it
11:16
is thank you so much for picking up how's your day going oh very well look
11:21
at my age when you're conscious it's a good day but I'm a little more than just
11:28
conscious to what what age is that how old are you Ernie 86 okay well thank you for picking
11:35
up they were both longtime members of the Nebraska State Legislature and Ernie's actually running again for the
11:41
seat he first took in 1970 I read that for most of your career ear you were the only person in the legislature who
11:48
wasn't white that's true that that's true and the way I was able to make it and it infuriated my colleagues or I
11:56
should say it endeared me it depends on your point of view I would tell them when they were doing their worst against
12:02
me if Alibaba can handle 40 thieves certainly I can handle 48 white
12:09
people and they were there back in 1991 when Nebraska adopted its proportional
12:15
vote system when Nebraska was getting its split vote system in 1991 do you remember how that came to be what
12:22
exactly was the story there well there was a female senator named Diana shimik
12:27
for whom I had great respect but she had argued that with a win or
12:33
take all situation and Nebraska was considered R through and through no
12:40
other candidate from any party would come to Nebraska to campaign because it
12:45
meant nothing so to prevent Nebraska from being a flyover State why don't we
12:51
try something different I entered the legislature in '89 so I had only been in
12:58
the leg lure a couple of years when I introduced the bill I used a capital t
13:06
and a capital be when I say the bill because it's sure gotten a lot of attention well I wanted to ask about
13:12
what happened in 1991 you were the original sponsor of the legislation to make Nebraska a split vote state right
13:19
can you tell me how that came to be I had gone to a conference somewhere I don't even remember what it was it was a
13:26
legislator's conference and I understood that some states were looking
13:32
at this idea and that Maine already had uh the split electoral vote scheme and
13:40
so it sounded very intriguing to me and I came back and looked into it and
13:46
finally decided to introduce it well I guess why did you think it was a good
13:52
idea what made you you know after you were at the conference and heard what Maine did What attracted you
13:57
specifically to the split vot idea well it seemed to me to be a fair system and
14:04
it seemed to me that people ought to be able to vote for the one they thought
14:09
represented their area the best also I thought it would get voters more
14:17
involved if they thought they actually had a chance of voting for somebody who
14:22
might become president and then finally I think I thought that it would bring
14:29
more candidates to the state they would be willing to come if there was an electoral vote or two up for grabs Ernie
14:38
who represented North Omaha supported it for similar reasons if the only thing
14:43
that would happen in this state is that whichever candidate got the most votes would get all the electoral votes then
14:50
when it came to a presidential election black people and poor white people and are progressive white people need not
14:57
vote at all because the Republic is always going to win there'd be no point
15:02
in participating in the presidential aspect of the election only the locals
15:08
but when you have the opportunity to give a candidate of your
15:14
choice one electoral vote then it's worth the effort of trying to get people
15:20
to vote and for me it will bring them to the polls and they'll vote in greater
15:26
numbers at the local level also what have you thought about the latest Republican effort to undo it well since
15:34
that bill passed originally in 91 there have been multiple
15:40
bills introduced in this in the legislature to repeal that
15:46
passage it's it's been a constant in my life but ultimately I
15:53
think the people like it frankly Diana feels pretty confident the legislation
15:59
has helped Nebraska do you think more States I mean you did this initially because you thought it was more fair did
16:04
you expect more states to adopt this system do you wish more States adopted the system in Nebraska well of course
16:10
and I've had a lot of inquiries over the years and the problem that Most states
16:17
have is they have two houses and they might be able to get it past in one house but not the other
16:24
house it's difficult to get past in a partisan legislature I think uh because
16:32
people start reading between the lines in playing their own scenario with the
16:39
provisions of the bill it depends on where you live so and I think the larger
16:44
States particularly don't want to bust up their huge electoral vote count they
16:52
have a lot of clout with that electoral count so I think it's more appealing to
16:59
small states frankly at this point from my advantage point now I think that's
17:05
probably the case you know you you kind of change history in your state in a big
17:10
way a way that I think a lot of people have just accepted the Electoral College
17:16
and presidential voting system to be what it is you changed it in your state and thus like you know the Electoral
17:22
College overall looking back how does that feel and what what do you think the lasting impact is
17:29
well I think lasing impact will be if it stays on the book and if it continues to
17:36
be a part of our system that will be the lasting impact uh because I think it's
17:42
had real positive results um here in Nebraska there's lots of speculation
17:50
about a scenario in which the vote is tied except for there's one vote still
17:55
hanging out there and it's Nebraska that makes the decision I think that's that's ludicrous
18:03
but anyway um it it could happen I suppose I don't think that that ever
18:10
would uh but I think the lasting effect is that people get more engaged and more
18:18
interested in what's going on in the electoral
18:24
system thank you so much for your time I appreciate you chatting with us toight
18:29
thank you very much o okay I appreciate you calling
18:34
[Music] me so for Diana and Ernie who help put
18:43
the proportional vote system into place this is about fairness and representation it's a way to help people
18:49
feel like their vote matters particularly Democrats in Omaha who likely would otherwise be drowned out by
18:56
the state's conservative majority but I also wanted to hear how people on
19:01
the other side were thinking about this especially the lawmakers who had supported the change to a winner take
19:07
off system how were they thinking about Nebraska's political minority was this just in service of
19:14
Donald Trump's re-election um well can I just first
19:20
have you introduce yourself and tell me what you do well my first name is M M RV like MV
19:29
Griffin and my last name is reape and that's r i PE I called state senator MV
19:35
reapy we uh specifically wanted to talk to you because you are one of the people who voted for this winner take all
19:41
measure a bill that would change the way that Nebraska elects presidents can you tell me about that bill and why you
19:48
ended up supporting it well I'm a big fan of voting by legislative districts
19:55
and awarding electorial College votes by districts if States other than Nebraska
20:01
and Maine would do likewise if everyone would play by the same rules I think it
20:08
would be a great enhancement to our legislative process but because they don't it puts Nebraska and Maine at a
20:16
disadvantage by putting at risk and in in Nebraska it primarily puts the risk
20:23
of Omaha which is the second district and it has been it was lost to
20:29
President Obama and was lost to candidate Joe Biden it's known as the
20:35
blue dot in the election world and there was fear that it might get down to that
20:40
one particular vote which could determine who would be the next president of the United States and so it
20:48
was honorable on Nebraska's side and I think they did the right
20:53
thing when they went to each district getting one vote and then they had too
20:58
at large but no one else saw the virtue of that and so it was a a well-meaning
21:08
effort that uh put us at a disadvantage in my opinion what do you mean there by
21:14
risk like I I get what you're saying that it does create the possibility that this one congressional district could as
21:20
it did last cycle back someone different than the state overall but why is that necessarily all that
21:26
bad well nebr is a conservative state if it makes a difference in who gets
21:32
elected president that's an incredibly big difference you're saying that because of
21:39
the possibility that this District could have outsize impact and because this District Trends less conservative than
21:46
the state overall then what I guess I don't get what the end of that sentence is like
21:51
why isn't it just that the people of that District you know are having their voices heard or whatever they let's turn
21:57
it on a te in California if you took it by District California is not going to get all
22:04
Democrats unless so same story here you the Omaha
22:10
area is what I would call a very purple district and so that one vote could
22:17
swing the entire election and if the other states aren't going to play by the
22:23
same rules Nebraska shouldn't either we heard some possibility about the governor uh maybe calling a special
22:30
session do you think he has the votes he stands a very good chance of having
22:35
those votes now it depends upon how strong he feels about it and quite frankly to call a special session the
22:43
story that I have heard and I can't I is that it's about $100,000 to call a special
22:49
session so whether he wants to spend $100,000 that way or not I do not know
22:55
you know I I wanted to ask to be clear you at at this point you want Nebraska to change to a winner takeoff system but
23:02
overall you are supportive of a proportional vote system if other states had it exactly right if other states
23:11
would go to the same system that Nebraska and Maine have I think it would be a better system because I am not a
23:18
fan of the popular vote I think the electorial college has Merit but I think
23:24
it would be better served and closer to the people if they had it
23:29
however the district went that is how the what would dictate in every state how the electorial college vote would go
23:36
for that District so your problem in terms of Nebraska system isn't the proportional vote it seems to be
23:43
partially because of how Omaha is voting the fact that that might give an electoral vote to a
23:49
Democrat is that the issue well I just mine is consistency
23:56
regardless of you know you know if it's just unfair for Nebraska whether that
24:03
because there's no guarantee that the Democrats in this case Biden will get that that electorial vote it we'll know
24:10
that right after the election but it it will be a close one in the second
24:17
district but let's say this election does for some crazy reason come down to
24:23
the second congressional district in Nebraska I guess I'm wondering why is that so bad like that's literally the
24:29
rules right well it all comes down to making a
24:35
sports analy here we all need if we're playing soccer and we all need to work
24:41
by the soccer rules and not have two states Maine and Nebraska that are
24:46
planned by some other rules that are just inconsistent now do I want a
24:52
national legislation that says all states will go by uh congressional districts yeah I would certainly
24:58
entertain that but uh it's not going to happen I don't believe but all I want to
25:05
do is I just want a fair deal you know I in in learning about
25:10
this story I think about Nebraska's unique unic Camal State Legislature I think about this unique proportional
25:16
vote system and it seems as if both of those were kind of born out of an idea
25:21
that folks should have like a kind of like local democracy work together direct democracy implications is that
25:28
why these things came to be in the first place am I reading that right I think that you're reading that
25:34
right I think I think people thought that uh this was more
25:40
representative it got it down to the Local District for example uh the western part of Nebraska is very rural
25:48
we lightly say that Omaha is the east coast of Nebraska you know and so if it
25:54
wasn't omal and Lincoln as the Two Urban centers would totally dominate the whole thing and uh
26:02
so was trying to give more representation it was probably somewhat
26:07
related to the unic Camal so I guess my last question would be like if you all were to change it
26:14
would any of you be kind of sad or or does that lose anything about the
26:20
Democratic lower D nature of politics it's something lost you know it is
26:26
unique that some Nebraskans actually do have a more direct representational vote
26:31
uh when it comes to the president would anything be lost by taking that away well if it's lost is lost to 48 other
26:38
states who don't recognize it as having Merit yeah for the state in Nebraska I
26:45
think probably the response would be we gave it one heck of a try and uh now
26:51
it's time to move on as they say very few things last forever thank you so much senator I
26:58
appreciate your time and thanks for chatting with us thank you by Rey wasn't
27:03
the only Nebraska Republican we talked to Senator Steve Erdman was even more
27:09
explicit I always have been in favor of win or take all uh we changed this uh
27:14
several decades ago and I thought it was a mistake then and I still do now and so that was the reason that I voted a
27:20
change it B if the majority of the people in the state vote one way that's the way the electorial vote should go
27:27
you know I it's some ways I totally get what you're saying because you know as you mentioned most other states work
27:32
like this right but one of the reasons you know Nebraska shifted to this was to give people more diversity of voices and
27:39
a chance to actually affect the election on both sides in advocating for it to return to win or take all is there any
27:46
part of you that feels like uncomfortable with the fact that that would be removing maybe people's voice
27:51
and ability to effect the election no not at all why
27:57
not but you ask me if I feel that way I don't feel that way if the vast majority
28:02
of the state voters vote one way then I think the whole state should be the same
28:08
so I'm totally in favor of WTA and and I'm not taking into consideration that
28:13
it's not considering those other votes I think the majority rules I get what you're saying in terms
28:20
of like the proportional vote in the Electoral College causes an artificial sense of power from the minority I guess
28:27
I'm saying isn't that how some folks argue government should work like people
28:32
in the minority should also get to have voice I guess I'm saying does that come into your perspective in any in any way
28:37
yeah yeah yeah they have their voice and once you've shared your opinion and then we vote and then the majority
28:44
rules that's just that's plain and simple no I you know those may be your
28:49
opinions you ask what mine was mine is what I said it was no I change cool I I I only asked to get to push to Clarity
28:55
so you've been clear and I appreciate your time on that what was your reaction when you heard Charlie Kirk and Donald
29:01
Trump weigh in on this issue last week well I thought it was appropriate I I think the issue is this if if we come
29:09
down to Nebraska's one electorial vote deciding the issue we got greater problems in WTA and Nebraska what do you
29:16
mean can you be more specific well I mean if Donald Trump doesn't win this thing hands down with a guy like sloppy
29:22
joe I don't know if we'll ever get a fair and crew election again it's
29:28
obvious that the country is going the wrong way and anybody with any kind of common sense at all would say that they
29:34
agree with me I don't know how anybody in the right mind could vote for another four years of Joe Biden and so that's my
29:41
situation that's my opinion is if it comes down to this one electoral vote we
29:46
got far greater problems in this country than I thought because people don't understand the reality of what's happening so if you're Charlie Kirk or
29:53
president trump it seems like the pressure point now is the the special session yeah well here's what I think happens
30:00
all right I think this publicity that they're giving to WTA is important in
30:07
this regard because if we have a special TCH the education process and the
30:12
information that they're going to distribute is important and so consequently when they come and they
30:18
talk about the reasons why we need WTA all of a sudden that becomes front
30:23
and foremost in people's minds and if we get ready to do a special session if that's what we do
30:28
that education or that publicity is not wasted it's very good information to have in the Public's view so that they
30:35
understand what we're trying to do so even though we may not get it in these last four days I think that still brings
30:41
it to the Forefront for people to consider why we're doing it you're saying it still pushes it into the Consciousness and for you you still
30:48
think that education's good yeah oh yeah yeah yeah thank you Senator I really
30:53
appreciate guy a guy tell me once I had a guy tell me once all publicity is good
30:58
publicity even bad publicity was that guy Donald Trump it sounds like him no
31:03
it was it was sad it was Ben so as of Wednesday morning plan a
31:11
for the Biden campaign to secure 2070 electoral votes is hanging on by a
31:17
thread Governor pillin is willing to call a special session if legislative leaders can deliver the necessary votes
31:25
meanwhile more and more Trump allies are joining Kirk's cause including Nebraska
31:30
Republican Don Bacon who represents the second congressional district and voiced his support this week the Republicans
31:38
aren't hiding it this effort is pure politics and the desire to help Trump in
31:44
November but considering Nebraska is the outlier and almost every other state
31:49
votes the same way this doesn't seem like another story of voter
31:54
disenfranchisement this seems more about the electoral system itself the small number of people in
32:00
Battleground States who get all the attention in presidential politics and
32:05
people like Diana and Ernie who once sought to expand that number because at least for now the
32:13
voters of Omaha are the outliers they have a real say in our presidential election and that's more
32:19
than most of [Music]
32:26
us
32:32
[Music] that's the runner for Thursday April
32:38
11th 2024 now the rundown in a video statement released on
32:44
Monday many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion
32:49
rights especially since I was proudly the person responsible for the ending of something that all legal Scholars both
32:57
sides want wanted and in fact demanded be ended row v Wade former president
33:04
Trump spoke about abortion rights my view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal
33:11
standpoint the states will determine by Vote or legislation or perhaps both and
33:16
whatever they decide must be the law of the land in this case the law of the
33:22
state his position that abortion should remain up to the individual states did
33:28
not go as far as some anti-abortion activist wanted since he did not express support for a federal abortion ban
33:35
however Trump has often made conflicting statements on the issue and of course he installed the Supreme Court judges and
33:42
made the overturning of row possible in the first place you must follow your heart of this issue but remember you
33:47
must also win elections to restore our culture and in fact to save our country
33:53
which is currently and very sadly a nation in Decline
33:58
on the same day hello Wisconsin hello hello hello while
34:06
campaigning in the key Battleground state today I'm proud to announce five
34:11
major actions to continue to relieve student debt from more than 30 million Americans President Biden announced a
34:16
student loan relief effort that would impact millions of Americans tens of millions of people's debt was literally
34:23
about to get cancelled but then some of my Republican friends and elected official offal and special interest sued
34:29
us and the Supreme Court blocked us but that didn't well that didn't stop us
34:35
this comes after his previous attempts to cancel student loans were styed by the Supreme Court there are 95 days to the
34:41
Republican National Convention 130 days till the Democratic National Convention and 208 days until the general election
