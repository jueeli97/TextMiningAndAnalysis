0:49
place Katherine is atherine thanks for having me Katherine is a writer and editor here at times opinion covering
0:55
politics in our political system RIT large I have to say what I love about 's writing is that she's great at capturing

sort of Shifting moods in our political life and I think that will be especially useful today so welcome to Catherine
1:09
that's nice thank you all right so um barring Health troubles or legal developments are acts of God um or
1:16
second thoughts it looks like we basically have our two general election
1:21
presidential candidates for the history Buffs out there first time since 1892 that we have two presidents a former and
1:28
a current facing off for the presidency can anyone name them quick was it Grover Cleveland yes and I
1:37
forgot who the other guy was Benjamin Harrison oh that's right yeah yes which I just learned this weekend teacher's
1:43
pet always knows the answer but he's the teacher well when you pose the question you better know the answer um we have
1:50
this Choice before us but it turns out there are a lot of people who are unhappy with this choice so today we're
1:56
going to talk about what happens to that chunk of the American electorate that for whatever disperate reasons just
2:02
can't stand either Trump or Biden where do they go what do they do do they vote for Biden vote for Trump a third party
2:10
come home to their party or stay home and not vote at all that is what we are going to explore today let's figure out
2:17
who these voters are how they might affect this election and the impact they might have in American politics even beyond that sound like a plan let's do
2:24
it all right gidy up right um let's start with that chunk of Voters who
2:29
opted for Nikki Haley in the Republican primary Katherine you spent a lot of
2:34
time covering Haley and her people who is the Haley voter the Haley voter is
The Haley voter
2:42
probably somebody who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and maybe they voted for Trump in 2016 or maybe they didn't vote
2:48
for anybody and then they actually voted for Biden a lot has happened in the last decade right turns out yeah and people
2:55
have responded to the changes to the changes yeah um that kind of voter tends to be more affluent tends to be more
3:02
Suburban tends to think Biden won the 2020 election which is a big dividing line in polling I saw that kind of
3:09
divide in South Carolina I went there twice to go to Haley events in February
3:14
I talked to some Haley voters at those events and obviously the people who go to events are pretty self- selecting
3:19
they're going to be people who like the candidate generally speak you know like the people I talked to mostly were like
3:25
they had voted for Nikki Haley twice as Governor I talked to a man who was wearing like Hospital scrubs and USC
3:30
Gamecocks gear and he had voted for Biden in 2020 and felt like if it came
3:36
down to Trump and Biden you would vote for Biden again but like he really actually wanted to vote for Republican
3:42
he would have been thrilled with Haley just having read your coverage and followed this a bit they stried me as
Normy Suburban
3:47
very kind of Normy like sort of Normy Suburban probably like mostly voted for
3:53
moderate Republicans and have found themselves uncomfortably voting for Democrats but
4:00
in some ways kind of under duress I mean the sort of prototype for this for me is my grandmother who became somewhat less
4:05
conservative over the course of her life and then ultimately when the 2016 election came along was like I can't you
4:11
know she didn't vote for Hillary but she couldn't vote for Trump and I don't know there's something just sort of like I don't know Presbyterian about uh about
4:18
her you know that I mean that's something Pew looks at actual regular
4:24
Church attending like Mainline Protestants really tend not to like Trump yeah yeah yeah Asos to
4:29
evangelicals who have really kind of gone all in for white evangelicals have gone all in for I mean Nikki voters tended to be more educated which is
4:36
increasingly the big dividing line in American politics if you have a college degree or not and those who fall you
4:44
know on the other side of the line are we in for Trump I think it's useful to think about what Nikki Haley is now
Nikki Haley
4:50
saying to her voters when she dropped out she gave this weird non-endorsement
4:56
she said it is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and Beyond it who did not support him and I
5:03
hope he does that at its best politics is about bringing people into your cause not turning them away so the headline
5:08
was like you know she declines to endorse Trump but it sounded like she was leaving herself a clear opening to
5:14
endorse him later on okay so the one thing a real source of frustration to me
5:20
personally is so much of the discourse around Haley was she wants to be VP we
5:27
can't support her because she might drop out and endorse Trump basically everybody else has endorsed Trump except
5:35
for Nikki Haley she could still do it and I completely agree that that was set up in such a way where she's allowing
5:42
herself to do that if she wants but we are like months past when she was supposed to do this and she hasn't yeah
Will they vote for Trump
5:50
I also wonder to what extent she's actually channeling something that like the point of view that she represents is
5:56
one that in the breach if push comes to shove that her politics is that she will vote for Trump and perhaps even endorse
6:03
Trump over voting for Biden which is you know it's a tell that there are all these issues of principle that matter
6:08
but that ultimately you know she is a Republican and as a republican will support the Republican nominee for
6:15
president and I sort of wonder about these Haley supporters are they are they really truly in their heart of hearts
6:21
Republicans who are going to come back to the fold or are they going to sit this one out or are they going to wander
6:28
across the aisle and and vote for I think many of them did vote for Biden in in 2020 and I think a big unanswered
6:34
question is will they do that again or choose some other path yeah and that was I mean that's clear in that it's one
6:40
poll but in this New York Times Sienna poll this month uh 64% of people who
6:46
said they would vote for Nikki Haley and Republican primary said they voted for Biden in 2020 which is very high I mean
New York Times Poll
6:52
if you talk to them at the events like in New Hampshire you know a ton of the people at the Haley events had vot Ved
6:59
for Biden these are not core Republican voters the Republican vase and hardcore
7:06
Republicans be even Beyond Trump's core loyalists are going to come home and
7:11
vote for the party we just watched Mitch McConnell who got the kicked out of
7:16
him by Trump for years and blamed Trump for January 6 just come out and endorse
7:23
him cuz that's what they do yeah but one thing that is real about this is 64% of
7:29
these people voted for Biden in 2020 they say and you know what Biden won the election last time Haley's voters
7:35
represent 3% of all registered voters it's not a huge group of people but the
7:40
margins on these things are so small now that people who kind of stopped voting Republican but in their heart of hearts
7:46
are like a little bit Republican but voted for Biden if they vote for Biden again I mean that actually is a big deal
7:52
in some places and when you're talking about an election that split this closely then that's why the Democrats
7:58
are sweating the third party candidates you know they got a war room set up for
8:03
for dealing with these folks they are not playing because a tiny shift in the
8:10
vote in say Michigan or you know one of the Swing states that matter can throw
8:16
this whatever team you usually vote for or whether you decide to just stay home
Uncommitted Voters
8:21
actually let's take a moment to look at that other side here for a second for the Democrats we might be seeing sort of
8:26
an inverse situation in which Biden is may be too moderate a candidate and that's a problem for the more
8:32
Progressive wing of the party in some State primar some progressives chose to vote uncommitted rather than vote for
8:38
Biden can someone walk us through who this group is and what their beef is with Joe Biden yeah I'm happy to give
8:44
that a try I mean look I think that right now what what is front and center with the sort of quote unquote
8:50
uncommitted vote is definitely Israel and Gaza the way that the Biden Administration and that Biden personally
8:55
has handled the crisis there I think has alienated a sign significant number of certainly young voters young Progressive
9:02
voters but it's been striking to me how the problem is not limited to Young Progressive voters and it's certainly not limited to arab-american voters who
9:08
helped push for you know basically Biden's margin of victory in 2020 in Michigan was you know a little more than
9:14
100,000 votes and the uncommitted vote in the primary was basically 100,000 votes which is a little bit scary so
9:21
that's one factor but I think a much bigger and scarier factor is something that was highlighted in a fascinating
9:28
piece that was in the times I think a couple of months ago which is about older black religious leaders pastors
9:35
saying you know look we're really really concerned and upset about Gaza so you know these are not kind of young fire
9:41
breathing progressives these are the the center of the of the historic black
9:47
church they're people of enormous moral Authority tremendous amount of influence so I think to me the emergence of that
9:53
group is a big part of the problem and then you have another factor which is these kind of people who think of
9:58
themselves as being broadly Progressive and on the left but have gone kind of cuckoo on issues of vaccines and covid
10:06
restrictions and things like that and so spending time as I do in in certain kind of you know crunchy Progressive readouts
10:13
like uh you know great barington Massachusetts and provinc town uh and so on you do see these RFK Jr like bumper
10:21
stickers and hats and things like that and you know partly maybe that's just a Massachusetts bias but I think that
10:27
there are a bunch of different parts of it and some of of them are quite fringy like the antia and you know the kind of
10:32
hard-left opponents of the policy on Palestine but some of them are actually much more mainstream I guess one thing
10:38
I'm wondering about is are the sort of uncommitted Biden Skeptics on the left
Uncommitted Biden Skeptics
10:44
more or less dogmatic than the Haley voter on the Republican side right I kind of imagine that Haley voters will
10:51
not not all but many will make their way back to Trump as I think Haley will as well but on the Biden side will the anti
10:59
Biden's actually be more likely to sit out or to you know protest vote in a way
11:05
I guess it depends on how well the Democrats do in motivating them I mean in general a lot of these folks who are
11:10
uncommitted are younger voters or voters of color which tend to be less likely to
11:16
turn out or harder to turn out anyway I mean these are the folks who don't turn out in midterms usually they have to
11:21
have a reason to turn out as opposed to just just kind of automatic so one question is can Democrats rally them
11:29
around say the abortion issue which has been extremely mobilizing for folks and
11:35
one of the things that you know looking at young voters young voters tend to turn out more because they have
11:40
something they care about as an issue they do not vote for parties they barely
11:45
vote for candidates because candidates are by definition complicated and flawed
11:51
but something like abortion is something that they can get very motivated about
11:56
whereas some of the Nicki voters especially in places like New Hampshire are just people who are registering a
12:04
protest vote and they are just like unhappy that they are once again faced
12:09
with these two old Coots you're not really supposed to have to do this once
12:15
you have dispatched a candidate like this you're not really supposed to have to face it again right in the next
12:20
election so they're unhappy about it so much of this just depends on factors that are out of control will Gaza be a
Negative Polarization
12:27
big factor I mean it depends is there going to be a durable ceasefire in the next couple of months and by the time
12:33
the election rolls around will that have been largely defanged as an issue and similarly on abortion if there's a
12:39
Supreme Court decision on myth of pyone that goes against the pro-choice movement that will be a huge galvanizing
12:45
Force so just broadly speaking I think that the negative polarization that
12:50
Trump seems to attract is the biggest driver of sort of people voting for
12:56
Biden at this stage so so that could only be a good one of the things that I'm very interested to see is how people
Trumps Return
13:02
respond once Trump is back in the spotlight a lot we have had some blessed
13:08
years where he has been mostly confined to truth social and his rallies or
13:14
whatever and he has not been in America's face to the same degree that he was and I think memory has softened
13:22
just how atrocious he can be and so once this race heats up if we see a lot of
13:29
him you know on TV and I doubt they'll have any debates but there will be other
13:35
opportunities the convention I'll be interested to see how that affects people well remember there will also be
13:41
ads I think the Biden Super PAC has reserved like $250 million in
13:46
advertising that'll start running later in the summer oh all the swing state voters are going to be so delighted
13:52
about I that I well one thing that I mean you know negative advertising really and I'm sure some of that advertising will be like you're welcome
13:58
America the INF but you know Niki Haley actually was was actually hurt in New Hampshire by
14:04
advertising about social security and it has been a long time since there have been negative ads running about Trump oh
14:10
yeah people voters complain about negative ads all the time but they're run because they work the entire Biden
Negative Ads
14:16
presidency has been a negative ad about Donald Trump yeah like I mean you think that but like honestly you got to flash
14:22
Those ads up no but think I mean think about like you I I was just reading um Frank for's book about Biden and when
14:29
they came up with the notion of like Ultra Maga as the way to attack Republicans in 2022 I mean like the the
14:36
raise on Detra of Biden's presidency and reelection has been about like you know I'm here standing in the breach
14:43
defending you from these forces even during the Biden presidency there's sort of an everpresent feeling to Donald
14:49
Trump okay when we come back from the break I want to talk about the people who say they won't vote for Trump or for
14:55
Biden and what all those non-committed voters could mean for this election we'll be right
15:01
[Music]
15:09
[Music]
Double Haters
15:27
back so we've talked about the anti-trump forces on the right the anti-biden forces on the left but
15:32
there's also the anti every ones the so-called double haters the people who really dislike both their choices and
15:38
say they don't want to vote for either candidate we had double haters in 2020 and they tended to ultimately break for
15:44
Biden but they were only about 5% of the electorate then and now it's more like 19% of people who say they dislike Trump
15:52
and dislike Biden so what do you make of these quote unquote double hater voters
15:58
hate is a strong word yes dislike let's say what's the other word they use no no voters can we go with that one instead
16:05
like double NOS you know what what I what I don't like about about the term is because hate and hater implies kind
16:11
of an irrational unthinking position and also one that can be dismissed oh like he's just a hater she's just a hater
16:18
hate like yeah it's just you can't do anything about it because Haters Gonna Hate live your life ignore the hater yeah yeah and and I think there are
16:24
perhaps entirely rational reasons to have misgivings about both of these these candidates I have misgivings about
16:30
both candidates and my misgivings about one exceed my misgivings about the other but you know Nikki Haley's a double
16:36
hater in in in January she told Dana B she told CNN that she finds them equally
16:41
bad she's like if either one of them was good I wouldn't be running they are equally bad Lisa marowski says she can't
16:47
vote for either one Lisa marowski is a double hater right like you know this this is not just sort of like some Vibe out in the world although look Lisa
Republicans
16:55
marowski and Nikki Haley are conservatives so they're not going to vote for a Democrat it's not like they
17:00
are the swing voter on the street so I mean they're not going to vote for Trump
17:06
because he's a threat to democracy but the fact that they both say they're not going to vote for the Democrat doesn't
17:12
surprise me you know Evan Osos uh recently wrote a piece for the New Yorker about Biden and in that piece
17:19
Biden's campaign chair J Ali Dylan basically says that it's possible
17:25
favorability has decoupled from the choices that people make about candidates seems somewhat accurate to
17:30
the situation that we're in where people make choices and they're not pleased with either of their options and they're but they still make them but they still
17:37
make them is that which is what grown-ups do incidentally when it comes to voting you don't have to
17:43
vote you don't need to love a candidate you vote for the candidate even if you don't love them but this is where I
17:48
think things get dicey and dangerous for Biden right I think that the constituencies that he's going to need
17:55
in order to get over the top this time around the risk is not that they're going to vote for Trump the risk is that
18:01
they're not going to show up they stay home I also broadly think one of the problems for Biden that's not aspects of
Bidens Problems
18:09
this are maybe his fault but some of it isn't is people's expectation was that
18:15
things would calm down while he was President they don't necessarily feel that way in part because there's two bad
18:23
conflicts taking place in the world there's also I mean Biden has some problems specific to younger groups of
18:30
people who might be trying to buy a car or a house and have rate issues that he doesn't totally have control over and
18:37
there's some of these things that are like aspects of chaos or frustration that are hard to break up and solve is
18:44
this what happens when you're president it's your fault what's going on in the world that's the responsibility you take
18:49
as president and last time around he didn't have a record and this time around he does and no matter what he has
18:55
done in this set or the other category he's not going to meet EXP expect and he can't control things like the war in
19:02
Gaza or the war in Ukraine and that does not rown to his benefit yeah I mean I
19:08
the flip of this is like for instance if the Supreme Court takes the regulations on mailing abortion drugs back to the
19:15
way they were in the 2000s that would have a very restrictive quality on abortion it's like the IVF ruling
19:20
recently some of these things definitely link link back to choices that Republicans made about nominations to
19:26
the Supreme Court ultimately um somebody who isn't particularly in politics said
19:32
to me before the midterms that they felt like January 6th and the Dos ruling were
19:39
really linked in their mind because they felt like to average people they were like what won't the Republicans do
19:46
they're like storming the capital they're like overturning roie Wade like what's going to happen next like I I
19:53
believe anything could happen now and that linkage ended up being quite Rel I
19:59
think to the 2022 midterm results and I don't think you can really discount that in terms of like other factors that
20:05
people don't have control over that like really are to the detriment of Republican prospects in an election I
Democracy
20:11
was talking to Eugene Daniels uh Politico um on Friday and he said basically that like dos and democracy is
20:19
the message that's the Biden message what's interesting about that is that they're both reactions they're they're
20:25
both like protective defensive positions you know versus what what uh they're
20:30
conservatives now like Nikki Haley voters no seriously when I was talking to people about the California Senate
20:37
primary where Adam shiff just trounced in the jungle primary they have you know all all against all doesn't matter your
20:44
party but the vice chair of the democratic party in California was saying that Progressive has come to mean
20:50
something along the lines of protecting what values and progress that we have
20:56
made it's you know having rolled back and losing your
21:04
democracy so yeah it really has with the Spectre of trump on the ballot it is
21:10
kind of a all hands on deck to just not have everything destroyed that they hold
21:16
dear so okay this is like talk about like a super bummer episode the um sweet
The Double Haters
21:23
it's not a good time I don't sorry what to tell you okay no but but let me let me let me let me propose something um
21:30
one thing I find interesting about these you know say the double haters you know is that if there's anything that people
21:35
can agree on about American politics today is that we're super polarized and our political divides kind of overpower
21:42
all our other identities you know religion culture economics class yet what I find interesting about the double
21:48
haters is that in a sense they are resisting these poles at least they
21:54
aren't defined by them it's not like they're in the mushy middle they have strong views and they even have you know
21:59
party identities this may be you know star eyed of me but is there like an independent streak in the existence of
22:07
these kind of Voters that I am wrong to find vaguely hopeful I I don't think so
The Independent Streak
22:14
I mean I think that there is a I have an allergy to the term common
22:20
sense because you know Common to whom um you know like you got a problem with Thomas Payne who's included in the
22:27
common but I I do think that there is this kind of broad American bias towards
22:34
what feels normal and what doesn't feel extreme and at the moment the Democratic
22:42
party under Joe Biden seems to be sort of channeling something closer to what that might be for the middle um of of
22:49
our political Spectrum I think that that's where the sort of like the least weird ideas are coming from so yeah I I
22:56
I don't know I mean I think there is a craving for but we don't have a political system that seems to be able to deliver it so Carlos my question is
The Independent Swing Voter
23:04
are you talking about the independent streak and the people who are running or the people who are voting I mean voters
23:11
who don't feel compelled to to align okay that's what I want to take apart no
23:17
go for it if you look back and we're talking decades because I've been doing this for too long the idea that there is
23:23
this great thoughtful independent swing voter is largely bunk
23:29
there are a huge chunk of people who don't like to affiliate with the parties because they have this idea that you
23:37
know it makes them seem less beholden to or less kind of neure voting but in
23:44
general most of those voters lean strongly one way and go that way there
23:50
is a small chunk of people in the middle who really do swing overwhelmingly those people are
23:57
not more thoughtful than they are less informed if you talk to the folks who study these voters overwhelmingly
24:03
Through The Years these folks just don't really pay attention to politics and they say
24:10
things like I don't vote for the party I vote for the person and they do this in
24:15
presidential elections particularly because we have this weird relationship
24:22
with the president it's all about character it's all about the individual
24:27
now I think with Trump you really do have a character who has so trashed the
24:34
system and has so destroyed Norms that I think it's completely different so
24:40
that's a long way of saying usually it's complete garbage with a character like
24:47
trump it makes a little bit of sense this time around so there you go that's
24:52
my skunk at the Garden Party well I mean I do think unhappiness is like unpredictable it's hard to know what the
24:59
elector will be this year because of different displeasures people have with like the way things are but I mean if
25:07
you talk to people who are unhappy with Biden's policy on Israel often not
25:13
always but often it is like pretty well thought out but we're not yeah we're not talking about people who are mad about a
25:19
particular policy we're talking about the people who are usually people who are mad right now voter and I will be
25:25
interested to see these these folks aren't going to swing and vot for Trump they're not swing voters they're just going to stay home right well but that's
25:32
you know but that's different though that's that's not the people who are voting for them because of their personality they may do a protest vote
25:38
and stay home but that's not the same thing as swinging between the voters or being Independents or undecided yeah
25:44
sure I agree well double haters aren't swing voters we shouldn't equate those things yeah well the other thing I was
The Haley Effect
25:49
just going to say is that the Haley thing was interesting to me to go to her events in South Carolina and a little
25:55
bit of this in Iowa as well if you talk to anti-trump never Trump people who are
26:03
in Media or politics they often have like extremely conflicted feelings about everything because a lot of their life
26:09
is was built around being conservative and now that's been Complicated by these things and some of them felt like well
26:16
Haley hasn't been critical enough of trump and what would it mean for me to support somebody who might not win and
26:22
you know then I was like at these events in South Carolina where it was just like pretty clear that people are just like
26:28
yeah I I like her I really don't like Trump I want a choice it was uncomplicated it was straightforward the
26:35
events were like pretty cheerful and upbeat even though everybody knew the way this was going to go which was she was going to lose it was kind of this
26:42
interesting side by side of people just being pretty straightforward and common sensical if you will where I just like
26:48
I'll allow it yeah was just like ah if you live in DC or New York and you are or were consider
26:56
yourself conservative and you don't like Trump you you know people who also don't like Trump but if you live in Columbia
27:03
South Carolina how often do you get like a positive way to express that you don't
27:08
like trump it doesn't come around all that often I think one thing that you know when we' talked about this in this conversation already like these are very
Building a New Coalition
27:16
well-known quantities right like we know a lot about Joe Biden and we know a lot about Donald Trump they're two old Coots
27:22
as we've been saying and think about when you get excited or when people get excited about elections it's when
27:28
there's somebody who's representing something different and new and the
27:33
successful versions of this tell a story that builds a new Coalition you know
27:39
Ronald Reagan built a new Coalition um Barack Obama Barack Obama I mean the you know huge people got excited about Bill
27:45
Clinton people got excited about Bill Clinton he built a new Coalition and I think that this is not the moment that
27:51
we're living in right now we don't have any candidate who is coming to the four and saying here's how I'm going to build
27:57
a new Coalition actually I don't think that Trump has been able to build a new Coalition in the same way that those
28:03
other presidents have because he never won the popular vote so he has built a coalition but it's not a winning
28:09
National Coalition it was able to win via the electoral college but it's it's nowhere near the kind of achievement
28:15
that those other presidents have had and so I think that there is a sense in which like our politics feel so
28:20
depressing right now because we we just don't we don't have a new story you know and not to be nasty but we are at a
Depressing Politics
28:26
moment where people who do pay attention to politics like reporters and the chattering class are tired of feeling
28:35
like the older generation has clogged up the pipes for a really long time this goes well beyond the presidential race
28:41
people were super frustrated that Diane Feinstein God Rest her soul stayed in
28:47
that job P long past the point where she should have as senator they were also
28:53
frustrated that Nancy Pelosi Stanny Hoyer CL up the top of the house
28:59
Democratic Leadership for decades where like younger generation members were leaving now they have stepped aside so
29:06
these things are starting to move but you are at this point where it's not just the fact that we can't get someone
29:13
under the age of a thousand to run for president and be taken seriously it's
29:18
kind of extending to the broader political gerontocracy that people are tired of with you know Lydia's call for
29:27
um a new coalition and Michelle's um out with the old Vibe here I think that you
29:33
know maybe there's something we can hang our hats on Hope Springs Eternal in politics as in life eternal
29:39
disappointment um all right let's uh let's leave it there Katherine Miller

mid-century modern furniture M yes and careful listeners to this podcast have
30:32
grown weary of hearing about The Saga of me moving to a new apartment more I more
30:39

30:46
on a quest to find a new couch and you guys this look I think is something that
30:52

31:33

31:50
comfortable not too expensive unusual couch that doesn't look like the same couch that every single person that I
31:57

32:03
