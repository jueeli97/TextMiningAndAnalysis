How Does Trumpâ€™s Violent Rhetoric End?


0:00
I I did recently read a great book on the history of the AR-15 oh it is really good that's the that's by like those two
0:06
author the two co-authors right course you read it don't bring up books with Carlos in the room but did not win Jamal
0:12
reads more than I do have you you read his columns I can't believe I've been left with you too
0:18
sorry from New York Times opinion I'm Carlos loada I'm Michelle CLE and this
0:23
is matter of opinion where thoughts are allowed no yes they're allowed
0:29
[Music]
0:40
so Ross is traveling this week and Lydia is currently on the Columbia University
0:45
campus reporting on the protest there as we're recording this so we'll have more
0:50
on that subject soon but in their place doing double duty is our colleague Jamal
0:56
Buie who we've been wanting to have on for a long time welcome Jam welcome uh thank you guys for having me excellent
1:02
you didn't know you'd be doing such hard labor today double duty sorry double duty um so today we're going to talk
1:08
about I don't know maybe maybe a little bit of a grim subject but it's one we've been meeting to discuss for a while and
1:14
that is the prospect of and the reality of political violence in the United States now it's not a new story for
1:22
America we've had domestic terrorism political assassinations even a civil war but there are a few reasons I want to talk about this now first polling
1:29
shows that there's a chunk of Americans who seem willing to justify violence as a tool of politics a recent PBS NewsHour
1:36
NPR Marist poll shows that about one in five Americans believe that violence can
1:42
be a solution to the country's problems this view is also especially prevalent among those who believe the 2020
1:47
election was stolen and one more reason to talk about this is that the number one movie in
1:53
America right now happens to be a dystopia about a modern-day Civil War in the United States which Carlos and I saw
2:00
together yes yes yes not not just the two of us that would be weird we saw it with with other colleagues um and this
2:07
is actually another reason we're so psyched to have Jamal on today because in addition to being a history buff and
2:13
a student of eras of political violence he's also a movie guy so the movie is
2:18
actually a good way for us to ease into this conversation a bit I'd like to know kind of what you all made of it Michelle
2:25
can you give us a quick and dirty a quick and violent synopsis of of the story I prefer quick and dirty but okay
2:32
so the movie plops you into the end of a full-blown Civil War in which Breakaway factions of American states are battling
2:39
an authoritarian US Government the heroes hilariously are a handful of journalists led by a Veteran War
2:46
photographer played by Kirsten dun who are trying to get from Brooklyn down to Washington DC where they're hoping to
2:52
score a final interview with the president before the capital Falls so
2:58
basically this is a road trip from Hell movie with the sort of post-apocalyptic landscape like you've SE in zombie
3:05
movies highways clogged with abandoned cars roving militias refugee camps and
3:11
just violence everywhere one of its most notable features which has gotten a lot of attention is that writer director
3:17
Alex Garland expressly avoids getting political you don't get any backstory about how or why the war started you're
3:25
just there boom in the middle of all the blood Jamal what you think of it so I
3:30
first of all I live in Charlottesville Virginia and I watched this movie at a screening in Charlottesville and it was
3:36
a very strange experience watching it knowing that first the critical part of
3:41
the film is that the characters are going to Charlottesville for reasons that the front is where the front the
3:47
front lines are and there's one particular scene that my understanding is that it takes place basically 20 or
3:54
30 minutes outside of Charlottesville specifically off of Route 20 and so it was just like weird knowing you know
4:00
watch theie be like oh a bunch of this takes place you know in my in my neighor neighborhood uh and it was it was very
4:07
weird no so I you know I I saw the movie and I immediately vibed with Garland's
4:13
decision to basically not I wouldn't say the movie is not political but to remove
4:18
any sort of like Contemporary American politics from the film um I I like that
4:25
approach because I think it allows the movie to zero in on what I think it's actually about which isn't so much you
4:33
know our Americans on the verge of a civil war but like what would it actually be like to express the sort of
4:41
desires for violence that are prevalent among Americans today like transposing
4:47
images and events from like conflicts around the world things that are happening like now to American soil and
4:54
saying essentially like here's what it would mean for Americans to actually flict this kind of like violence on each
5:03
other um so yeah I was like totally I was totally in for it I was also like
5:08
very shaken up and unsettled by it and afterwards I had to like go over to Trader Joe's to pick up snacks for a road trip and I was like staring at a
5:15
box a crackers for a sec and I was like I was like What If This Were bombed out I hope your road trip Jamal was a
5:22
little more chill than the than the road trip in in the movie in so far that a road trip with a 5-year-old and
5:28
three-year-old can be chill actually that's a lot that's a lot like a war yeah I I'm with you in the sense
5:35
that I I also appreciated the decision by Alex Garland who's the the writer and
5:41
director of of the movie to not sort of like do a lot of didactic explanatory
5:48
backstory of like you know how we got into this war he just kind of places you
5:54
in the middle Actually I don't even know you said Michelle it was the tailand I have no idea if it's the tailand or or
5:59
the middle because even though there seems to be a big you knowers at the end a significant thing
6:07
happens um you could easily see the war continuing in all sorts of ways I thought even though there is a certain
6:14
ER of finality to the conclusion what I like is that the real sort of dilemma or the real question you're left with is
6:19
like how people deal with it there people who side with the secessionists in this story um or with the president
6:27
or the the militia groups that pop up everywhere I was especially taken by this is not too much of a spoiler by the
6:33
people who don't take sides at all people just trying to sit out the war
6:39
and to me that felt incredibly believable you know there there's a great moment in the movie when after the
6:44
journalists who are the protagonists here have witnessed some some really bad stuff they happen upon this town that
6:51
seems completely separate from it all like there kids playing in The Yards the sprinklers are going in the yards the
6:58
the shops are open and this reminds me that of course you don't need an entire
7:03
country to take sides for there to be a conflict for there be political violence you just sometimes all you need is a
7:09
zealous minority and an indifferent or fearful majority to experience serious
7:15
levels of of violence so to me the politics was less about how it all started and more about how we all deal
7:22
with it well one of the things that the movie made me think of is like this scenario is actually not what I worry
7:28
about I I do tend to think that you need some kind of extraordinary circumstance
7:35
like for instance the pandemic in order to jar people enough to change their
7:41
theoretical musings about violence being needed to action but what I think is
7:48
happening uh increasingly frequently is kind of these pockets of political
7:54
violence and enough political threats to skew how our government operates I mean
8:00
whether you're talking about an individual getting his rifle and and trying to go assassinate one particular
8:07
official or if you're talking about like election officials getting enough threats that nobody wants to serve in
8:13
that job anymore that's the kind of thing that I think is pretty much
8:18
already a problem that we're dealing with yeah and I mean we've seen it right this all reminds me um of a moment in
8:25
Liz Cheney's book where she um she's talking about uh precisely this
8:32
this notion that members of Congress are too afraid sometimes to do their jobs here let me let me dig up the page um
8:39
this is when the debate over Trump's second impeachment was raging and she says one concern I heard repeatedly was
8:45
this members believed Trump should be impeached but they feared a vote for impeachment would put them and their families in danger we were now entering
8:52
territory with the threat of violence was affecting how members voted preventing them from voting to impeach the president who had already unleashed
8:58
the violence the threats were real they were coming in the forms of calls voicemails social media posts text messages letters to members offices and
9:05
homes um she says that when one member told her that I'm afraid it will put my wife and new baby in danger she said I
9:12
understood his fear but I also thought perhaps you need another job oh yeah see your point Michelle um we are I think
9:21
living through an era of relative to US History historically low political
9:28
violence there have not been major assassination attempts or an
9:34
assassination of a president there have not been Mass violent Riots of the kind
9:41
that characterized 19th century American politics um we are not living in an age
9:46
of mass vigilante violence that characterize you know United States
9:52
through a large trunk of the 20th century and certainly the everyday violence of the Jim Crow South political
9:59
violence and otherwise is like not a part of our lives today and so I think
10:05
this creates in a funny way this kind of creates the sense that well if political violence were to return it would be
10:12
something catastrophic but I think like like you Michelle I think if we were to
10:17
see an upswing like a real upswing it would just a look like what most of
10:22
American history looked like which is like in the absence of strong Federal Authority lots of just like local
10:32
violence vigilantism political suppression that to me seems much more akin to what we
10:39
might may experience than you know like a war like scenario I guess I'm curious
10:46
to see what you guys think like Jamal makes a persuasive case that we're sort of at historically low levels of political violence given the conditions
10:53
in the country now how concerned are you of this breaking out in a significant way
11:01
concern isn't really sort of like how I conceptualize it it's just sort of like okay what is the likelihood that
11:07
violence against Congress people or people you know I just evolve the political process is going to erupt and
11:13
I'd say that the likelihood is like pretty decent that there is going to be some forms of violence I don't
11:20
necessarily think it's going to be organized I think it's going to be like much more uh much more are you looking
11:25
for lone Nutters yeah I mean I think I think lone Nutter I worry a lot about lone Nutters is much more likely than
11:33
any kind of like truly organized violence like to give an example what I
11:39
mean by organized during the 1870s in Mississippi there were groups um not the
11:46
clan the clan by this point had been like dismantled but sort of groups who called themselves like wh line Democrats
11:51
meaning that they were going to vote for white control of the state that were like actually organized into
11:57
paramilitaries that assaulted like polling places that you know in one instance like set up a cannon um with
12:04
its site on a polling place predominantly used by African-American voters like really organized to either
12:11
intimidate Republican voters in the state or outright try to kill them to
12:16
prevent them from casting their ballots that kind of violence I don't really see
12:21
I'm not worried about that returning um that's why I I I do find myself always
12:27
emphasizing that like yeah yeah I mean the polarization is bad now you know the the threats of political violence are
12:32
bad these are things you don't want in your Society but at the same time
12:38
American history American society has historically been extremely fractious
12:43
and on edge and to the extent that it seems more so than in the past I think
12:49
it has a lot to do with the fact that we can all see each other in a way that you couldn't 50 years ago right like the
12:56
existence of national modes of communication it so that like all the things about each other that we hate are
13:04
unavoidable uh so that I think that that has has an impact making the
13:09
polarization and such seem way worse but I be honest I'm not quite sure that it
13:15
actually is thank you I want somebody who's going to support my like this is
13:21
not the worst period in American history position I understand there are scary
13:27
things and bad things and stressful things but the idea that this is kind of
13:34
like an unusually fraught terrifying moment just doesn't really work for me I mean there
13:40
were thousands of bombings you know during a period of like the late 60s or
13:45
whatever yeah not to mention multiple political assassinations in in Rapid
13:51
succession but I mean there's a lot of room between a country we would want and the
13:58
worst period of violence ever I mean I'll be the gullible member of this
14:03
podcast for a moment like I don't believe that whether you call it a civil war or you know sustained heavy conflict
14:11
in the United States is impossible or is inconceivable and I think that
14:17
having maybe for me just like I I lived through a sort of steadily escalating um
14:24
Civil War or or dirty war during my middle school and high school years in in Peru and that makes me just more
14:31
inclined to imagine that really terrible things can happen and part of it is that
14:37
I didn't even think of it as a civil war
14:42
like that was a way that we kind of defined it almost after the fact we realized that's what we had been through
14:47
I was like those people in that town right I was just trying to sort of like you know live my life amid like curfews
14:54
and occasional car bombs and blackouts you know um and so I realize that
15:01
sometimes you only Define it in hindsight you realize what you went through after you went through it I
15:07
still didn't I mean 911 broke a seal for me in terms of what I thought would happen in my adopted country January 6
15:14
broke another one so I guess I don't see this as an impossible outcome even if I am persuaded by both of you to not like
15:22
lose my over it um you know I I I should say I do think that the United States
15:29
has experienced sort of a set of political ruptures over the past couple years and that there are real threats to
15:36
what we understand to be American democracy um I think my view is that
15:44
I how far do those threats become kind of explicitly violent I'm not so certain
15:52
um are there are there moments like spasms of violence that then like kind of Peter themselves out you know perhaps
15:59
but I I you know I I do think that there are reasons to worry about like the near
16:04
future of American politics and like the Integrity of constitutional government in this country yeah I mean I was at the
16:11
Trump rally that was in Schnecksville Pennsylvania recently and I was talking to these two women in line you know like
16:19
middle-aged women could have been my friends could have been my aunts whatever and they were 100% convinced
16:26
that the election is going to be cancelled they are convinced vinced that all those people coming over the Border
16:32
are military AED men and that there are behind the scenes plots going on they
16:37
are just waiting for this to strike but you know what they are not going to go out and riot in the
16:44
streets when that doesn't happen or like they are convinced that somebody is coming for them and obviously this is
16:50
kind of an extreme view but like Americans have been told that the you
16:55
know democracy is on the line and that like the the other team is coming for them and Horrors await they've been
17:03
taught to fear but that doesn't mean that they're raring up to you know grab their stockpile of weapons and take to
17:09
the streets but people do see also I think like spectacular acts of of
17:16
violence and and I mean you know the the Walmart shooting in El Paso uh in 2019
17:21
targeting Latinos the the the Pittsburgh shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue targeting Jews and whether we think of
17:29
this as as political violence in the same way that assassinating a governor
17:34
or a president or kidnapping a governor uh would be it is certainly violence
17:40
with a strong political Edge you know the perpetrators of of these attacks
17:45
often leave a trail uh of breadcrumbs or manifestos that show their Clear
17:51
Politics yeah and and you know I'm happy to have an entire week of episodes on
17:56
America's gun culture but you know that's for another
18:02
day let's take a break when we come back we'll look more at this moment and what we think Donald Trump's role in it might
18:09
be [Music]
18:30
I want to get back to Jamal's perspectives on the history of of political violence in America and I
18:37
found this clip from Nixon in 68 a a campaign ad where he explicitly sort of
18:44
brought up the the Spectre of violence as a campaign tool it it was a series of like you know rapid fire staccato images
18:50
of protests of you know bloodied people law enforcement um and a very sort of ominous
18:56
background it is time for an honest look at the problem of order in the United
19:02
States dissent is a necessary ingredient of change but in a system of government
19:08
that provides for peaceful change there is no cause that justifies resort to violence let us recognize that the first
19:15
Civil Right of every American is to be free from domestic violence so I pledge
19:21
to you we shall have order in the United States ah the good old days when the uh
19:27
there you go president was calling for not violence law in order but so what do
19:33
you guys make of that because there I mean there's there's political violence there's violence that is
19:38
politicized and then there's the politicizing of violence for electoral ends right when when you hear that what
19:44
do you what do you make of it what do I make of it I I I I make of it I I feel like I'm I'm
19:51
selling very short of like oh you know no bigy here nothing to see here nothing to see here move along because I just
19:57
think if it like like this is what American political appeals look like I mean this is the kind of this you know
20:05
elect me or people will get hurt kind of thing either out outside of my control
20:11
because you know we live in a lawless country or maybe because of putting me into Power um that's not an unusual
20:19
political appeal in in the history of American politics um and this promise to
20:26
bring order to an unruly Society is like a recurring one especially among
20:31
right conservative um conservative political movements so I hear this and
20:37
obviously because it's Nixon and Nixon you know not not blessed with the kind of voice you want to listen to all the
20:42
time um it sounds quite ominous but the substance of it seems almost like
20:49
typical so I have a more specific question for you Jamal so Trump gets out there and whether he's doing it to rile
20:57
up his base or to spur them to do something or if he's just trying to terrify them about what would happen if
21:03
Democrats take over I mean he he plays the whole oh if I lose there's going to
21:08
be chaos and you know BL Madness and the blood bath however you want to translate
21:14
that one but um that approach Works in part because he is fairly charismatic
21:20
figure but like do you see it as something that will carry over we always talk a lot about will trumpism Outlast
21:27
Trump but like this kind of assination with violence and bloodshed and Chaos in
21:32
particular yeah that's a great question I mean to the extent that trumpism or the magga movement or something kind of
21:39
remains like a part of American politics going forward you know let's say you know Trump loses this November and
21:45
decides to leave politics or more likely just ends up in jail um I don't think he's ever leaving
21:52
um you know I I would expect that this sort of language this way of approaching
21:58
Poli is going to remain um the explicitness of it which is I think the distinctive thing it's one thing to be
22:04
Nixon alluding to chaos and disorder it's something actually quite different to to say like these are my enemies do
22:10
violence to them um I go back and forth over whether I think any other person
22:15
can pick up any other person who is currently in Republican politics can
22:21
pick up on Trump's whole deal because I'm of the view that you cannot separate
22:27
Trump's appeal from basically the fact that for the previous you know four
22:32
Decades of his life he was a celebrity Entertainer like I think that the the
22:38
language the the Illusions to chaos and violence and disorder and all these things are perceived at least by some
22:46
portion of his supporters as basically being akin to like you know the
22:53
performance of like professional wrestling something that to RI you up but not to be taken so seriously
22:59
um and so I mean the problem right is that like people do will take it seriously because uh president took it
23:05
seriously on January 6 for right right people when you're in a position of power like Trump the words you use
23:11
actually matter a great deal and do shape how people understand their world but Trump is like uniquely able to play
23:18
this sort of like double game of I'm serious but I'm not I'm not sure if
23:24
anyone else can necessarily do that like we saw Ron de santis try to like capture the Trump energy but he couldn't you
23:30
know part of that are his own deficiencies part of that is that when you ship away the Entertainer part from
23:35
it it does I mean it sounds unhinged as Entertainer saying it but it hits a very
23:42
different register when it's not coming from Trump we saw this in 2022 with like Blake Masters in Arizona the the Senate
23:48
candidate oh he came across this like weird and dark right exactly it comes across as weird and dark when you're not
23:55
a guy who can make it seem a little goofy well that's the interesting thing right when and and wrestling is a great
24:01
metaphor because professional wrestling is both incredibly violent and Incredibly fake it's like it's the
24:07
performance of violence and in some ways I think that's
24:12
what Trump attempts to do rhetorically but the question is can you control it
24:19
once you unleash it and he's as much a follower of his base and his crowds than
24:28
he is a leader like the reason build the wall became such a mantra is because he
24:33
saw the crowds responding to it you know he tried other stuff and people didn't respond to it but people responded to
24:40
that so he went with it and so in that sense it's fascinating how the the
24:45
language of entertainment is violence and it's something that he capitalizes on but you know to the extent that he
24:53
can like turn it on and off like with a switch is not like I don't I don't necessarily see that lasting there's a
24:59
question of like could anyone else take up the Mantra of trumpism another
25:04
question is can anyone else turn it off yeah how does it end that's actually
25:11
a very interesting question there I mean it I I personally think it
25:17
ends when uh when Trump dies whenever that is everybody dies so you think it's
25:24
going to just keep running forever yes I joked earlier that I don't think he's leaving if loses and I I really mean
25:29
that quite seriously I think if Trump loses in November he IM and doesn't go to jail right isn't put in prison then
25:38
he immediately is the front runner for the 2028 Republican nomination so I'm interested in the um you know if he
25:44
loses if he wins like when it when it comes to this question of of political violence is there anything like as this
25:50
election gets closer that that worries you in this context of violence like
25:56
after 2020 we saw January 6 happening post election
26:02
and a lot of people are sort of thinking about that scenario like how do you deal with election certification after the
26:08
fact um are there things that concern you in the immediate short term in the
26:14
in the months leading up to November and the months leading up to an inauguration if you would have asked me
26:20
like two days ago I would have said you know is he going to try to disrupt his trials with Jan 6 energy right kind of
26:28
like summoning a mob to harass people but he tried that like this week and no
26:33
one no one came no one showed no one showed what happens when you summon a mob and no one shows up um won't be wild
26:40
yeah so that that makes you feel actually much better about the near future I you know I do think that in
26:46
terms of the election itself the one thing that I think is worth worrying about is if it ends up being extraordinarily close right sort of like
26:53
one state deciding who's going to be president then I think there's a chance you'll see like mini January 6th at you
27:00
know the the certification offices or whatever of whatever state that is if it's Arizona if it's Wisconsin North
27:07
Carolina um I think the narrower the margin of victory for for let's say it's
27:12
Biden the more likely there's an attempt to like physically disrupt the process
27:18
yeah I think that's totally true although I like to think that part of what happened in 2020 is just we got Gob
27:23
smacked we just had no idea that that sort of thing was possible and I think
27:29
pretty much everybody has put in place some kind of contingency plan for this I
27:35
mean like not just in DC I mean my guess is that out in the state you know if
27:40
you've got people plotting to kidnap and assassinate Gretchen Whitmer I'm pretty sure Michigan has like now taken that
27:48
kind of thing seriously so one we won't have this crazy pandemic um unless bird
27:54
flu catches us anytime in the next few months you know but we won't have a crazy pandemic and two people are much
28:00
more on guard like you will you will see people prep for this oh boy um hears
28:06
from your lips to God's ears um all right I think we can probably um wrap up
28:13
here when we come back we will get hot or cold
28:22
[Music]
28:39
[Music] so we're back for the uninitiated this
28:44
is the part of the podcast where one of us share something that we're really into or not so much uh who's hot colding
28:52
today oh it's all on Jamal okay Jamal hazing it's you yeah it's me uh Carlos
28:58
at the start of our conversation you mentioned that I'm I'm a movie guy I do watch a lot of movies and I recently
29:04
watched a reissue of the Robert Longo film uh Johnny neonic not a good movie I
29:11
I got to be really clear about this it's not a very good movie it's very flawed
29:16
but in this reissue the movie was retooled to be black and white it wasn't
29:21
simply sort of like a a a desaturating they actually went through and completely converted the entire film to
29:28
black and white adjusting contrast adjusting highlights Shadows all that stuff to really make it sing and it
29:33
