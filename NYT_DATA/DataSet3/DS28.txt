Could Israel Cost Biden the Election?


0:00
so you know I always have to put my laptop like on top of a book to get like the best sort of like angle of the
0:07
camera and stuff and today in honor of our discussion I've got um Henry Kissinger years of renewal um is is
0:15
holding up the laptop for our foreign policy discussion my uh my wife is doing
0:20
an interview at our dining room table and she always in order to you know
0:26
create the illusion of professionalism has to have like 10 books under the
0:31
laptop to bring it up so she's got are they are they all yours Ross all all all
0:38
copies of Ross's books yeah she only reads my
0:45
books from New York Times opinion I'm Lydia pgreen I'm Michelle coddle I'm Ross D and I'm Carlos Lozada and this is
0:53
matter of
0:58
opinion this is the first episode of what I
Voters dont care about foreign policy
1:04
think will be a whole bunch I think we want to talk about what are the big issues and the big questions that are
1:09
going to be uh playing out in the election this year so I'm going to ask a question and want you guys to give me a
1:15
quick answer so who here stands by the truism that voters don't care about
1:21
foreign policy okay I am the one who's this is my Mantra but it's that always
1:26
say this Michelle voters don't vote on far policy it's different that's not
1:32
what she asked that's not what I asked a wrinkle but the thing is you said voters right didn't say just like Americans I
1:38
think part of the problem is calling it foreign policy it sounds so like rarified and Elite and that creates the
1:43
sense of distance but do people care about how America throws its weight around in the world do they care about threats to America emanating from around
1:50
the world I think I think they do if there are troops on the ground they do if there aren't they're not voting on it
Voters care about apparent disasters
1:56
Ross Way in here yeah I think it's a it's a 9010 thing 90% of the time which
2:02
is not bad for a truism right voters don't really care much about foreign policy but there is that crucial 10% of
2:09
the time under which I would include voters care about apparent disasters
2:15
like the Iran hostage crisis or I think the withdrawal from Afghanistan
2:21
genuinely hurt Joe Biden for a while and sort of changed perceptions of his presidency and voters care when America
2:29
or our allies and our allies is a sort of loose a loose category unstable and
2:35
shifting but when America and our allies seem to be under attack voters care about that yeah well I think we're going
2:41
to get into a lot of the the history and um and also the the the ways in which we
2:47
Define foreign policy you know is Shifting over time I wanted to talk about this because obviously the
2:54
situation in Israel and before that the the war in Ukraine which as it happens continues and continues to be a very big
3:00
deal because I actually I think that these Global entanglements uh May upend the usual consensus uh perhaps in
3:07
unexpected ways in this election year given the state of the world and it really seems tough to neatly divide
3:14
between the foreign and domestic like is the crisis in Israel and Gaza a foreign
3:19
story or a domestic story it's kind of both and it's percolating through in lots of different ways so let's start
3:25
with history um Carlos I'm going to turn to you Professor Lo do you think they are examples of places where foreign
3:33
policy has been like a make or break uh issue and and this is a bit of a gim because I think like your favorite topic
3:39
Jimmy Carter is like a wonderful example of this but but maybe you have your opportunity to talk about Carter Carter
3:46
you know I was reading Carter's 15th Memoir and I remember yeah um well I
3:51
mean like the the Iran hostage crisis was was a drag on on Jimmy Carter's re-election prospects not the only drag
Iran hostage crisis
3:58
that there were many um but it but it mattered and certainly he thought it mattered uh when he when he looked back
4:03
on it um one that we sometimes forget because he you know he didn't you know he was never president he didn't win but
4:09
like Ross perau challenge for the presidency in the 90s you know was premised in Parton's opposition to NAFTA
4:15
right yep and he didn't win a single state but he won like close to 19% of the national vote um in '92 and it was
4:23
you know that was a foreign policy issue though one clearly with a lot of domestic implications you know the great sucking sound of jobs as he as he put it
4:30
um it's not always negative though like George W Bush's 2004 reelection campaign
4:36
was overwhelmingly all about 911 um you know even even though like the attack
4:42
happened on his watch and you know he was running against an actual veteran in John krey but if you remember the
4:47
Republican convention in ' 04 since I'm an old man I remember it well it was just like every other word was nine and
4:54
then the other word was 11 um so you know these are moments when it matters I mean one one way that I find interesting
5:00
is when it affects not just who wins an election but it affects who the nominees are right like LBJ couldn't bring the
5:07
party together over Vietnam so he didn't run you know for reelection and um George HW Bush looked unbeatable after
5:14
the Gulf War so some of the bigname Democrats opted not to run against him right thinking he just there was no they
5:20
had no shots so that's that opened the door for Bill Clinton Obama became the nominee in 08 in a significant part I
5:26
think because he could point to this long ago speech in which he had called
5:32
Iraq a dumb War as opposed to all the other Democrats who had reluctantly or not supported it and and then you know
5:38
and of course he ran against John McCain who had supported the war um so I think there's plenty of ways in which it
5:43
matters not just to who wins elections but to even who who gets nominated for the presidency totally and I mean I
5:49
think you know John krey being a veteran was you know supposed to be a selling point in 2004 reporting for Duty how he
5:56
started he started his speech yeah until got he got Swift booted and then it turned out he was a complete dork who
Foreign policy doesnt matter
6:03
couldn't relate to the American public cuz he would go wind surfing and then that was all shro it didn't matter what
6:08
he had done in the war I hear he knew some French well which is a problem let me let me let me speak up for John KY
6:15
though and also maybe maybe challenge Carlos's analysis a little bit because the people who say foreign policy
6:22
doesn't actually matter often will cite that 2004 election and say look we have
6:30
this whole sort of elite level journalistic discourse about you know krie was nominated to blunt Bush's
6:36
advantage on foreign policy and it didn't succeed because Bush actually won
6:42
um but if you look at you know the political scientists who try and create
6:47
you know estimates of what result you should expect from the economic fundamentals alone John KY actually
6:54
overperformed the fundamentals in 2004 based on economic growth rates sure
7:00
to well I'm just saying George W bush should have won should have won by more
7:05
which could be cited as proof that only Elites cared about foreign policy in that election or it could be cited as
7:11
proof that actually the carry stick was fairly effective it just wasn't effective enough to overcome Bush's
7:19
advantage on the economy which again is not how anyone remembers that election I I agree but that's what the economic
7:25
fundamentalists would say I mean it's interesting right because I think that the other question I have is like how do
7:30
you define what is a foreign issue and what is a domestic issue and you know I I have this theory that things that
7:36
happen abroad sort of take time to kind of percolate through the aquafer of American politics and become domestic
7:43
issues and I think like the Iraq War it just it took some time for like what was
7:49
happening over there to sort of fully work its way into our politics over here
7:54
um and I think one of the things that I'm wondering In This Moment is like has that time continuum actually collapsed
8:01
like you know obviously we're living in the latter days of globalization and the smaller world and all of that kind of
8:07
stuff but it does feel like you know things out there and things right here are collapsing into our politics in a
8:13
closer way and that's partly because of migration and okay I'm G to jump in here and start I'm I'm just trying to figure
8:18
out how to spell aquafer I'm just yeah I'm just like look I'm just looking it up sorry go ahead I'm going to draw the
8:24
distinction of with the Iraq War we had troops on the ground we had lots of troops on the ground we had troops on
The exception is Israel
8:29
the ground in Afghanistan we do not have troops on the ground right now so you can collapse all you want to but people
8:35
are not going to care about Ukraine the one situation that I think could be the
8:40
exception is Israel yeah the Gaza War has become a domestic policy issue that
8:46
is splitting along unusual political lines and I do think that Israel tends
8:52
to be unique but I think it is the exception to the rule yeah but I think
8:58
that there's something to this notion that um you know we expect a commanderin-chief to have a certain kind
9:04
of like I mean Ross flected this the the Afghanistan withdrawal moment for Biden I mean that was the moment when his
9:11
approval rating went negative and um it hasn't recovered since um why do you
9:16
think that was such a kind of hinge point for for the Biden presidency I mean I don't think we know for sure that
9:22
Biden's approval ratings wouldn't have started sinking without that right it it was an inflection point but I think you
9:28
know I think if you'd Flash Forward 6 months or a year and asked voters what they cared about and why they were down
9:33
on Joe Biden they would have mostly said inflation and gas prices right not Afghanistan and even when the Washington
9:40
Post published their version of the Pentagon papers as the Afghanistan papers showing sort of how you know
9:46
America's military and political leadership had sort of botched Afghanistan without admitting it for
9:51
years and years and years none of that made a huge difference politically what made a huge difference politically was
9:57
one things are going really bad Sly and two our soldiers are there I think a
10:03
question is whether social media in that creates that kind of immediacy that you're talking about Lydia for even for
10:11
crises that don't involve American troops directly that seemed to be true for at least for the beginning of the
10:17
Ukraine war American boots weren't on the ground but we had this kind of crazy
10:23
sort of transmission of not just images but video and you know sort of you could
10:28
watch the war unfold right and there's been versions of that with Israel and Gaza but I'm
10:35
less sure how much that changes American public opinion as opposed to like crazy
10:41
online discourse which are still overlapping but not completely the same thing I think there's another way in
10:48
which the withdrawal from Afghanistan has an impact whether it's it's sort of a a lasting enough impact to matter in
10:55
the in the election later this year I I don't know but the thing about the Afghanistan withdrawal is that in a way
11:01
it was sort of Biden decisiveness saying like this is never going to be good so we just have to get out um but it looked
11:07
like it sort of made him seem like he was not in control of a situation as you know the way it unfolded so chaotically
11:13
and so in that sense the way Biden ended up looking you know weakened his kind of
11:18
the overall perception of Voters who would care about foreign policy even in this kind of minimalist way if you
Biden vs Trump
11:24
listen to people on the campaign Trail talk about Biden versus Trump you'll get
11:30
a fair number of them that are like you know yes Trump is crazy he is bombastic
11:36
he is erratic he is unhinged but that's what we need in this scary time because
11:43
he's dealing with crazy people so it is Trump's projection of strength that these folks like even though they
11:50
acknowledge that it is not exactly a sort of balanced approach well and it's
11:56
interesting right because if you see the way the debate about UK Ukraine is playing out the Ukraine funding is playing out you know which is a sort of
12:02
classic foreign policy issue the tradeoff that is being pushed is explicitly like we don't want to fund
12:09
the war in Ukraine unless we like secure our Southern border and like which of those is a domestic issue and which of
12:15
those as a foreign issue you know I think most people would think of immigration as being largely a domestic issue but it's it's striking to me that
12:21
those are the those are the things that are being discussed I mean you know our our colleague Tom fredman argued this
12:26
week that you know funding the war in Ukraine with no cost of American troops is like the best security bargain and
12:32
that's sort of one perspective right but um but I think that there is like a very real discussion going on about you know
12:38
how we're spending money and I think that's a very politically potent question well Trump's republicanism is
12:44
very isolationist and that is one way that he is bashing Nikki Haley on the trail which is that she's a warmonger
12:49
she is the old school hawkish Republic Ian and Ross you you kind of have
What hurts presidents
12:56
sympathies in that direction I have some sympath I have some sympathy for that critique of Nikki Haley yeah I mean I I
13:01
think that the but to keep it on the you know what hurts presidents right I think
13:06
what unites the border and foreign policy is that they are areas where you can say
13:13
that presidents get punished by voters for a perception of the world being out of control yeah and I think this is
13:21
generally one of Biden's problems that even though the US and its allies have
13:26
done reasonably well in propping up Ukraine right that when you combine
13:32
Russia invading Ukraine with our Southern border is out of control with war in the Middle East and the Red Sea
13:38
shipping lanes are being closed and um Iran and Pakistan are firing missiles at
13:45
each other which maybe from a you know Grand strategy point of view doesn't matter to the US but adds to this sense
13:50
of a world where the Pax Americana is breaking down and so it's not even sort
13:56
of one discreet foreign policy crisis that's a problem it's the whole thing and this is where the sort of crude
14:03
heuristic of you know Donald Trump seems tough and Joe Biden doesn't can matter
14:09
politically because the reality is that a lot of these crises were not happening
14:14
during Trump's presidency which was chaotic in other ways but Putin invaded during Biden's presidency y Hamas
14:21
attacked during Biden's presidency and that's that I I think that is the kind of thing that voters pay attention to
14:27
and Trump explicitly claims credit for it not happening on his watch yep let's
14:33
leave it there but before we go to the break I want to read a listener email we got from Kevin Kevin writes Biden would
14:40
have more support if his foreign policies were as sensible and Humane as his domestic policies he should end our
14:46
war with Russia our Gaza genocide and our trade war with China Wow Let's
14:52
unpack that we'll be right [Music] back
14:59
[Music]
Kevins argument
15:10
and we're back so before we went to break we heard from Kevin who argued that Biden would have more support if
15:15
his foreign policy was more quote sensible and Humane unquote and so I
15:21
want to talk about Kevin's argument especially in light of another truism which is that when foreign policy does
15:26
factor into an election it typically favors the incumbent what do you guys think it depends on how things are going
15:32
I mean LBJ can tell you that it doesn't necessarily favor the incumbent um I
15:38
think what people tend to talk about is a rally around the flag effect which used to you know be assumed in these
15:44
situations if you're at War the country comes together they rally around um also there was the whole truism us politics
15:52
stop the's Edge stops at the water's edge that absolutely doesn't hold true anymore so I'm not sure that this one
16:00
seems to stick like it used to I think you can see in Kevin's email The Listener email that we read just before
Foreign policy crises
16:07
the break one of the reasons why the current set of foreign policy crises
16:13
doesn't help Joe Biden um because Kevin was basically arguing for a mix of
16:20
policies that could all be classified as sort of on the left in the sense of
16:25
being sort of you know anti-war anti- interven but that combination really doesn't map
16:32
on any sort of political consitency exactly you know well I mean know it
16:38
does it maps onto I I should say a small and specific part of the American left
16:44
but that is not that significant the sort of normal Democratic stance has been we should support Ukraine's war
16:51
with Russia they don't say our war with Russia um and then there's a kind of
16:58
bipar partisan consensus right now that we need to be tougher on China although
17:03
that has Critics on the left and on the center and then Gaza and Israel is the issue that just clearly divides Biden's
17:10
Coalition in big and important ways domestically and you know having an issue front and center that divides your
17:17
Coalition is just not helpful when you're running for re-election yeah I mean is a truism for you yeah I mean the
17:24
Israel Gaza situation does feel really different from most foreign policy issues and different from the way that
17:32
Israel issues have played out in in the past the thing about about the situation in Israel and in Gaza that I think is
17:38
specifically perilous for Joe Biden is that there's specific constituencies in
17:45
his uh Coalition that may just like not show up um because they're really angry
17:51
and upset about the way that that Joe Biden has um comported himself you know
17:57
I look at I look at at the State of Michigan Right which is always a Battleground State and is you know he won very very narrowly there is a
18:04
significant arab-american vote in uh Michigan that um you just seeing these interviews with Muslim voters in swing
18:11
States and saying like I've never in my life been a single-issue voter but now I a single-issue voter and this is my
18:16
issue um so I think it's you know yes it's foreign policy but it's clear that there are you know other voters who
18:22
really like Joe Biden's you know staunch support of Israel and that will politically be important for him but I
18:28
you think that in like very ways specific to this situation it's likely to play out domestically um in a what's
18:35
going to be a very close election I think you're totally right and it goes beyond even the Arab American Community
Black Lives Matter
18:40
I mean this has this has become a part of American culture wars you have
18:45
younger voters younger progressives in particular and again I have college students in you know a high school
18:51
senior and their friends and stuff they talk about this as a defining issue as
18:56
whether or not they support Joe Biden and it has become like a an international version of black lives
19:03
matter to some degree and in fact you see black lives matter and a lot of black activists aligning with the prop
19:10
Palestinian movement and turning it into a much bigger issue you know you get a
19:16
lot of talk about colonizers and oppressors and it has it has just kind of folded itself into other issues that
19:23
are really really hot button issues domestically I mean it toppled to College presidents you have University
19:30
presidents being calleded before Congress and run out for not being sufficiently hard on anti-Semitism on
19:36
their campuses theoretically so it it is spiraling although that's not why the Harvard president was it is exactly why
19:44
they went after her yeah but she she she survived that part of it she didn't survive the second part of it all right
19:50
we're going to do the Harvard episode we we can't sort of say it was because of Gaza like I mean I think but it was
19:55
because of Gaza that's started because no one would have even looked it anyway so two points here two points one is
The Left
20:01
that and this is sort of implicit in what you guys are saying but for for the left here the most likely scenario is
20:07
that this is about depressing Joe Biden's share of the vote right there is some talk where people are saying oh you
20:13
know Arab Americans might vote for Donald Trump um which I think there there's a version of reality you know
20:20
Earth 17 where that could happen I don't think Trump cares personally
20:25
particularly about the Israel Palestine conflict but I think the politics of it will just lead him to be sufficiently
20:32
pro-israel that what will end up happening is if there's a problem for Joe Biden it's a problem with voters
20:38
being disillusioned and staying home or in some cases with younger Progressive voters voting for Cornell West or Jill
20:46
Stein we just staying home too younger voters don't turn out right part of what I find interesting about this this part
20:52
of the debate is that it it to me it gets to the heart of what foreign policy is for what it's all about there are
20:59
people who see American foreign policy as mainly a means of National Security like protecting the American people from
21:05
foreign threats protecting your allies securing the Border controlling immigration you know in this world for
21:11
instance Ukraine doesn't matter right y um then there are Americans who see foreign policy mainly as a way to
21:18
project and spread American values or what they believe should be you know Bedrock American values and that's human
21:24
rights or Freedom or Prosperity you know in this world supporting ukine um can be urgent you know in this world you become
21:32
a single issue voter over over over what's happening in Gaza so it's not just like how people feel about this
21:39
part of the world or it's also what they think American power is for but
21:45
generally I think the second group tends to be much smaller than the first group
21:51
the kind of people who affirmatively care about using us power to shape
21:58
events in distant lands are a narrower you know they're a more Elite if we if
22:04
we will sort of or you know well-educated you know very politically
22:10
engaged group um whereas the group that are sort of natural
22:15
isolationist represents a much larger share of the country and I think what's happening in the Border debate is not
22:21
that people are you know have this sort of very literal-minded view of the federal budget where it's like we're
22:27
taking $5 from the border and spending $5 in Ukraine instead it's more of a sense of
22:33
like if we can't trust our leadership to you know take care of our own borders
22:40
why would we trust them when they go and make policy about Ukraine a subject
22:45
about which you know people don't care that much I think it's more about sort of the trust that is given to Elites
22:52
than like spending in dollars and cents per se although there is a strain of the Republican party that is is actually
22:58
making that I mean J Senator JD Vance is making that exact argument which is that they want to they want to spend that
23:04
money overseas instead of here at home it's it's a great political tool right but I I just think the money is not the
23:11
real issue I I agree there that that's the rhetoric but it's not about money it's about trust in money is is a very
23:17
is a very convenient uh you know unit of measurement right of like what matters to you right like yes it is my wife
23:26
overwhelmingly the unit of measure but it's like you know a budget is a moral document right like show me what
23:32
you spend money on and I'll show you what you care about um I mean I do think it is striking though that there have been and and maybe this is just recency
23:38
bias speaking but like you know there have been moments in American history we
23:44
collecting a coalition that believes in an idea of America as a kind of you know
23:51
to quota phrase City on the hill like a beacon of Freedom a you know that I think is an appeal that has been
23:58
meaningful to Americans in pretty large numbers it might not be the main motivating reason but I do think that
24:04
Americans want to think of America as being a strong virtuous country I mean
24:10
if not why would we be having these huge debates about you know American history and how we talk about America's slavery
24:16
and colonialism and all these kinds of things if if we didn't care about the you know sort of the fundamentally
24:22
virtuous way in which America is perceived in the world there's this peculiar thing where
Isolationism
24:28
Americans can be up for a kind of isolationism but it is a kind of city on
24:35
the hill isolationism it's like the world is bad and corrupt and we don't
24:40
want to mess with it and we don't want it to mess with us and we're just going to do our own thing I think what Americans don't like is a kind of real
24:48
politique sort of amoral Grand strategy when if Americans are going to be in the world we want to believe that we're
24:55
fighting for democracy otherwise we're just going to sort of pull back and do our own thing whereas a figure like
25:01
Henry Kissinger even though American Elites all sort of you know liked him and FedEd him till the end is I think
25:08
deeply out of step with the national character Americans don't want to hear arguments about like the balance of
25:14
power and things like that I and I don't want to be the world's policeman I mean this is what Trump hits on he's like we
25:20
don't need to be doing this NATO needs to step up Europe needs to step up this should not be our responsibility and in a sense this
25:27
collapse of the foreign and the domestic that we've talked about on on some of these
25:32
issues is part of the appeal I think of trumpism and and that he's pushing back
25:38
against it with this sort of nationalist populism like what what do what does he keep on saying if you if you don't have a border you don't have a country
25:43
anymore that that erosion of what we think of as as foreign and domestic between us and Them between there and
25:50
here um that's part of what trumpism is responding to and that's that's part of what he says in in blunt and sometimes
25:57
crude ways um in his campaign yeah but at the same time and I I agree with that
Nationalism
26:02
but there is also a kind of globalization of nationalist
26:07
anxiety yes irony Donald Trump succeeds in 2015 and 2016 in part because of
26:15
things like the Syrian migrant crisis in Europe and some of the Islamic States
26:20
terrorist attacks in Europe now obviously there were some terrorist attacks in the us too but I think the
26:26
shadow of Europe's challenge with migration and Europe's challenge with
26:32
radical Islam totally hung over us politics and especially conservative
26:37
Politics the time when Trump was coming on the scene and I think that Dynamic has sort of obviously continued in
26:43
various ways that you have a a globalization of culture wars over nationalism that's fascinating to watch
26:50
right and I think like you know in in some ways the sort of early early indicator was was brexit right I mean I
26:56
I remember seeing those results coming in and just you know thinking my God this thing that never seemed possible
27:01
was was possible and uh and you know I don't I don't know that it's particularly worked out very well but um
27:08
here we are um okay in 15 seconds or less each of you does foreign policy as
27:14
an issue favor Trump or Biden in this election I'm going with Trump people are feeling Surly about life and the world
27:21
in general and that tends to come back and bite the president on the butt H yeah I would I would agree I think the
Foreign Policy
27:28
the whole foreign policy favors the incumbent does not work this time around when people see sort of a a chaotic
27:34
World under Biden and a quote unquote strong leader under Donald Trump Ross I
27:40
I feel like I should be contrarian but I agree uh certainly I think right now if
27:45
the election were held right now uh the foreign policy landscape and the situation in the world would be one of
27:51
Trump's biggest assets um I think you could imagine events happening that
27:57
change that that do create a rally around the flag effect for Biden um but
28:02
right now what's been bad for the world is good for Trump's campaign well and and Trump has the great benefit of
28:09
having essentially no no track record uh to look back on here right I mean there was uh he was the president no no his
28:16
track record is the selling point yeah but he all the time that was not necessarily that was not his doing you
28:22
do not have to give Trump credit for anything that happened in his presidency to see that the world under Trump preo
28:29
and even during Co was not a time of major Warfare was more stable and in
28:34
better shape than the world is right now um I'm going to cheat on this question and say it depends on what happens
28:40
between now and November which actually actually is a very very long time no but
28:46
I mean it's a very long time and a lot can happen right I mean um eternity very
28:51
soon the election is very soon look at Ross all right guys let's leave it there
28:56
when we come back hot and [Music]
Movies
29:14
cold and finally it's time for hot cold and this week I'm going to be a dictator
29:20
and seize the hot cold for myself sorry guys so like a lot of people people um
29:28
during the era of peak TV I essentially like abandoned the movies and so this
29:34
year I've just like returned to the cinema with like a real Vengeance and it's just been such a delight and such a
29:40
pleasure and so when the Oscars were were announced um I was like astonished to see that for the first time in very
29:46
many years I'd actually seen the majority of the best picture nominees um seven out of 10 and not only that but I
29:55
actually would be kind of fine if any of of them won nice um so I'm just like
30:00
really hot on the movies like the movies are great and and and in particular I feel like there are a lot of really
30:05
great movies for grown-ups you know like sophisticated dramas you know like after
30:11
years of just you know having superheroes shoved down our throats I just feel like this has just been an incredible year for the movies um and I
30:19
would just want to shout out one in particular that actually didn't really get much attention from the from the Oscars but um if you have not seen all
30:26
of us strangers which uh Stars uh Andrew Scott uh better known to most people as
30:32
uh hot priest from flea bag love him if you're in the mood to sit in a darkened
30:38
theater and just cry your eyes out at like a beautiful beautiful beautiful story highly recommend so I am just
30:45
absolutely RedHot on the movies um have you guys seen anything you love this year I seen a ton this year I'm I'm
30:52
married to a a kind of earthqu movie critic so we we see everything although
30:57
my enduring problem is they're so long that I still prefer to watch at home so
31:04
that I can pause 35 times during the course of the three and a half hours I'm expected to sit through whatever I just
31:11
I just want to note that we have a current movie critic uh among us at the moment Ross yeah know this was this was
Conclusion
31:17
this was a really good year I mean I am I have been a big movie pessimist I wrote a big piece for this for this
31:23
newspaper about sort of the end of the movies as the sort of shared defining
31:29
American art form a couple of years ago um and I think there there's no question this is the best year for movies since
31:37
you know certainly before the pandemic um so yourie was wrong my piece was
31:42
wrong was wrong when you write a piece Carlos that declares the end the end of
31:48
something if you read the piece carefully it always includes some important caveats no I I don't I don't
31:54
think I don't think we're fully back in part because of people like Michelle who insist on you know watching at home and
32:01
not embracing The Full Experience I think the the best side is not so much
32:07
just like you know the cultural salience of Barbie and Oppenheimer together and these kind of things but the Marvel and
32:15
the superhero industry falling on hard times so the best thing about 2023 in
32:21
movies was that a lot of superhero movies disappointed and here's to that plus I got to buy a pink jumpsuit to
32:26
wear just saying I've I've also returned to the movies a little bit but I've I'm
32:32
doing it by returning to sort of old movies that I never saw oh my and and um
32:37
well I I'd never seen The French Connection and I saw it recently picking your feet and pyy I loved it I love The
32:44
French Connection the car chase is one of where he's where Jean Hackman is like chasing the train is one of the most
32:49
amazing scenes I've ever seen but that also like Michelle that keeps me in the house you know it doesn't leave me out
32:55
among the humans if you lived here in New York City you could like me be a member of Film Forum where I recently saw For the First Time The Third Man
