The Presidential Fitness Test


0:00
you know we should actually go full castanza and call each other the moops right matter of opinion oh I'm
0:07
sorry the card says moops moops moops from New York Times opinion I'm
0:14
Lydia PA green I'm Michelle CLE I'm Ross stett and I'm Carlos Lozada and this is
0:20
matter of [Music]
0:28
opinion so when I saw last week's special Council report on Biden and all the
0:34
reaction that followed paired with Trump of course facing dozens and dozens of felony charges it really made me realize
0:41
how much this election is going to revolve around the question of Fitness so I really wanted to ask you guys yes
0:46
or no do you think either Trump or Biden is fit to be president who wants to go
0:52
first I mean Biden is fit to be president right now yeah Trump hasn't been fit to be president ever I'm
0:59
concerned about both of them to be honest let's just say they're not as fit as I would want them to be but if they
1:06
are unfit it is for very different reasons H Ross no neither Trump nor Biden are fit
1:14
to be president under the terms that we would understand Presidential Fitness prior to the last 8 years yeah so let's
1:24
unpack what we mean when we talk about Presidential Fitness not just with Trump and Biden but historically at the most
1:29
basic level what do we expect of the president and is there even a way to say what's typical or normal in this office
1:36
you know we talk a lot about the new normal and I feel like I've had to get used to a lot of different new normals but yeah like what do you all think was
1:43
the last normal presidency that you would you would have as a Baseline and I kind of dispute the premise I mean I think almost all the presidencies have
1:49
been normal I think even Trump could arguably have been horrible but normal
1:55
right up until he decided to try and prevent the peaceful transfer of power I think after he lost it went off the
2:01
rails in a way that is not normal by any definition even though he was on his way out the door but Obama George W Clinton
2:09
Reagan George HW these were all normal Biden's normal that's interesting doesn't mean he needs to be reelected
2:16
but it it does mean that he's normal I would dispute the premise as well but for the opposite reason I think if you
2:22
ask any president if you could summon them all back I think they would all think that their presidency presented
2:29
unique complications and circumstances that rendered it abnormal and I think if you
2:35
let's just go back like a little bit from we going to Carter um no no no no no no no we're not going to Carter we're
2:41
not going to Carter so Biden right like oldest president ever dealing with
2:47
global pandemic predecessor who declares him illegitimate right those are somewhat abnormal circumstances Trump
2:53
impeached twice one acknowledge his defeat there's plenty more but but that'll do for abnormality like Obama
3:00
first black president you know which was itself a very unique circumstance taking office under a catastrophic economic
3:06
crisis Bush comes to office in very complicated circumstances involving the Supreme Court major terrorist attack
3:13
launches two massive Wars Clinton impeached for lying about a sexual relationship with an intern like the
3:20
star report was not normal I think you have to go back to George H W bush to
3:25
find a presidency that feels vaguely normal like there was a war but it was a small one there was a recession but it
3:31
was a short one like a former VP succeeding his boss that all seems pretty normal but if you have to go back
3:38
Biden Trump Obama Bush six presidents to find kind of a a normal only served one term yeah then
3:45
our premise seems offal may be what is actually common interesting yeah I don't know Ross do
3:51
you think would you agree do you have a different perspective well I think in terms of what we're talking about here
3:56
we're talking specifically about the capacities of the chief executive so I I agree with Carlos that there's no such
4:05
thing in recent years as sort of a perfectly normal presidency and indeed I
4:11
think the world has been getting sort of progressively weirder in various ways with every president since Clinton so in
4:18
that sense yeah some kind of normaly is inherently Out Of Reach but when we're
4:24
talking about Trump and Biden I think we're talking about sort of the everyday capacities of the chief executive right
4:31
you know your sort your confidence that they are reading briefing books and
4:37
holding you know normal policy meetings and having a sort of normal policy
4:42
process and I think obviously in that sense Trump was unus unusually abnormal
4:50
and then in Biden's case it's a little bit different I think we assume that sort of there are more normal policy
4:57
processes in the presidency but but Biden again people dispute this but I think it is just sort of palpably
5:04
diminished in the public facing part of the presidential role right and it's
5:10
basically a case where you know we've had diminished presidents before but it's usually in a particular context
5:17
it's Reagan in the last years of his second term it's woodro Wilson after his
5:22
stroke it's maybe Nixon during Watergate and with Biden it's just been sort of pretty consistent but I also think to
5:28
agree with Michelle that both presidencies have proven at various points that it's quite possible to run a
5:35
fairly normal seeming white house around a President Who lacks some of the
5:41
capacities that we took for granted in Chief Executives and that s is instructive yeah I think that's right
5:47
and I think that that that gets to another thing that's bit on my mind which is you know what exactly is the modern presidency you know there is this
5:55
kind of internal functioning versus the external part of the job that I think as
6:01
as you were saying Ross like actually highlights some of the core issue here I personally have a tremendous amount of
6:06
confidence in Biden as a kind of internal operator of that office and and to be able to manipulate the sort of
6:13
levers of the presidency within the walls of the White House but that other part of the job which is this kind of projection outward is a place where I
6:19
think there is a real sense of weakness but I I'm curious like how do you guys think that the the way in which the
6:25
presidency has has shifted and changed along with the other branches of the government has has sort of changed the
6:30
nature of this question of like what Presidential Fitness looks like well with the forward-facing part of the job
6:38
that is often underestimated in terms of how important that is people are like oh
6:43
well you want a smart president you want a policy won you want to whatever no actually you know the president is for
6:49
all intense purposes America's daddy at some point it might be America's mommy God willing but so much of it in the
6:57
modern presidency with TV is a PR job I think part of the problem at least on
7:03
the Democratic side is that an entire generation was ruined by the television show West Wing they somehow think the
7:11
president is supposed to be like this you know soaring rhetoric perfect moral
7:17
let's all get stuff done in the White House is a bunch of earnest people like one guy sits down and writes a state of
7:23
the union I just I feel like there was some kind of warping that was done there
7:29
that's still going on where everybody has some kind of unrealistic vision of what the White House and the presidency
7:35
are like and I understand that was a particular point in time but I do think
7:41
it's absurd no I think that's right that's that's actually a really good point like we have this set of
7:46
expectations of what we think the President should be but you know I do think it's it's worth thinking about
7:51
like when we look back and we think about successful presidencies what are the what are the characteristics that they have but yeah but what do we
7:58
consider successful George W Bush's presidency was considered unsuccessful by Republicans Obama disappointed his
8:05
progressives but I don't think it was quite the resounding failure that Bush's
8:12
was seen to be um Clinton I mean he had the unfortunate impeachment cuz he
8:18
couldn't gave his pants zipped FDR and Reagan were the models for people who
8:24
managed to transform the idea of what their parties were all together but that can't be the model cuz that's so rare I
8:30
mean when you're talking about success what is it you know like HW didn't get reelected again but that seems a pretty
8:36
narrow version of faure I think that's I think that's an important part right I think a really successful president has
8:43
to be reasonably popular not insanely popular but reasonably popular has to
8:49
not have his party collapse under his tenure and should leave office you know
8:54
not waiting through catastrophic defeats so by that measure Reagan looks quite
9:00
successful George W bush looks quite unsuccessful and Obama is more
9:05
successful than Bush and less successful than Reagan well it's interesting and striking that the two one-term
9:11
presidents of our lifetimes until Trump came along were not one term presidents out of like horrific incompetence
9:18
necessarily I think they both there were you know honorable men who mastered the details and had a lot of preparation for
9:24
the job but both of them failed to get reelected for not entirely different
9:29
reasons the vision thing the vision thing Vis the vision thing so is your opening for Carter
9:36
incidentally you know I I don't know why you think I want to talk about Jimmy Carter the um is History's Greatest
9:41
monster there there's um I mean there's no single formula right for for what makes a a successful presidency and I
9:48
think even those models well I I agree that often presidents come in with a thought of how they're going to govern
9:55
like reality takes over and the things that they thought they were ready for are not necessarily the things that come
10:01
and hit them one Tuesday Morning in September so like yes it helps to have a great team of advisers and you know
10:07
seasoned cabinet officers but you can just look at the you know advisers and cabinet members that led us into Vietnam
10:13
or led us into Iraq right to know that there's no guarantee of that like it's great to have Congressional majorities
10:19
but you know Jimmy Carter um had that and struggled to get things done they didn't even get along you could say that
10:24
having even popular opinion on your side is good but Clinton was impeached during a second term where he was he had
10:31
consistently High approval ratings so there are no no formulas really like when I think of the presidency I um you
10:38
know like when you're a manager and you're trying to hire trying to like fill a job you can either pick someone who's like perfect for that job you know
10:45
for like the particular thing you think you want in that job or someone who will just be good in your organization and
10:51
can do a lot of different things always go with the versatility because you never know what you're going to be
10:57
needing from that person you know in the moment you think you want a president for one reason but then it turns out you
11:03
need that president to lead you in a completely different circumstance now one of the interesting things that Trump
11:08
always promised coming in was that he was going to hire the best people you know he didn't have a lot of experience
11:16
which he sold as a plus but he was going to hire all the best people to come in and do the nitty-gritty now what he
11:22
wound up doing was having massive turnover and a lot of acting and having
11:27
a complete dumpster fire of an Administration especially early on but that does speak to the whole idea that
11:35
the presidency relies on all of these functionaries and all of these
11:40
appointees to do a lot of the nitt gritt and you don't really have to be a policy
11:46
wonk or know all of the levers right I mean I in the end a lot of the Trump
11:52
presidency ended up turning on the actions of amid the turmoil the actions
11:58
of a few key hires it made a big difference when John Kelly was Chief of Staff he really seemed to stabilize the
12:05
Trump White House um it made a big difference that Steve minuchin who you
12:10
know everyone was sort of baffled right by his appointment but he ended up staying through the entire Trump
12:16
presidency and managing the ultimately fairly successful Trump portion of the
12:21
response to co so the you know the Kelly minuchin presidency was in a way much
12:29
much more successful than anyone would have expected you know based on some of the chaos around those figures yeah and
12:36
I think that that sort of brings us back to this question of Health I mean one could argue that Trump is just sort of
12:42
like temperamentally incapacitated um and you know Ross you're basically
12:47
arguing that like with the right people around him like you could actually have pretty decent outcomes but there there
12:52
have been moments in history where there have been presidents who've been really seriously incapacitated some of them are
12:58
you know long ago in the past like woodro Wilson he had a stroke his wife Edith some might argue that she was our
13:04
first female president but I think it's it's unelected unelected Wilson running
13:10
the government which is not a good thing for um the practice of democracy no but
13:15
but there also I mean you know obviously FDR didn't want people to know that he was unable to walk on at it and so on
13:20
and of course he was in very very poor health before he ran for his fourth term there were multiple problems with it including the fact that he was running
13:27
for a fourth term um but you know John F Kennedy with his Addison's disease and more recently obviously the attempted
13:33
assassination of Ronald Reagan there was a projection that Reagan was fine um and
13:38
running the presidency from his hospital bed but we later learned that he was actually quite a bit more incapacitated
13:44
than we actually knew and so I mean we do have some like recent examples of Health being like a really big Live
13:50
question although it seems like we we learn about it a little bit too late in the game well Trump's case of Co was
13:57
actually much more he was much iller and closer to death than we thought at the
14:02
time it's not just that Health impaires them from being able to do their job is that the way they respond to health
14:10
problems is often by hiding by Lying by equivocating by concealing from the
14:17
public what is actually going on and that to me is just as concerning as the fact that like you know maybe for a
14:23
certain period of time they weren't well right you've never had a sort of clear
14:29
successful Devolution of authority from an incapacitated president to someone
14:36
else in the 25th Amendment which is designed for the temporary or permanent removal of a incapacitated president you
14:45
were supposed to have this kind of mechanism for how this is supposed to happen but it has never effectively
14:50
happened in anything like that way you have the behindth scenes scramble around Reagan you know with Al ha allegedly
14:59
charge right you have you know the the late Nixon period with again supposedly
15:05
Henry Kissinger and others effectively working around a sort of hard drinking despairing president you have the pett
15:12
coat government as it was called of Edith Wilson again the shadow that hangs
15:18
over an aged president or especially I think an aged candidate for president is
15:24
in a way the sort of total unknowability of what happens if Frailty turns into
15:30
total incapacitation well that's one of the things you're seeing on the campaign Trail is people are okay they were okay
15:35
with the idea that Biden was going to come in for four years and serve as a bridge as he put it and they're fine
15:43
with how he is now for the most part but they are not confident that he can run an hard campaign and then do another
15:51
four years and some people are quite angry about this even people who voted for him and thinks he's done a great job
15:58
as president are like no not another four years of this it's too risky yeah I
16:05
mean there was a 2019 um huff post yugov survey that found that 44% of registered voters said that Biden's age uh would
16:12
make it difficult for him to serve effectively right but if you look at the time Sienna poll from 2023 it found that
16:19
71% of battleground State voters believed that he was too old to be president so there's clearly been some
16:24
shifting in that thinking over the course of his presidency and we'll get into that after the
16:37
[Music]
16:49
break and we're back before the break we talked a lot about the idea of a normal
16:54
presidency and looked at the past for examples now I want to return to the present and look a little bit more
16:59
closely at the Trump and Biden presidencies so how do you think Biden and Trump have shaped the office I think
17:06
they have completed a process that was already begun under Bush and Obama and sort of killed off the president as sort
17:14
of unifier and chief where there was in the let's say in the television age
17:19
especially the radio age too there was a sense of the president as the figure who
17:26
appeared at times of national crisis and in times of national crisis most people were expected to Rally to and support
17:33
the president who who could be in some sense a little bit above partisanship but I think the distinction with Trump
17:39
and Biden is that neither of them have really even been able to try to play that role Trump for reasons of sort of
17:47
temperament and style has always just presented himself as the Tribune of one
17:53
grieved half of America against the other Biden I think a little bit in 2020
17:59
was able to fill the role saying you know we're going to return to normaly after Trump but his diminishment his
18:04
inability to sort of just be out there right and sort of play that role it it
18:11
just seems like that that role just seems kind of dead maybe someone can bring it back but it seems dead to me right now I don't think that Biden has
18:18
done much to change the role I mean he's operated as a pretty standard president I mean he's even tried to get Congress
18:24
to move forward with bipartisan agreements and he has in some cases been pretty successful I think Trump's
18:32
inclination has clearly been to try and amass more power under the executive and
18:39
the plan that we've all been hearing about if he gets another term is to
18:44
accelerate that and remake the government such that all of the guard rails that he found frustrating last
18:51
time around will be removed now that he knows how it operates so I think it's
18:56
clear that he has a sense of what what he'd like to do if he's given another opportunity and it is all it is all in
19:03
that direction I would agree with Michelle on the Biden front I think that
19:09
even if some of the legislation that has been passed and you know some of the policies may we may think are are
19:15
transformative for the country I don't think they're transformative for the presidency this gets back to the sort of westwing ification of presidential
19:22
politics that Michelle raised but I think when we look back on presidencies we we think about these moments of
19:28
soaring rhetoric what I find interesting about Trump is that he takes those kind
19:36
of performative elements of the presidency and seems to think that that's almost all there is his
19:43
presidency felt like an extension of his campaign rallies um Sue Hennessy and Ben
19:48
Wht wrote a good book about this called unmaking the presidency and they where they explored this and they they
19:53
concluded that for Trump the presidency was really not about you know as much as
19:59
now people think it's going to be sort of managing the bureaucracy or achieving key you know legislative or policy goals
20:05
but about Showmanship about flamboyance about keeping his audience entertained
20:10
he really loved those parades so many parades what one of the things that I've noticed about Trump and when he sort of
20:17
like flubs something or misspeaks because that's a thing that a lot of people have accused Biden of doing but
20:22
what one of the things I've noticed is that sometimes his bizarre statements often seem more like Freudian slips than
20:28
poor memory like um saying that he defeated Barack Obama rather than Hillary Clinton like I I I think like in
20:35
his imagination perhaps he thinks of uh defeating Barack Obama as being more worthy of his of his greatness or
20:41
sometimes they're like strategic like uh confusing Nikki Haley with Nancy Pelosi like that does not do any favors to
20:47
Nikki Haley with the Republican electorate but there is this way in which like Trump somehow as he clearly
20:53
has just done to me convinces you to think that he's like crazy like a fox whereas with Biden it's just sort of
20:58
feels like he's always been Gaff prone but it does feel like substantively different and and yeah I'm curious what
21:04
you guys think it's also important to remember that people like us and a lot of the kind of chattering class care a
21:11
lot more about how eloquently these guys speak I mean n Gingrich was not wrong on
21:18
slum level when he praised Trump for speaking at a level that like a fifth grader could understand and I remember
21:24
this back during the campaign between Al Gore and George W bush I mean Bush was
21:30
famous for bushisms which were just kind of misspeaking or or flubbing something
21:35
and Gore was obviously kind of much wonkier and more articulate and things like that and people hated that he was
21:43
such the nerd it was like he was talking down to them and if there is one thing
21:48
that the American electorate cannot abide it is a politician talking down to them or sounding like he is talking down
21:56
to them so Trump not being able to make a coherent speech plays pretty well in a
22:04
lot of corners or at least doesn't really bother people I mean it bothers me but it doesn't bother most people
22:10
part of the issue here that you know we're going to end up litigating as this insane campaign heats up is how much has
22:18
each man changed over the last five six seven eight years you know if you go
22:25
back and listen to Donald Trump give interviews in the 1990s and then compare that to him giving interviews while
22:31
running for president in 2016 it is very clear that 2016 Trump was quite
22:37
diminished relative to 1998 Trump but that 2016 Trump then did go on to be
22:43
president for four years so people a lot of the voters who might vote for him again right sort of accept the idea that
22:52
you know 2016 Trump was capable of being president so then the question is how different is 202 24 Trump from 2016
23:00
Trump right so it's like yeah he you know he Rambles he gets names wrong he you know he he says sentences that don't
23:06
make sense but he did that in 2016 too has he really changed that much whereas the issue for Biden I think is that he
23:14
seems more diminished relative to a prior status quo than does Trump I think
23:19
it boils down to Trump seems crazy and Biden seems frail and America prefers crazy a lot of the time I I worry that
23:26
this election is shaping up into a contest between the unfit and the unwell
23:32
and those are two different things I see Trump is unfit for office for reasons
23:37
that have nothing to do with his age or the way he speaks on the stump or his rambling I it's because of his character
23:44
and his actions and his beliefs but if if Trump's unfitness is about who he is Biden's is about who he's becoming it's
23:52
it's hard to say that he's been unfit for the job so far I think he's governed reasonably well in this first term the
23:58
question for us not not for us as like podcast host the question for us as voters right is is whether projecting
24:04
Biden forward we think he will remain well enough to endure the rigors of this
24:09
incredibly demanding job so yesterday I watched just a couple of his public events from 2020 you know three three
24:16
and a half years ago and I have to say he he looked sharper and quicker significantly so back then you know and
24:23
I I was um Evan osnos wrote a good book a short good book about Biden in 2020
24:29
and when osnos asked Biden about the age issue back then he put it in a way that
24:36
was um I think appropo for today he said I asked Biden how he would respond if opponents say he was too old to be
24:42
president I think it's totally legitimate for people to raise it he said and I'll just say look at me decide
24:51
H he's basically saying like it's the eye test right like you'll know when you see it and the eye test isn't going well
24:58
for him lately well and it's also that I mean the the The crucial element here is
25:03
that Biden has a vice president who is seen as less competent than he is who is
25:10
seen as more leftwing than he is and who would not as far as we can tell be
25:17
someone that most Americans would want to be president so it's Biden is presenting himself as someone who may or
25:24
may not be too frail for the job but regardless of whether he's too fr for the job the worry I mean the literal
25:31
worry is that he's just very likely to become incapacitated if he takes a further step
25:37
down or to actually die and we would just everything here would be different
25:42
if Biden's vice president was seen as popular and moderate and a safe choice
25:50
for the Democrats I think that's just an underlying reality here on the campaign Trail Nikki Haley has been kind of
25:56
explicitly campaigning on the a vote for Biden is a vote for a president Harris
26:02
and that actually has a disturbing residence like people have a gut level
26:07
reaction to that on the campaign trail that we could parse all day long but you're not WR I have a gut I have a gut
26:13
level reaction to that it's not like she's some flaming revolutionary I find
26:18
it fascinating she's a former prosecutor she's a prosecutor I mean the progressives weren't happy about it to
26:24
some degree so it's it is fascinating just the level of uhhuh who has presented herself in her
26:31
entire presidential Incarnation as a voice who never
26:37
deviates from whatever the progressive line happens to be who has made no effort to present we do a episode
26:44
another time but I will Retreat from my critique but only to say that I think you cannot underrate how important this
26:50
element is to the particular fix that we're all in I think that that's right uh but I also think that you know we
26:57
don't yet know who Trump's uh VP is going to be and how that's going to sort of affect the race over it's going to be
27:02
me I can I can break the news today that I have been asked and accepted I'm
27:08
definitely not voting for him safe hands all right well we'll have to talk
27:15
more about ross' ascendancy to the VP slot in another episode when we come back hot and
27:23
[Music] cold
27:32
[Music]
27:40
[Music] and finally it's time for hot cold where
27:46
every week one of us shares something we're into over or somewhere in between so who's got the hot cold this week it's
27:53
me um it's me why you sound so hot on it well no no because sad I'm the problem
27:59
this is this is fansi Jumping the Shark a little bit maybe with hot cold I fear I'm I'm venturing into Andy Rooney
28:06
territory Venture Venture and and I'm willing to be dissuaded on this point but I am cold on countdown clocks H
28:15
there is an excess of stuff in my life that has countdown clocks and they're
28:21
starting to stress me out a little bit and this has become very apparent to me just in the last few weeks before a
28:28
major sporting event such as I don't know the Super Bowl you have the countdown to kickoff now if I'm the kind of person who's watching hours of Super
28:35
Bowl pregame commentary hypothetically yes hypothetically not that I would be but if I were that person chances are
28:42
I'm also the kind of person who knows when kickoff is I don't need the countdown clock there are countdown
28:47
clocks to tell me exactly how many seconds I have to wait for the online ad
28:53
to finish if there's an ad there's an ad I'll live with it I'll be fine fine I don't need to know that there's like 12
28:58
seconds left before I can enjoy the thing I want to enjoy what really got me thinking about this was the coverage of
29:04
the Iowa caucuses on CNN last month their panelists were discussing what might happen in Iowa like all day long
29:11
and they had an official on-screen clock counting down not to when the caucuses
29:16
began but to when CNN's official coverage from Iowa would begin at 4 p.m.
29:23
and then at 4 p.m. they began another countdown clock counting down the 4
29:28
hours until the caucuses actually started this seems insane and I I got
29:34
very upset just sort of staring at that new 4-Hour countdown clock the proliferation of the clocks of the
29:40
countdowns makes it feel like there's this inexorable tick tock tick tock tick tock all the time like I'm always counting something down it makes it
29:46
harder for me to just be in the moment and not always be counting to the next thing stop all the clocks cut off the
29:55
telephone prevent the dogs I don't mind I don't time doesn't bother me countdown
30:00
I think this is an objection to time itself car yeah keeps on ticking ticking ticking there must be market research
30:06
that tells everyone that these things are popular that people like these things or that it creates a sense of urgency surrounding whatever they're
30:13
trying to sell us well I feel like there's a different the the countdown clock on the YouTube ads it's keeping
30:19
you there I feel like the clocks on cable news especially but also the NFL
30:25
and so on are Hess attempts to preserve a dying medium I want you to be excited if it's counting down it must be
30:31
counting down I'm excited to watch the Super Bowl I don't need a countdown clog telling me it's like 4 hours and 57
30:38
minutes away I'll I'll tell you I wared you I I'm going to be I'm going to be counting down till the next time I get
