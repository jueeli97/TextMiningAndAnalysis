Thomas Friedman on Iran, Israel and Preventing a ‘Forever War’


0:00
hey Tom hey colleagues friends sir Tom
0:05
doctor it's nice to see you thanks so
0:07
much for doing this yes thank you Tom oh
0:09
this is great I'm really looking forward
0:10
to it yeah slow slow news week so fig
0:13
much fig pull you in you know just was
0:16
scrape around for something to
0:19
say from New York Times opinion I'm
0:22
Lydia pgreen I'm Ross dait I'm Carlos
0:24
Lozada and this is matter of opinion
0:31
[Music]
0:34
so over the past few weeks Israel and
0:36
Iran have engaged in a military standoff
0:38
Israel struck the Iranian Embassy in
0:40
Syria killing several top Iranian
0:41
military officials then last weekend
0:44
Iran sent hundreds of drones and
0:46
missiles towards Israel and finally
0:49
early this morning Israel retaliated
0:51
striking a military base in Iran
0:54
Michelle coddle is out this week so to
0:55
try to unpack what all this means we
0:57
asked our colleague Tom fredman to join
0:58
us this convers was recorded before the
1:01
latest attack so keep that in mind when
1:02
you're listening but we think it
1:04
provides some very helpful context to
1:06
what led us to this moment and what
1:07
could happen
1:09
next so here it is our conversation with
1:13
Tom welcome back to matter of opinion
1:15
Tom thank you Lydia it's great to be
1:17
back so let's get right into it how did
1:20
Iran's attack on Israel come to be well
1:23
um uh roughly a week before Iran
1:27
launched its missile attack Israel
1:30
killed several very very senior Iranian
1:33
revolutionary guard commanders who were
1:35
in a adjunct building to the Iranian
1:38
Embassy in Damascus meeting with
1:39
operatives at the same time and this
1:42
gentleman was reportedly responsible for
1:46
really running all the sort of Iranian
1:49
operations in Lebanon in Syria and so
1:54
from the Israeli point of view he was a
1:56
a very high value Target I was surprised
1:58
they did this it's not something I
2:01
thought was very wise My grandmother
2:03
used to say just one war at a time
2:05
please and this really was a provocation
2:10
even for the ongoing Shadow war between
2:13
Israel and Iran which has been ongoing
2:15
now for years this was definitely a step
2:17
up and the Iranians honored the Israeli
2:20
Step Up by taking a massive Step Up of
2:23
their own on Saturday by launching some
2:27
300 drones missiles and cruise missiles
2:30
at Israel from Iran marking the first
2:34
time that any Middle East state has
2:37
attacked Israel since Saddam Hussein did
2:40
it with scuds 33 years ago and in the
2:43
context of the Israeli Iranian again
2:45
tirat Shadow War uh neither has ever
2:48
done such a thing I didn't buy and don't
2:51
buy the notion that they were counting
2:53
on Israel's air defense system to shoot
2:56
down basically all 300 with help from
2:59
allies
3:00
that was actually quite a remarkable
3:02
military feat had one of them gotten
3:04
through and hit an Israeli school or a
3:06
government building this audio program
3:09
would be about fullscale war in the
3:12
Middle East right now so your view is
3:15
that that possibility was built in to
3:18
the Iranian attack right because both
3:20
during the attack honestly and then
3:22
immediately afterward there was this
3:24
running debate about the extent to which
3:27
Iran had deliberately telegraphed this
3:29
move move telegraphed it to Israel
3:32
telegraphed it to the other Arab states
3:34
that cooperated in shooting down the
3:37
missiles which to some people seem to
3:39
imply that Iran wanted the attack to
3:42
fail but you don't think that was the
3:44
case and you think therefore Iran was
3:46
prepared for really dramatic escalation
3:50
and response from
3:51
Israel yeah Ross you know i' say two
3:54
things one is just given the physics of
3:56
it no one could count on firing 300
3:59
missile and drones at another country
4:02
that basically none would get through
4:04
that almost all 300 would be intercepted
4:07
by a in fact multinational force and
4:10
number two when it comes to Iran I
4:13
always prefer to put an S on the end
4:16
irans so maybe the supreme leader had
4:19
one thing in mind and the Iranian
4:21
revolutionary guards had another thing
4:22
in mind it's a notoriously factionalized
4:26
system particularly between the
4:27
Revolutionary guards the Army and the go
4:29
government and uh not everyone is always
4:32
aligned Tom so how much or how little
4:35
can we discern about Iran's offensive
4:40
capabilities and Israel's defensive
4:42
capabilities from what we just
4:44
saw I was trying to imagine when the
4:48
head of the Iranian Air Force reported
4:50
back to the Supreme Leader ayalah Kini
4:53
did he breathe a sigh of relief or did
4:56
he say zero out of 300 H if that's how
5:01
bad our offense is what does that mean
5:04
for our
5:05
defense remember Iran's Air Force does
5:08
not have f-35s it does not have f-15s so
5:11
they have none of the Advanced
5:13
Technologies that Israel and its allies
5:16
have and so I I think the Iranians are
5:19
much more worried right now than not
5:22
it's been a risk averse leadership that
5:24
this is not people who have gone out of
5:27
their way to bet the farm
5:30
and that's why I was really surprised
5:31
that in some ways they did cuz if just
5:33
one out of 300 gets through and causes a
5:37
mass casualty event in Israel I think
5:40
Israel they would have taken the plans
5:42
out for Iran's nuclear program and we'd
5:44
be in day five of that war right now so
5:47
I don't think the world fully
5:48
appreciates how close we came that
5:50
that's just my gut feeling yeah what
5:53
what's going on in Israel what are the
5:54
calculations that are happening right
5:56
now in terms of how to respond um there
5:59
was in the immediate moment this idea
6:01
that they must hit back and hit back
6:02
hard now some time has passed life seems
6:05
to be returning roughly to normal in
6:07
Israel where do things stand I think
6:10
we're all trying to Divine that you know
6:12
Lydia I I say so several factors are
6:15
sort of converging here one is Israel is
6:18
having the best week of this war since
6:21
October 7th in terms of global public
6:23
opinion and people now see at the
6:26
interstate level what they're up against
6:28
you know and it's not inconsist able and
6:29
that's why you've had visits by the
6:31
German foreign minister the British
6:33
people really expressing solidarity but
6:36
within the Israeli government one of the
6:39
things that's troubled me since the War
6:41
Began is that there's basically no
6:43
opposition in
6:44
Israel since the beginning of the war
6:46
there's been no opposition it's not like
6:49
gance and Eisen cot you know who have
6:50
joined the government from the leading
6:53
opposition party I mean they're I don't
6:55
know 10 degrees different from Netanyahu
6:57
but it's not like there's a Liberal
7:00
Party arguing something completely
7:02
different at all it's much more Nuance
7:04
in other words Israeli politics still
7:06
revolves around BB Netanyahu and he's in
7:08
everybody's head and as a result of that
7:12
there is no loud significant opposition
7:18
articulating an alternative strategy
7:21
like maybe not retaliating for either
7:25
Gaza or now Iran there's degrees of
7:28
caution and and separ operation and I
7:30
believe one reason for that is that you
7:33
know the Army in Israel has often played
7:35
that role more than the politicians what
7:38
happened is that because the Gaza war is
7:41
a complete and catastrophic military
7:43
failure all the military Chiefs know
7:46
their careers are over and because of
7:48
that you alluded to this Lydia we are
7:51
six months into a war with no defined
7:54
endgame and the military normally would
7:57
be playing that role but I think because
8:00
everyone here is traumatized and a
8:02
little bit compromised in their own way
8:04
they're not playing that role so I think
8:07
we want to talk about endgame scenarios
8:09
but just to push on the Netanyahu thread
8:11
for a minute Netanyahu is politically
8:14
unpopular in Israel right now in the
8:17
sense that opinion polls that we can see
8:19
suggest that he would not be returned as
8:22
prime minister if elections were held
8:24
suddenly and we've had various people
8:26
yourself included our colleague Brett
8:28
Stevens arguing that for the sake of
8:31
Israel's war effort Netanyahu should go
8:35
if Netanyahu went in whatever way shape
8:38
or form what would actually follow
8:41
beyond the change in leadership style
8:44
who would be in charge and would there
8:45
be any shift in strategy or tactics Ross
8:49
there certainly would be a change in
8:50
tone when netan came in with the
8:53
farthest farri government Israel's ever
8:56
had including real Jewish proud Bo Bo I
8:59
mean Jewish supremacists their approach
9:02
was you know we're living in a one-state
9:04
reality let's behave without
9:06
self-restraint in fact let's try to take
9:08
the Supreme Court down so we can truly
9:11
behave without self-restraint so I think
9:13
the first answer to your question Ross
9:16
would be it's a government that would
9:17
not be looking in any way to provoke
9:19
things that's where I would start but I
9:23
absent what is the resolution on the
9:25
ground in Gaza how much of Hamas
9:27
survives now this Iran factor it's very
9:30
hard to predict actually how different
9:32
they would be and all I can say is about
9:35
Netanyahu is that he's compromised he
9:38
knows he has to stay in power in order
9:41
to be able to trade his office for a
9:43
plea bargain if he is
9:45
convicted therefore there isn't a
9:47
decision he makes in this war that isn't
9:50
factored in with his own political needs
9:53
which a lot of people would argue be
9:55
keep the war going and in fact um look
9:58
he didn't invite this Iran attack I
10:00
don't believe but it sure works for him
10:02
politically I bet if they took a poll
10:03
today you'd see his numbers have gone
10:05
way up Tom I want to I want to widen
10:08
that question just a tiny bit in your
10:10
latest column you wrote that there's no
10:12
hope for a resolution to the Israeli
10:15
Palestinian conflict or the conflict
10:17
between Israel and Iran without
10:20
leadership change not just in Israel
10:22
with Netanyahu but also in tan and also
10:26
in rala with the Palestinian Authority
10:28
and you know it's it's very persuasive
10:30
you kind of walked through each case but
10:32
what I wanted to ask you is you know how
10:33
much of this problem is about the
10:37
particular leadership that's in place
10:39
versus how much is about the competing
10:43
interests and forces at play that have
10:46
shown themselves to be somewhat
10:48
resistant at times to leadership
10:50
changes so Carlos I'll start at 30,000
10:53
ft of that's where you live Tom that's
10:55
great exactly that's where I have to
10:56
live cuz if you're down on the ground
10:58
man there aren't enough drugs to keep
11:00
you going so it's um uh so anyone who
11:04
knows my politics is that it's a tension
11:06
between Walter Mondale and Thomas Hobs a
11:09
lot of people keep saying two-state
11:11
Solutions of fantasy you know and I say
11:14
oh thank you for telling me I had no
11:18
idea that this was hard thank you for
11:20
telling me I get it there's about a 95%
11:23
chance that this won't work but I've
11:26
decided to dedicate my life 100% to the
11:29
5% chance that it will because the
11:32
alternative is a Forever War and if you
11:35
care about Israel care about
11:36
Palestinians that's the end of both
11:38
communities because they'll just destroy
11:40
each other basically and so the hope I
11:43
base that on Carlos is this B Netanyahu
11:47
has been in power for 16 years he has
11:49
spent 16 years doing everything he could
11:52
to denigrate the Palestinian Authority
11:55
in those 16 years with kind of a
11:57
freehand mmud Abbas the leader of the PA
11:59
has done everything to shift money to
12:01
relatives and really take advantage of
12:03
the fact that they couldn't have an
12:04
election I would just like to do a lab
12:07
test what if you had an Israeli leader
12:10
and a Palestinian leader who actually
12:12
wanted to try to make this work would it
12:15
work automatically I I have no idea and
12:17
we have the whole question of
12:18
settlements and physical problems on the
12:21
ground but I would at least like to run
12:24
that test of having someone in power in
12:26
rala and someone in power in Jerusalem
12:29
we actually want to make it work and see
12:30
how far we can get and because it's
12:32
going to have to happen
12:33
[Music]
12:35
incrementally after the break we'll talk
12:38
about what this means for The Wider
12:39
region
12:40
[Music]
12:58
[Music]
13:03
I think one of the questions here right
13:05
is people say no one wants a wider War
13:09
yeah but there are people who want a
13:12
wider War right definitely who are they
13:15
right now and what are they
13:17
thinking so Russ one is Yahya sinir the
13:20
Hamas leader who is hiding somewhere in
13:22
Gaza he need he needs a wider War he
13:26
needs a wider War because he's out to
13:28
destroy Israel think people need to
13:30
remember about senoir is senoir actually
13:32
doesn't know the Arabs very well which
13:34
is why I think he was surprised by some
13:35
of them not joining in but he knows
13:38
Israelis really well in fact he learned
13:41
his Israeli studies in prison he learned
13:44
all his Hebrew in prison and he spent
13:46
years observing Israel and all its
13:50
weaknesses and he put them all into play
13:53
in this war and he wants Israel wiped
13:56
out so he's certainly one of them I
13:59
always go back when I think about Iran
14:01
Russ to remember what ayalah Ki said
14:04
when he came to Teran from Paris in 1979
14:08
and took over basically Iran from the
14:09
Sha he said we didn't make this
14:12
revolution to lower the price of
14:14
watermelons this is a truly ideological
14:18
movement with an agenda that it is ready
14:20
to prioritize over advancing the
14:22
wellbeing of Iranians and we've seen
14:25
that now since
14:26
1979 and so you you have to take these
14:29
people very seriously they want to
14:32
destroy Israel out of conviction and
14:36
ambition whether they think they can
14:38
actually do it is a whole another
14:39
question but they're not playing around
14:42
so the Iranians what are the
14:43
Palestinians to them are they just an
14:45
instrument trying to humiliate Israel
14:48
because there's not a natural Alliance
14:50
as you said um so so how is Iran
14:53
position Visa the Palestinians here so
14:56
Iran is not popular among sort of to the
14:59
West Bank remember big part of the
15:00
Palestinian Community are Christians not
15:02
a majority but they have a significant
15:03
Christian minority in the PA Iran is not
15:05
popular Iran is extremely Adept at
15:08
cultivating underground networks and so
15:11
Palestinians are to them the same as
15:13
houis are to them the same as B is to
15:15
them the same as Shia militias in Iraq
15:18
are to them they're instruments and they
15:21
are how Iran projects power and by
15:24
basically enabling these militias with
15:27
resources and money to either take over
15:30
these countries or eat away at the
15:31
systems there so you can't get a
15:34
majority against them Lebanon has been
15:36
an elect a president now for a couple
15:38
years because Iran can't necessarily
15:41
within the Lebanese system get the man
15:43
it wants but it can make sure that no
15:45
one else can get the person they want
15:48
that would be hostile to Iran and Hamas
15:51
one has to remember Hamas launched this
15:53
war because there was a big political
15:55
struggle going on inside Hamas between
15:58
more moderate forces led by hania and
16:00
senoir and because Hamas was in a Giant
16:04
rivalry with fata in the West Bank and
16:06
fat seemed to be lining up with Israel
16:08
and Saudi Arabia to do a giant
16:10
normalization deal so take a step back
16:12
from all the sort of Hamas ideology
16:14
Charter this was also very much local
16:17
politics at work so I just want to push
16:20
you to make a specific prediction sorry
16:23
about what the what the Israelis are
16:25
going to do because in the narrative
16:27
your Narrative of the Iran Iranian
16:29
desire for a wider War it seems like
16:31
what constrains Iranian leadership is
16:34
fear that they would happily go to war
16:37
with Israel tomorrow if they thought
16:39
they could win it so if you are in the
16:41
Israeli cabinet right now are you
16:43
thinking we must strike back to restore
16:47
deterrence and maintain fear or are you
16:50
thinking Iran failed
16:53
sufficiently that they will be deterred
16:55
from trying this again what are you
16:58
thinking and what are they going to do
17:00
what are they going to do I don't know
17:01
Russ I'll just say what I been thinking
17:03
from day one of the war that Israel
17:05
needs to ask itself what its worst
17:07
enemies want it to do and do the
17:09
opposite and it's rooted in a larger
17:11
framework that I have which is that I
17:14
can write the history of this conflict
17:15
for you long I wrote a whole book b to
17:18
Jerusalem about it or I can write
17:21
history really short and it fits on a
17:23
business card War timeout War timeout
17:26
War timeout War timeout War timeout out
17:29
War timeout going back to 1929 if not
17:31
earlier and the difference between the
17:33
two sides is what each did in the
17:34
timeout Israel built one of the
17:36
strongest economies in the world Hamas
17:39
dug tunnels and nurs a grievance and my
17:42
view is that the Israeli number one
17:45
objective should always be to get to the
17:47
timeout whenever they can as much as
17:49
they can now maybe in this situation
17:52
it's unavoidable they just can't that's
17:54
what they would argue I'm not sure
17:56
that's the case but Israel wins in the
17:58
the timeouts and it loses in times of
18:01
War especially where we are now
18:04
historically politically and
18:06
technologically in a social wired
18:09
Network world where when you lose on Tik
18:12
Tock now you don't just lose Muslim
18:15
Americans in Michigan you lose a whole
18:18
generation and I think Israel is in real
18:20
danger of losing a whole generation
18:23
right
18:25
now after the break we'll talk about
18:27
what this means for the future of the US
18:29
in the Middle
18:49
East I wonder if we could maybe spend
18:51
some of our remaining time talking about
18:53
what the next timeout might look like if
18:56
we're able to get there back in January
18:58
which feel so long ago you wrote a
19:00
column saying that October 7 had
19:02
propelled a fundamental rethinking of
19:05
the Middle East inside the Biden
19:06
Administration and you outlined what you
19:07
thought was an emerging Biden Doctrine
19:11
for the region given how the conflict
19:13
has evolved since then how is the
19:16
administration thinking about the region
19:19
broadly speaking now is there a coherent
19:21
doctrine that you see still at work or
19:23
in development here Carlos I just say
19:26
before I answer it this is I've been
19:28
doing this this my entire adult life
19:29
I've been following in the Middle East
19:31
since I was 15 I'm now 70 this is the
19:34
absolutely worst moment I ever remember
19:37
and the most worrisome um for the whole
19:40
region spinning out of control I would
19:42
say the Administration has a broad
19:45
Doctrine which is Israel should find a
19:48
way to finish the operation of
19:51
dismantling Hamas in a way that spares
19:54
as many innocent Gaz and civilians as
19:56
possible it should then work with the PA
20:00
with the support of countries like the
20:02
UAE Saudi Arabia Egypt Jordan when they
20:06
are of sufficient capacity and strength
20:08
the PA plus Allied countries Jordan
20:11
Egypt UAE Saudi Arabia should then be
20:14
the ones to govern Gaza maybe even with
20:16
some American logistical help and then
20:20
Israel should provide some political
20:23
Horizon for the Palestinians so Israel
20:26
can then normalize with Saudi Arabia and
20:28
we then find ourselves with a broad
20:32
inclusion Network in the region
20:34
stretching from Egypt through Gaza the
20:37
Arabian Gulf countries and we're in a
20:39
whole new Middle East that's the hope
20:42
it's still not impossible I would say
20:44
but it takes me back Carlos to again
20:47
what I said on early on after the war
20:49
which is what was going on in the world
20:50
on October 6th you know on October 6
20:54
Ukraine was trying to join the west and
20:56
Israel was trying to join the Arab East
20:58
Ukraine was was trying to get into the
20:59
European Union and Israel was trying to
21:01
normalize with Saudi Arabia this was a
21:04
pivotal 1989 moment and Russia
21:07
understood the first and stopped it and
21:10
Hamas and Iran understood the second and
21:12
stopped it because if these two events
21:15
had happened if the first had happened
21:17
it would be the biggest change in Europe
21:19
since East Germany joined West Germany
21:21
we would be 9/10 to a world a Europe
21:23
whole and free in the Middle East it
21:25
would be the biggest expansion of the
21:27
inclusion Network since camp David and
21:29
it would open up the whole Muslim world
21:31
to Israel so we were at a pivotal we
21:34
still are at a
21:35
pivotal moment that will actually Define
21:38
the post post Cold War World in both
21:40
Europe and the Middle East if we take
21:41
these two theaters together it may not
21:44
feel like it but this is 1989 this is a
21:47
pivotal moment that is going to define
21:50
the post post Cold War World and that's
21:53
why I'm I feel strongly about both aid
21:55
for Ukraine and making sure that the
21:57
Palestinian Authority Israel Saudi
22:00
Arabia Egypt Jordan come out of this the
22:02
right way but one big stumbling block to
22:05
that and you didn't mention and you
22:06
talked about who wanted a widening War
22:08
but it's clear that Netanyahu wants this
22:10
war to continue and needs this war to
22:12
continue yeah does the potential
22:14
widening of the war weaken or strengthen
22:17
him and how do we contend with that as a
22:19
factor overall I mean Biden has been
22:21
trying very hard to exercise influence
22:23
but it's hard to exercise influence on
22:25
someone who feels cornered and running
22:27
for their life yeah you know Lydia's
22:29
been a problem from day one and it's why
22:33
I've focused on him so much he's not on
22:36
the level uh as a leader right now in
22:39
terms of his decision- making you know
22:41
that said he's also not alone he has to
22:44
balance his far-right Coalition partners
22:47
with Benny gance with the Army and with
22:49
the public so it's not like he can just
22:52
keep people at War forever he's under
22:54
huge pressure from hostage families but
22:56
he can drag things out at the margins
22:58
you know more and less you know he can
22:59
extend this thing if he wants but I
23:01
don't think it's indefinite Joe Biden
23:04
seems like an eternity ago but a couple
23:06
weeks ago after the tragic killing of
23:08
Jose andreas' team Biden basically
23:11
called him up and said uh here's what
23:13
you're going to do and if you don't do
23:15
it you're basically on your own and that
23:17
got his attention because Israeli Prime
23:19
Ministers depend on an American
23:22
president to deal with their internal
23:24
politics they need to be able to go back
23:26
to the cabinet and say I would never do
23:28
that but this s o Biden he broke my arm
23:32
he broke he broke my arm you know I
23:35
would never do this but the Americans
23:37
made me do it and so we need to always
23:39
be aware of that role that we play some
23:41
would say Biden didn't play it hard
23:43
enough early enough I think it's a
23:44
tricky question because you also don't
23:45
want to give Hamas a pass and think that
23:48
okay now the Americans have got BB's
23:50
hands tied behind his back because then
23:52
Hamas will take advantage of it so
23:54
navigating this war is just Hell on
23:56
Wheels but so just to clarify from the
23:58
point of view of the Israelis who do not
24:02
have netanyahu's specific political
24:04
incentives but share his perspective
24:07
which as you're arguing is most of the
24:09
key players yes what's the difference
24:12
between the endgame you just sketched or
24:15
the timeout you just sketched which
24:17
presumably is the one the Biden
24:19
Administration is seeking yes and what
24:21
they think like if netanyahu's cabinet
24:25
gets what they want in the war in the
24:27
next 6 months
24:29
what does their view of the timeout look
24:31
like Ross I'm going to tell you the
24:33
craziest thing one of the craziest
24:36
things I've ever seen covering
24:38
international
24:39
relations I don't know the answer
24:42
because no one in Israel has said even
24:44
the opposition has not said what is the
24:46
endgame in
24:48
Gaza and we are 6 months into this war
24:50
and and I'm not being queed or anything
24:53
I I have no idea just doesn't make sense
24:57
to me and and it work I think it's just
24:59
incredibly Reckless one can only Divine
25:01
by their actions Ro that their ideas is
25:03
to finish off Hamas and Rafa if they can
25:08
and I think that's a dubious proposition
25:11
I wrote early on the four most dangerous
25:12
words in the Middle East are once and
25:14
for all nothing ever ends once and for
25:17
all there and then the plan Ross seems
25:20
to be to pull largely out of Gaza except
25:23
for a perimeter and the road bisecting
25:26
it and use those two sort of positions
25:29
to go in and out at will but I was there
25:33
a few weeks ago with General Cilla our
25:35
sencom commander we were actually at the
25:37
ARs Crossing and being briefed by an
25:39
Israeli Colonel and he said we're
25:42
basically all out of Northern Gaza I
25:46
said what what he said we we've left
25:49
Northern Gaza I said well who's
25:51
governing you know Northern Gaza a lot
25:54
of the population have been depopulated
25:55
but and he didn't have an answer and I
25:58
immediately and I wrote a column about
26:00
this had a flashback to being in Iraq 3
26:02
weeks after the war in umasa and saying
26:04
where are the Americans where are the
26:06
British and no one was there because
26:08
they had left a completely ungoverned
26:10
space so either you're going to have uh
26:12
Somalia where Israel goes in and out or
26:15
Hamas coming back or you're going to get
26:18
a new Israeli government that invites
26:19
the PA in but right now no one is
26:22
talking that way and so we're six months
26:25
into this war and I can't answer your
26:28
most basic question because not just
26:31
because netan hasn't answered it because
26:33
gance and Eisen Cott the opposition have
26:36
an answered it and the opposition
26:38
outside the government haven't offered a
26:41
kind of third way and that gets to the
26:45
deformities of the Israeli political
26:46
system right now that there is no
26:50
opposition Tom thank you so much for
26:52
coming to spend some time with us today
26:53
thank you so much Tom I feel like it's
26:55
wonderful to be with uh my great
26:57

27:06
I've ever
27:07
covered H that's saying something great
