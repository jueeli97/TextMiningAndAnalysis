Our Super Bowls, Ourselves


0:00
if you're asking for my goals you need a Kansas City Chiefs Victory and then you need Travis Kelce to marry Taylor Swift
0:06
in a you know in a in a royal wedding to win first they have to marry on the 50 yard line and I mean that's it'll just
0:14
all go your way need you to get out of the house more at some point it does at some point it has to start all going my
0:22
way from New York Times opinion I'm Carlos lzada I'm Michelle coddle I'm
0:27
Ross stett I'm Lydia pgreen and and this is matter of opinion where thoughts are
0:35
[Music]
0:45
allowed so our thoughts today will surround the Super Bowl Super Bowl Sunday is upon us go team and uh we at
0:54
matter of opinion are going to talk football right nothing but football I was promised not not really no no so
1:02
naive no actually we're going to try to understand the Super Bowl as a cultural event as a as a collective cultural
1:09
event but I wanted to ask you guys it's sort of the season for lots of these kinds of events we just had the Grammys
1:16
uh we have the Oscars coming up next month we have the Olympics in the summer I've been thinking about what is the
1:21
impact and the purpose of these kinds of events what social and cultural function do they serve are they are they unifying
1:28
or not especially in America that as everyone tells us is is very divided so
1:34
I hope that's what we can kind of figure out and maybe one way to do that is instead of looking forward is actually
1:40
look back we've all experienced these kinds of events before is there one kind
1:45
of very memorable moment in your life where you were part of some kind of mass cultural event you feel kind of marked
1:52
you all right Michelle shoot 1981 the wedding of Prince Charles and
1:58
the it was not just me me 750 million people across 74 countries
2:05
watch this bad boy how old were you 11 so I had to get you know they're five
2:10
hours ahead of where I lived I had to drag my butt up way too early to watch all the pregaming the glass Carriage it
2:17
was kind of Glorious yeah it's funny you know I um my moment is actually more recent um and it is the finale of the
2:24
first season of Survivor a show that careful listeners of this show will know that completely completely obsessed with
2:32
so much about what our media landscape became and you know of course the president andc itself with Donald Trump
2:38
and so on really kind of call back to that creation moment with Survivor and
2:44
Survivor becoming this thing it was a time when we all watched you know shows
2:49
the day that they came out on television there was no YouTube the recapping industry didn't really exist you know so
2:56
it really was a kind of watch it live thing and um I think it was the last time that I remember having a sense of
3:02
like I cannot miss this like I will be a social outcast if I don't watch this and
3:08
I'm not able to talk about it tomorrow morning and that was in 2000 I think um
3:14
was that that long ago yeah oh my God I mean I I was trying to think of a good one with the Olympics but really when I
3:21
when I'm thinking about sort of collective events I was just a huge baseball fan and I was thinking about
3:28
the playf off and World Series after September 11th right and you know in its
3:34
own dark horrifying way 9/11 was itself a kind of collective Collective cultural
3:40
event among many other things but then there was this way in which that postseason because the Yankees were in
3:46
it and um I was a Red Sox fan so I hated the Yankees but it was the only time sort of all of America was kind of
3:53
rooting for the Yankees to be clear I was not but most of America youen falling I wasn't falling for that
4:02
I stayed true but it was like it was sort of this rolling Collective Sports
4:07
Experience culminating as all great Collective Sports experiences should in the Yankees ultimately losing ouch Ross
4:14
I thought you were going to say um George W bush throwing out that first pitch that was a wonderful moment that
4:20
was in there too that was his whole reelection campaign I mean really 911
4:25
was the entire re-election campaign but it's interesting to see that your experiences like all these experience are things
4:31
that are mediated for you through Television right like I think definitely um 9/11 I mean we were all glued to the
4:37
TV watching it happening that was you know experiencing trauma together oh
4:43
100% And I think the fracturing of that experience is a big part of the story of what is uh what has happened to us um we
4:51
are all uh you know if not bowling alone we're we're we're all watching you know
4:56
we're all watching different channels and the sense that we're coming together around big events
5:03
uh big cultural events that affect us As Americans it does feel much more
5:09
fragmented and of course that biggest event uh coming this weekend is is the Super Bowl I mean it brings in more than
5:15
a hundred million viewers think about that the only TV show finale we talk about television a lot you know to do
5:21
that ever was was Mash cheers didn't Seinfeld didn't and those were like series finales right the Super Bowl is
5:27
just a season finale I mean it's been going on for 58 Seasons right like it's just it's just one more um so you know
5:34
why why do you think this event this game has so much resonance and staying
5:39
power so I think there's a couple of things one it's become a secular ritual and people need ritual and especially as
5:46
we've become a a less religious Society with less connective ties and less
5:51
common you know media ecosystem there different elements that have grown up to
5:57
surround and Elevate this like Central piece I think people love that you know you have the commercials you have the
6:04
halftime show you have the parties with like the really bad wings and nachos which are my favorite part of this whole
6:10
thing I'm sorry fact check there's no such thing as a bad chicken wing oh God I got to disagree on that one so I just
6:18
you know True Confessions I've never watched the Super Bowl I actually really really really have some deep moral
6:24
qualms about football no Beyonce halftime show hold on hold on I'm coming to it I'm coming to it like I think that
6:30
like it's you know sort of a modern-day Gladiator sport where we you know tolerate the breaking of of of men's
6:36
bodies in ways that are you know incredibly brutal and tragic and I just like I don't know I can't I can't sign off on that so what I do instead is uh
6:44
look at YouTube to see the halftime shows because they're just they're like really wonderful and I think the most successful halftime shows um do have
6:51
this quality of just like sort of bringing people together and so I was looking back at some of my favorites and I think one of the greatest of all time
6:58
was when Prince played in the rain and of course he sang purple rain in that
7:04
moment there's a great mini documentary about that Super Bowl and that that halftime show where the producers of the
7:11
show or whatever like reached out to him and they're like you know we're really sorry but the forast is for pretty
7:17
serious rain and Prince just said can you make it rain harder right like like cu cu he
7:24
obviously knew what a moment it was going to be right and that's why you know 17 years later are still talking
7:30
about that halftime show yeah well that and he was one of the coolest ever so I mean I think part of it part of the
7:35
appeal of of the Super Bowl is just you know it's this kind of climax event of American culture right its Athletics and
7:42
its violence and its commercialism and its Regional rivalries and I mean part
7:47
of the appeal is precisely the fact that it's a gladiator sport like it's it's bread and circus you know I mean you can
7:52
have very like specific reasons why you're into it like I follow college football especially Notre Dame and so I
7:59
look to see like which Notre Dame players are advancing in the playoffs and so like the Kansas City linebacker
8:05
Drew tranquil from Notre Dame is you know starting in the Super Bowl and Aaron Banks the left guard for the ners so like I'm rooting for the two of them
8:11
more than for more than for the teams even though I I I grew up a ners fan um so I think it sort of captures a lot of
8:18
you know what we like and and maybe dislike about America all in all in one night I mean it is lurgical like it you
8:27
know it just is sort of qu I mean it's it is the Super Bowl is a liturgy I mean
8:32
and I think people who are actually religious who also like the liturgies of sort of American Pomp and power need to
8:40
recognize that you know there there is something sort of slightly debasing about going all in for a sort of pure
8:48
secular Liturgy of American excess and and so on the only thing worse than
8:53
having a somewhat debased secular patriotic liturgy is not having any
9:01
then you just kind of drift aimlessly eternally in your separate directions
9:06
well from one YouTube clip to the other so assuming that you do watch this game on Sunday Lydia um looking at you and
9:12
the rest what like why are you watching what are you looking for specifically in this experience on Sunday well I'm I'm
9:19
very interested in how we come to like hold the identities that we have and my
9:27
feeling is that a lot of the ways that which we hold the identities we have is just sort of constructed you know it's stuff that you know we get from various
9:33
places and you know we we put it together and and you know usually it's good enough to make something that feels satisfying and that's and that's great
9:40
um and being the fan of a sports team and like feeling like that's like really like a huge part of your identity and
9:47
who you are is like a great example of that and so I I sort of stand on the side and just be like wow it's kind of
9:53
amazing that people have this level of Devotion to players of this extremely
9:58
hard to follow slow moving lots of stops game and like how nice for them cuz you
10:04
know it's not easy to find a sense of belonging in this fractured and polarized world that we live in um so if
10:11
this works that's totally great I'm I'm into it like better this than say q and on those are our choices so lyia you
10:18
think the Super Bowl transcends politics rather than is becoming just one more
10:23
politicized event I think historically it has um you know it's funny I was also
10:28
thinking of about like what exactly is it about sports that illuminates something about the American character
10:34
right and I think like the NFL is racially mixed you know it is an integrated institution uh where people
10:40
cheer for stars from from all Races um you know there's the opportunity of being discovered for your Raw Talent so
10:48
I think it has these sort of Mythic qualities um that that that feed into
10:53
the possibility of it being a place where this convening can happen but I think those very same qualities also
10:59
create the conditions under which people want to bring to the attention of this
11:05
this kind of great public forum the issues that matter and I think that's why we saw the taking a knee and you
11:10
know people's anger at that um so I actually think all these controversies about quote unquote politics and at the
11:15
Super Bowl or at NFL games in general have actually been great for the sport because it it just
11:21
underscores how important uh this institution is in our culture I think
11:27
obviously football has you know interacted with the culture wars and you
11:33
know the the entire Colin kernick taking a knee debate was sort of itself clearly
11:40
connected to larger debates about race and policing wokeness you name it in
11:47
American life so it's not that it's not that sort of politics hasn't intruded
11:52
but in many ways I mean you can see this just in the ratings it it really is much
11:58
more than the Oscars which is seen as I think fundamentally left-wing just
12:04
because Hollywood is quite leftwing in any political statements are going to be leftwing I think yeah football is in a
12:11
not apolitical but sort of supra political category all its own even now
12:17
I think maybe we gave too much attention and I was guilty of this too to the kind of right-wing anti- Taylor Swift Travis
12:24
Kelce stuff like it's not clear to me that that was much more than a bunch of right-wing influencers asking for
12:30
attention which then we oblig they got they got they got right but like I mean
12:36
is you know that I I think the the potency of the Super Bowl is such that it is uncan by any faction right-wing or
12:44
leftwing huh I think what keeps football going is that it is there's nothing else
12:50
that sort of a loadbearing point in our national culture so as sort of common
12:58
culture received the things that remain take on more and more significance and in their own way
13:04
become harder to get rid of I think the NFL is in a way its cultural position is
13:09
much stronger today precisely because other forms of common athletic
13:15
experience have diminished that is a very good place for us to um take a break let's call it
13:23
halftime and when we come back we will talk about whether we need more Mass
13:29
Super Bowl style events and where we might find [Music]
13:57
them and we are back so given all the sort of
14:04
cultural and political divisions that we've hinted at is the Super Bowl really
14:10
the last example of a truly shared mass culture you know Ross suggested it's in
14:15
this like unassailable position or are there other cultural institutions that have the power to sort of bring us
14:20
together or at least draw our attention in a similar way I don't see any I mean isn't that what makes everybody nervous
14:26
kind of shared ual and institutions are fading and have lost their pull you know
14:32
whether you're talking about church or the Lions Club or even the Nightly News which you know used to have this
14:38
unifying effect on what Americans viewed as kind of cultural events and that's
14:43
fragmented into a million different pieces so I think what we're looking
14:49
more toward is kind of mini Mass cultural events and by that I mean things like a show that is popular with
14:56
a certain segment of America and so you're not approaching the
15:02
115 million necessarily but you kind of look for your moments and I think people
15:09
definitely want that and crave that I mean just look how crazy the barbon Heimer movie phenomenon was last summer
15:16
and people loved what was essentially a manufactured marketing Ploy because
15:22
people were doing it together and they felt like a part of the thing and social media was posting about it and I got to
15:28
buy my pink jumpsuit I'm just saying I need to see this pink jumpsuit Michelle I'll hook you up so guys I have a
15:34
question like what do you think is going to happen if it fades or if like what are we what are we looking at here if we
15:41
lose these things see I see I don't think it's I I don't think in the near term it's going to fade that was sort of
15:46
the the point I was trying to make with the NFL I think what has happened is that the Dynamics of Internet culture
15:56
are not that the Superstars disappear or the the shared events it's
16:02
that there's just going to be like instead of 10 shared events there's like one or two but they're bigger than ever
16:08
Taylor Swift is a good example I Taylor Swift is bigger than any singer in my
16:14
lifetime I think she's bigger than Michael Jackson maybe not bigger than the Beatles in the early 1960s but she
16:20
is huge like I when I listen to the tween girls who I am exposed to through
16:26
being a father of tween girls like remember my friends and it was like you know you would have five or 10 or 15
16:32
bands and singers you were into and today it's really it's one it's it's
16:38
just Taylor Swift Tay T and I think you know even in politics I think you can
16:43
see the you know the Donald Trump phenomenon as in a weird way reflecting reflecting their sense there can be only
16:50
one one one fan club um and in cinema like Tom Cruz is a
16:57
bigger movie star today than arguably at any point in his career certainly at any
17:02
point since the 1980s there aren't any other movie stars but there is there is
17:07
Tom Cruz um so I I think that is the weird dynamic that there is a kind of
17:13
Superstar effect that creates a few really really big Winners the NFL is the
17:18
really really big winner of sports and what's vanished is this kind of the sort
17:24
of middle siiz shared events middle siiz artists middle-size movie stars all of
17:30
that is what is diminished it's all sort of micro cultures and YouTube clips on the one hand and then a few really big
17:37
things that are right now to me feel too big to fail I think Taylor Swift is too big to fail and maybe I'm wrong maybe
17:45
the Super Bowl is one of those sort of win or take all too big to fail events
17:50
but that doesn't make it necessarily a good convenor of mass consciousness in a
17:58
way like Lydia mentioned um bowling alone that's the famous Robert putam essay from the 1990s later became a book
18:05
in which she argued that Americans were joining things less than they used to not participating in in community and
18:11
his big example was the decline of bowling leagues people were still bowling but not together they were bowling alone and his concern is that
18:18
that was a reflection of how we're no longer forming the ties that build community and that build networks um
18:24
last night in preparation for this conversation I went back and read the original bowling alone essay from the
18:30
Journal of democracy 1995 and one of the things that he focused on was what he called the the technological
18:36
transformation of leisure he was focused on TV at the time TV he said is individualizing Leisure Time inhibiting
18:42
the formation of of communities he said television has made our communities or what we experience as our communities
18:48
wider but shallower right and I wonder if the Super Bowl is that it is it is a
18:54
a wide wide wide experience but ultimately it is a a shallow one and it
18:59
is and yes we we have Super Bowl parties but we're not we're not experiencing the event together it is always mediated by
19:05
something else sure but this is telling this is the you're giving us the 1990s
19:11
critique of the shallowness of 1990s mass culture and you could say a similar
19:17
thing in books you could be like you know we've gone from book of the month club and people reading the classics to
19:22
everybody reading Stephen King and so on but then Flash Forward 20 years I love
19:27
Stephen yeah let's not talk smack I I'm not talking smack about you implied smack no I I like I like the Super Bowl
19:36
I am a I am an enjoyer of both the Super Bowl and Stephen King because I am a true American I'm just saying that in
19:43
the 1990s the Putnams of the world were like oh man you know television Pro Sports and pot boiling bestsellers are
19:50
no substitute for the oldfashioned form of community and now we're sitting here in 2024 saying man it'll really be
19:56
terrible when those pot Bo go away when the Super Bowl goes away right that that's it just reflects the change we've
20:02
lived through where everything putam said was true but it turns out that you know there are worse things than the
20:08
superficiality of common events back then yeah I I mean I think that I don't know like Nostalgia it's a hell of a
20:14
drug but over the weekend uh I went to a theater to see The Whiz uh which is the
20:21
original the whz DI Ross Michael Jackson yes yes this was a this was a
20:27
1978 ameran musical um and the reason that we went to see it was because um
20:32
for my wife this was like a huge part of her childhood this movie um and she really loved it and they had a VHS and
20:38
her parents were really into musicals um but it was a classic sort of event where it was considered a huge flop right but
20:44
I think there were like two separate experiences you know black families and
20:49
my wife's workingclass Jewish Family for whatever reason thought this was the most amazing thing and like people went
20:54
and saw it again and again and again in theaters but it was in some ways kind of like a niche of end you know like the whiz was really big with a certain like
21:02
population um later it becomes sort of a cult classic and like people love it blah blah blah so I think that the sort
21:08
of splitting and fragmentation has been with us for a long time it's just fascinating to me that like there are
21:13
these particular cultural products or cultural moments that capture like the
21:18
kind of like huge huge huge broad American attention and then there are others that sort of like just sort of
21:25
seem Niche and only get one kind of corner of it well yeah I mean you can talk a lot about the problems of
21:30
Television but you know Mass events in this country have revolved as we've noted around mass culture for a long
21:37
time I mean totally you know if you're talking about Mash with it's 105 million people watching the series finale or a
21:45
particular uh miniseries or used to when everybody would have to sit down at the same time and watch The Wizard of Oz
21:52
because it came on what was it it was like around some holiday or whatever you just didn't have that many options and there were these televised events that
22:00
people had to do because they could not sit down with their phone or other device at a moments notice and Screen
22:07
whatever they want and it's just a further fragmentation so yes every generation deals with its own media
22:14
challenges and we haven't figured out how to deal with it right now but it is costing us a lot of connective tissue
22:20
and a lot of kind of these moments but Sports is different because like it happens in time and like the result and
22:26
outcome is something that is like only going to happen once right like it's so it's in some ways it it makes sense that
22:33
this is the sort of last Refuge yeah it it totally makes sense that that retains a unique kind of power when some of my
22:40
kids were younger I remember putting on uh maybe a baseball game or a football game and they were sort of flumix that
22:46
it was happening in real time you know that that like because you I mean part of it is when you're a kid now it isn't
22:54
even you're never waiting till 8:00 p.m. for The Wizard of Oz to come come on you're you're never there's no waiting
23:00
involved in the consumption of any popular culture in an age of streaming you just assume everything is just sort
23:06
of there to be watched at any moment so the idea of a form of entertainment that
23:11
yes you can you know you can record it and watch it later but it it has an actual place in the slipstream of time
23:18
that you can only connect with at a particular moment as opposed to it being either algorithmically or culturally um
23:25
sent to you like people who didn't watch the Grammys were like oh my God I heard that there were like these three amazing
23:31
performances and then they seek them out and they either heard because it got pushed to them algorithmically on social media guil is charged I absolutely did
23:38
that or you know they heard from their friends or some combination of the both and then it becomes sort of ubiquitous
23:43
but that's very different from like just having which is the very throwback experience that I had which was like I'm
23:49
going to sit down and I'm just going to watch the Grammys and to me it did feel like I was having a real authentic
23:56
experience of something in real time that contained surprises I had no idea what to expect I had no sense of like
24:04
and it was I I let me just there no Wikipedia summary no it was wonderful I
24:09
mean it was I felt transported to a different time in my life like I just I cannot I cannot recommend this
24:15
experience highly enough Transcendent gramy yeah it was great you know I I
24:20
didn't watch it and I only saw Clips later on and when I saw Tracy Chapman and Luke Holmes do Fast Car I loved it
24:28
but I really wished I had seen it as it was happening totally but you know what one thing I'm kind of stuck on that
24:34
Michelle mentioned and all all of you have have discussed in some ways is is whether sort of community is better when
24:40
it's small than when it's big you know so like I've seen Oppenheimer twice once
24:46
was in the theater tons of people huge crowd no Community I saw it a second
24:53
time a few days ago with my wife and two friends who had us over for dinner and
24:58
to watch the movie much smaller group of people much stronger Community um those were two radically different experiences
25:06
of the Oppenheimer phenomenon and as exciting as it was to like be in the theater you know and and and and see it
25:13
when it was out um the the second experience of the movie was far more
25:19
satisfying and and meaningful those those are two different definitions of community though I mean I don't want to
25:24
get married in a stadium with like 50,000 people watching me Ross Taylor
25:29
like Taylor and Travis that's right my prediction is she never marries but can I just can I just like I actually think
25:35
there's a really important Sports distinction here because I I started out saying like I don't watch the Super Bowl and I would I don't want anyone to think
25:42
that it's because I don't like sports if you invite me to a live sporting event
25:47
whatever it is I will go with you you know I I love love love the experience
25:54
of being in a sports arena watching a game I love beer I love hot
26:02
dogs I love peanuts I love cheering I can't believe Lydia just pre-agreed to
26:08
attend my neighborhood basement fighting clubs absolutely Lydia I'm a
26:13
season ticket holder I'm I'm a season ticket holder for Notre Dame uh home games so you're you're you're you're
26:18
coming to South band with me seriously I'll come with you and and I just and I just want to say that like I think that
26:24
there is something just very different from going to the movies and I am not a fan of any sports team I mean I I I love
26:30
the New York Liberty the WNBA team because I'm a lesbian and you know that's what we do um but but you know
26:36
like if you invite me to a sports game I may know nothing about the rules I'll know nothing about the the the teams
26:42
I'll have no allegiances but I will bring all of my heart all of my
26:48
excitement and I will like enjoy the hell out of it you need to go minor league you're you strike me as more of a
26:54
minor league fan whether baseball or hockey it live I like to do it live yes
26:59
yes the Hartford yard goats is a minor league baseball team that I have been meaning to go to one of their games I
27:06
I'll meet you there for for one um so do we do we need more such
27:14
events do you do we do we want more Super Bowls we need some I don't know
27:19
how many is the right number but I definitely would like more than say
27:25
one and do they have to be huge like have to be Mass events I think you do need a couple of mass events but then
27:31
I'm I'm all for the mini Mass events I'm okay with that yeah I mean I think I think like
27:37
multi-level events is probably what what we need but I think more than anything like we need ways for us to come
27:44
together around things that unite us that don't require us to disavow the
27:49
things that that separate us right or that we might disagree on I think that you know we live in this like incredibly
27:55
polarized and divisive time and agreeing to disagree but enjoy something anyway um feels like just what
28:03
the doctor ordered that seems like a good place to end the game to call a fair catch yeah
28:10
um all right um I'll I'll I'll blow the whistle whatever you want to say um but when we come back um we are going to get
28:18
hot or [Music]
28:26
cold [Music]
28:51
and finally it is time for hot cold um who is uh sizzling or IC see today oh
28:59
that would be me this week I have been hot on revisiting my favorite offerings
29:05
from country music star Toby Keith who after dealing with stomach cancer for the past few years passed away Monday at
29:11
the age of 62 so now I know a lot of people don't like him he wound up in this big Feud with a band formerly known
29:18
as the Dixie Chicks but I've always preferred his dafier Tunes I'm a fan of
29:25
the humor that runs through country music that's what I find charming and he had a real gift for it I mean especially
29:31
kind of self-deprecating humor which we could all use a little more of so like songs like high maintenance woman Red
29:38
Solo Cup I Love This Bar or I want to talk about me these were all hilarious
29:44
and my all-time favorite as good as I once was which was an impressively
29:50
upbeat spin on how much it sucks getting older which I relate to increasingly
29:57
well these days so I am wallowing in my Keith Tunes this week and you know I
30:04
really thought it would have been a nice gesture to skip the chitchat for this episode and just run his greatest hits
30:09
for the whole time but I mean I if if you want a duet I'm happy if you to do
30:16
Beer for My Horses starting right right now we'll raise up our glasses against
30:23
evil force is singing go for it Michelle no no no I can't even approach that
30:29
range for okay and Beer for My Horses rip to a legend yeah not my favorite but
30:37
I'll allow it everybody's got their own thing no I mean I listen I I love I love
30:43
mainstream country music I'm not one of those like you know I listen to all country snobs you know love love the
30:49

30:57
