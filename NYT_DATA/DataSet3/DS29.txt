Primary Winners and National Wieners


0:00
I don't want to hear predictions about South Carolina the vicey of New Haven
0:07
the words you mention South Carolina you will be banished M yeah from New York Times
0:15
opinion I'm Ross DED I'm Michelle coddle I'm Carlos loada and I'm Lydia PA green
0:21
and this is a matter of [Music]
0:28
opinion so the Iowa caucuses are over the
0:37
2024 yay huzzah the 2024 presidential primary campaign has
0:46
begun or it might or in fact it might already be over who can say and and the
0:53
answer is we can say that's what we're going to talk about today specifically
0:58
we're going to talk about why Nikki Haley and Ronda santis weren't able to form a winning or even competitive
1:04
Coalition in Iowa and also what might possibly keep Donald Trump from being
1:10
nominated by the Republican party so on a scale of 1 to 10 how exciting shocking
1:18
amazing was this official start to the presidential cycle I mean I would say zero I I just I
1:26
Z I'm finding I'm finding it hard to have any excitement at all about this uh
1:31
this next stage of our national nightmare well exciting is a weird word
1:37
right ex exciting has like very posi that far as profess exciting has positive connotations right like I get
1:42
excited about going to the theater about watching my kids you know compete in
1:47
baseball or Irish dance right like I'm not excited about this election cycle
1:53
like it's very consequential enormously consequential right I think and we've discussed this before like I I think a
1:58
Biden Trump rematch if it comes to that would be very consequential for the country but it's exciting in the same
2:04
sense that like waiting to get some serious medical test results back is is exciting dude yeah Michelle I get really
2:12
excited about all elections because there's something deeply wrong with me
2:17
that said no you're an American this is democracy don't you get a little bit of a pent of Freedom people people putting
2:24
their little slips of paper in the county it was it was beautiful I I enjoyed thank you Carlos that's what I
2:32
was looking for on record as not a fan of the Iowa caucuses in part because I think the process is deeply flawed and
2:39
Iowa is a state that's not terribly representative of the US in general but
2:44
also because they just have a crap track record of picking even the nominees so I have issues with Iowa and this
2:51
particular Iowa caucus didn't even deliver on things like focusing on
2:56
retail politics or making it worth your while to as Ron de santis reminded us
3:01
every 15 minutes hit all 99 counties which is the only justification that you
3:08
ever get for Iowa which is like oh you have to go talk to the people Trump didn't bother still fared well in fact
3:15
we didn't have to have them at all because this is basically what we expected going in no no no no you you
3:20
always have to play the game right the the faint hint of non- excitement that I guess I'm detecting from all of you
3:27
right obviously reflects the fact that Don Trump won in a walk um biggest Iowa
3:33
margin ever probably right by beating out Bob Dole Bob Dole the former king of
3:40
Iowa dethroned by Donald Trump now I think had this been you know Trump 38
3:47
DeSantis 35 Haley 31 or something even
3:53
that's that's more than 100 Ross math is hard yes and wouldn't that have been wouldn't that have been amazing too if
4:00
Iowa had had changed math itself think about it anyway do it again with numbers
4:07
that make sense I think a closer race might have made even Carlos excited and so I guess I'm interested in looking
4:14
backward here a little bit was this just guaranteed in all the idea of a competitive race for the Republican
4:20
nomination always a fantasy or how did how did it come to this well no if Ronda
4:26
santis had been a different person and by that I mean yes he went into it with kind of that populist Maga bent and he
4:34
was a strong governor of a swing state and had the kind of manly tendencies
4:41
that play well with certain parts of the base but he's fundamentally unlikable guy so you can't change that and
4:48
presidential politics runs on Charisma and personality as much if not more than
4:55
on policy so if he had been a different guy but you know that's like saying if a
5:00
frog had wings it wouldn't bump his ass a hoop in I just like come on as one says I frequently as one
5:07
always is as one says right but the people who really dig Trump are digging
5:14
the whole package they like the kind of crazy weird rambling rhetoric they like
5:21
his authoritarianism they like his insults they like a lot of that and you
5:27
can't just hand all of the rest of it off but not hand off any of the Charisma
5:33
or Persona and expect it to stick Ronda santis can't be a demagogue without any
5:40
kind of kind of compelling personality that's that just wasn't going to go anywhere for a party that has been
5:46
trained to love a celebrity TV host so you know I was thinking about this and I think that that sometimes because Donald
5:53
Trump is so unusual and strange it can sometimes feel like everything about him
5:59
is just sort of outside of historical memory and you know there the thing that that I was just sort of struck by
6:06
thinking back of the kind of successful creators of new coalitions and you know Trump I think has been a very successful
6:13
creator of a new Coalition for the Republican party is that it doesn't seem that there's like a strong track record
6:19
of being able to hand that Coalition on right like um you know you could say I
6:25
guess Ronald Reagan was able to hand his Coalition on to his successor George HW Bush but then for one for one election
6:31
right um and then you get to Clinton he was not able to hand over to Al Gore although that was a very close selection
6:38
as as we all recall and then Obama of course was unable to hand on to um to uh
6:43
to Hillary Clinton gosh how did I forget that name how quickly we forget so you
6:48
know like it struck me as I was as I was looking back at this history that like it's actually like a a particular
6:54
politician assembling a particular Coalition it's very hard to hand that Coalition off off to anybody else right
7:01
and it's particularly hard if that politician has like not left the national state right like Obama was hand
7:07
it off to anyone but even if he did it would still be hard to hand off you know so so I don't know I'm curious what you
7:14
guys think because like I think there's this assumption that like Donald Trump is so special and that's part of why but
7:19
like it actually might not be the case that this may just be like a problem of politics I I think one reason that
7:26
people have people on the right especially people who are into Dan santis have imagined some kind of
7:33
trumpism without Trump is that there is this kind of populous nationalist thing
7:39
going on all over the Western World yeah so it seems from that perspective it seems like some of what Trump did should
7:46
be reproducible because you can see versions of it in you know France Italy
7:52
wherever you want to look but yes trying to do it while the prior while the prior
7:58
embodiment of that Coalition is still very much on the stage and doesn't want to pass the Baton is a bit of a
8:05
challenge and that that also shows the sort of the Dilemma that people like DeSantis and Haley faced in this
8:12
campaign like one thing they could have done I mean this is kind of crazy very unorthodox but like they could have
8:18
actually run against Trump like they had this dilemma right they know that a huge chunk of the party loves Trump but they
8:24
also are trying to beat Trump so what do they do they can go hard against Trump
8:29
like Chris Christie right they can suck up to Trump like VI ramaswami you know what do those two guys both have in
8:35
common they're both already out so what did disantis and Haley do they just kind of danced around him they stayed in this
8:42
murky middle you know and that might help them do better than Christi and ramaswami but it almost guarantees
8:48
they're not going to win DeSantis as you said Ross he's like I'm trumpism without Trump right I'm Trump without the
8:53
baggage Haley is like he was the right guy at the right time but maybe someone younger is better better you know and
8:59
Chaos just kind of follows him like a like a fairy godmother you know I don't I mean it's just like being his whole
9:06
plan right you know and and so they don't offer an alternative to Trump except in this very vague way like I
9:11
have a different I'm Trump but with a different attitude or I'm Trump but younger and Republican voters love
9:18
Trump's attitude and don't care about his age so it doesn't seem like right except maybe at the very very end like
9:23
the night before Iowa you know did they actually try to run against him but I think that the other thing is that you
9:29
know if you sort of zoom out like you have to have a story for like why you want to be president you know and why
9:35
people should pick you you have to have an idea and like I guess that's why I sort of started with this Coalition
9:40
question because a coalition like builds around somebody who can be a kind of Pi
9:46
Piper right who plays a new tune that people hear and decide that they want to follow um and trying to be like X but
9:55
with Y you know um that's not playing a new tune and I is there an example of someone who's successfully become
10:03
president by saying I'm going to be like X but like you know less charismatic or
10:08
more competent that's not how presidential politics in the United States works that's not how how coalitions get built um I don't see how
10:15
any of the candidates that were vying to defeat Donald Trump had any sort of
10:21
message or idea of what Coalition they could build that would be separate and different from the one that that Trump
10:28
clearly already owned I mean so to play devil's advocate for a minute right I I don't disagree
10:34
with any of the critiques of where D STIs ended up but DeSantis had a story or he thought
10:41
he did right when he started running he was he his story was one he was a big
10:47
winner uh in a party that has lost a lot of winnable elections in the Trump era
10:54
Dan santis didn't just win he won big he expanded the Republican Coalition in Florida he's passing lots of things that
11:00
conservatives like through the Florida legislature with this kind of brand as a
11:06
competent governor who handled covid better than the blue states did I know this is highly contested but this was
11:13
obviously part of his narrative right and who was picking who was really good at picking a fight with the excesses of
11:20
the left and that you know as narratives go that obviously has a it doesn't have sort of a single thing it has a lot of
11:27
different pieces but I I think D santis thought that he was going to be a little bit like George W Bush when he ran for
11:34
president which is to say look the Republican party in DC is dysfunctional Trump ended up being part of the
11:41
dysfunction I'm a a popular Governor from a big state who knows how to get
11:47
things done and has a sort of you know a different brand than other people in the
11:52
rest of the party I think that's what he was thinking and we've been talking about Ronda santis but of course what
11:57
happened in Iowa is that Dan santis got you know about half of the not Trump vote and the other half went to Nikki
12:04
Haley so Dan santis got the conservatives who didn't want to vote for Trump and Haley got the moderates
12:10
and some Independents who didn't want to vote for Trump so now Haley gets her chance and going into New Hampshire into
12:17
state where famously John McCain was able to upset George W bush not withstanding Bush's charm with a
12:25
coalition that included a lot of moderates and independents so so now we need you know you failed me with excitement
12:31
about Iowa can you give me some excitement about New Hampshire can Nikki Haley win New Hampshire probably not but
12:40
probably not means means possibly yes possibly possibly yes yeah it's certainly possible and it would
12:45
certainly be interesting it's a you know I do think that that Iowa and New Hampshire do offer us a really
12:51
interesting kind of core sample of different parts of the Republican base so I think it'll be a fascinating um
12:56
result and seeing you know sort of what's at the Waters Edge for Trump well in the latest polls Dan santis is is
13:03
like what at five or six% I mean that's not he's not really attempting to compete there I mean one thing about
13:10
Iowa like it's great to win Iowa I'm sure right it's also useful to remember that you know nominee Ted Cruz Rick
13:15
Santorum and Mike Huckabee they all won Iowa they all got swamped in New Hampshire but I mean you know if you
13:21
look at polls Nicki Haley has a much better shot in New Hampshire than she did in Iowa so you know it's definitely
13:28
not a that she's going to to lose New Hampshire you want to tear down New Hampshire Ross or shall I well it suff
13:35
University Boston Globe pole of likely New Hampshire voters has Trump 50 Haley
13:41
34 so that's that's that's much much closer than she was in Iowa you know
13:46
this is true yeah but there had been there had been polls showing them much much more yeah like like seven seven seven points yeah those were likely
13:53
Republican voters or those were likely voters who will turn out in the Republican primary are they registered Republic an cuz that's the thing about
14:00
New Hampshire no this one includes Independence and Haley is winning winning Independence okay that is
14:05
actually a big red flag for her because what makes New Hampshire difficult when
14:11
you're looking at the broader picture you have all these UND declared independent moderates who can just show
14:17
up the day of and you know vote however the spirit moves them in whichever primary they have felt like that does
14:25
not necessarily reflect the Republic can base anywhere else much so even if Nikki
14:32
wins it there that doesn't that doesn't tell us that much all right well on that note why don't we talk about whether
14:38
there's anything that Nikki Haley or Ronda santis or the Supreme Court or God
14:43
himself could do to prevent Donald Trump from being the Republican nominee but we'll do that right after the break stay
14:50
with us we'll be right [Music]
14:57
back [Music]
15:11
[Music]
15:17
and we're back so guys before the break I had mentioned the latest poll from New Hampshire showing Donald Trump easily
15:24
defeating Nikki Haley but notably even in that really good for Trump poll he
15:30
still has 50% of the vote which is about what he had when all the counting was done in Iowa which would mean that in
15:37
both of the first two Republican states to vote at least around half of the
15:42
primary electorate seems open to voting for somebody else if you guys were in
15:48
charge of Nikki Haley's campaign right now your task in the next month is to
15:54
get that 50% of the party that's open to someone else to vote for you how would
16:00
you do it what would you do is it just impossible it can't be done you can't unite the disantis and Haley factions
16:07
one one question that I'd have is that 50% is not never Trump right that 50% is
16:12
H you know if there's an alternative I'd consider it and so I think that let's say miraculously Ronda santis decides to
16:20
drop out uh today and he's not in the race where do we think tanis's voters are likely to go I have a feeling that
16:27
more of them will go to Trump than would go to to Nikki Haley so I think in some ways even though she is the sort of
16:34
embodiment of the quote unquote moderate although I certainly don't consider her record to be moderate regretting on a
16:39
curve oh yeah sort of like acceptable post Trump nominee to the so-called establishment I don't see how she gets
16:48
very much of the available vote that would be open to Donald Trump to come to her I mean to me that's the sort of the
16:54
big question is how does she get that those people who are kind of okay with with Trump and on the more conservative
17:00
side of things I'm interested in that 50% too Lydia and how you unpack it
17:05
first of all to look at Trump's victory in Iowa as anything but like what it is
17:12
which is the biggest Republican blowout in the history of the Iowa caucuses and try to find like a well maybe actually
17:19
it shows that a lot of people don't like him seems I'm not so persuaded by that
17:24
especially what what what did Vias Swami get close to 8% his whole campaign was about being pro Trump so you have to
17:32
assume that a lot of his voters go to Trump as you mentioned a lot of desantis's Voters would go to Trump if D
17:37
santis Drops out soon as may very well happen then suddenly it's well above 50
17:43
you know it's not quite Sadam Hussein you know uh vote getting um but it's
17:48
very large it's 6535 I think if you just did head-to-head Haley Trump the rest of the way that's what you'd get yeah and
17:55
so Dan santis and Haley will probably when they drop out will endorse Trump anyway yeah no they certainly will the
18:01
only person who probably won't endorse Trump is maybe like Chris Christie Chris Christie will not endorse Trump the only flaw with your analysis Carlos is that
18:08
Trump is an incumbent yes he's running a primary he has Challengers he's not but he is running effectively asn't he no no
18:14
no no no no no no he's not it seems like trying too hard to say like in effect he's like an incumbent and by incumbent
18:21
measures you know he's not doing as well as we would have thought I'm not trying to I'm not trying to diminish or I'm not
18:27
you know I'm not arguing either way I'm I'm actually just interested it is striking that for such a formidable
18:34
political force Trump is I think a really unique figure in our politics who
18:40
has this Aura of invincibility and inevitability basically half of his party is like open to somebody else but
18:46
I think that that's a soft open I don't think it's like oh yeah we're never going to vote for Trump and I think that ultimately those people will align
18:52
around Trump because ultimately I think the party believes he's a winner I see the 50% and think it is gargantuan I
18:58
don't think it is a sign of weakness well Ross what do you think I mean Joe Biden is an actual incumbent yes and at
19:04
the moment we're all assuming that he's going to win over Dean Phillips and MaryAnn Williamson by something like 95
19:10
to5 so Trump is not inevitable in that way I think that's all that we're
19:17
suggesting by sort of floating this figure and I mean I think in 2016 when Trump was not a 50% guy he was
19:24
a 35 to 40% guy there was a work where some kind of weird alliance
19:32
between probably Cruz and Rubio which was talked about by their campaigns I believe might have successfully derailed
19:39
him I think Haley and DeSantis are just too weak in different ways Trump's
19:44
Coalition is too large for that to work but also it's just ambition I I think Haley probably we you know we talked
19:52
about her as a Vice Presidential nominee I think her taking sort of extreme steps
19:57
to form an anti-trump Coalition would endanger whatever
20:04
chances she has of being Trump's running mate and she's not going to do that and I'm sure Dan santis is thinking to
20:09
himself I will come back and run in 2028 when of course Trump will actually
20:14
run again himself after losing this time not not as not as an incumbent Trump will lose to Biden and he will be back
20:21
in 2028 okay so nobody seems to think that Nikki Haley even if she wins New
20:26
Hampshire can stop Trump so is there anything that can stop Trump is there a possibility that the Supreme Court will
20:33
prevent Trump from being the Republican nominee no I think it's actually not Unthinkable that there will be some kind
20:39
of adverse ruling could there be a majority on the Supreme Court that like doesn't want Donald Trump to be able to
20:45
run for president and can find a reason to keep him from running for president are there you know legitimate arguments
20:52
that could be marshalled about the fundamentally countermajoritarian protections that are
20:57
in the Constitution absolutely how would the country respond to that I think there would definitely be a very very
21:03
strong response from Trump's bace well I mean I I think you could look at the landscape and say actually maybe not
21:10
very much would follow from this yes Trump was able to stir up a protest that
21:15
turned into a mob once on January 6th but since then it's not like we have you
21:21
know million man marches in the cities of this country by people who think Joe
21:27
Biden is not the legit president Trump's record of actually stirring up people
21:32
and getting them to actually take to the streets as opposed to just voting for him is not incredibly strong trumpism is
21:39
not a mass protest move he only managed to f one Insurrection that's one
21:44
Insurrection and Ross doesn't even really believe it counts as an Insurrection well that's why I think it's different with the impeachment
21:50
versus the Supreme Court he has been tried in Congress and acquitted of being
21:56
accused of fting an Insurrection which is a different Prospect than the Supreme Court ruling that he participated in an
22:03
Insurrection Ross do you know how it ended do you know how it how um how January 6 um ended how the violence
22:10
stopped Trump told them to go home right so to to say that it only
22:16
happened once to me feels um a little a little disingenuous about the the
22:23
ability for something to happen again Trump told him to leave because he a great Patriot and didn't want any
22:29
violence Carlos I'm not optimistic about what'll happen in the case of an adverse
22:36
ruling against him in the Supreme Court just to sort of step back a bit I mean
22:41
like I think what lies at the core of this for me is this question is Trump
22:47
unique would essentially taking him out of the process like cool the fever and lead us back to a more kind of normal
22:54
political landscape I mean you could imagine a future in which you know Donald Trump is disqualified from
22:59
running maybe Nikki Haley wins maybe Joe Biden manages to squeak it out and and wins against Nikki Haley or or Rhonda
23:06
santis like fine if Trump were disqualified Nikki Haley would not be the Republican nominee someone will pick
23:11
up the torch right like JD Vance will pick it up and run in the next election perhaps even challenging president Nikki
23:18
Haley for being insufficiently aligned with the base but I'm curious if you guys think I mean is Trump uniquely
23:24
dangerous you know that the fact that no one has been able to essentially pick up his mantle and run with it despite all
23:30
of his difficulties makes me wonder um you know the idea does you know Trump ISM without Trump have a future no but I
23:37
think it's a good question like there are pieces of trumpism that existed well before Trump as Ross is quick to remind
23:44
us like he has Unleashed a certain kind of populism and brought it to the
23:50
Forefront this sort of thing has been picked up by other people including JD Vance who are very different
23:56
dispositionally or politically than Trump now I I've seen Vance on the stump he ain't all that but
24:03
there are plenty of people out there and while Trump is dangerous in his
24:08
particular way there could be somebody else out there who's dangerous in a different kind of way the way I see this
24:14
particular era ending is the wrong word but let's say transitioning is that
24:21
liberals and Democrats and especially sort of Centrist Mandarin Elites need to
24:28
reconcile themselves to the idea that certain aspects of populism are just
24:33
going to be part of democratic politics from now on you're never not going to have a republican nominee who is willing
24:42
to build a wall along the US Mexico border like that's just going to be a feature of politics you're never not
24:47
probably going to have a republican nominee who doesn't want to root out Dei programs in Elite universities that's
24:54
not going away I you know I could go down a list of things that liberals consider deplorable that are not going
25:00
away what you want to go away is the special addition that Trump gives you
25:06
that culminated in January 6th of refusing to accept election results and being totally
25:12
Shameless in your sort of flagrant misbehavior like yeah you'll get some other form of populism and liberals will
25:19
hate it but it will just want to build the wall it won't also have you know Sydney Powell in there talking about
25:26
hacked voting machines what you'll have is you'll have something that we're experiencing right now which is the
25:32
exciting thrill of Ronda santis on the campaign Trail you will have a normal
25:38
politician who's going out and trying to persuade people with his or her limited Charisma like lack of whatever that
25:45
magic celebrity thing that Trump has trying to actually sell these policies so I agree with you I think those are
25:51
all going to be features of our politics for a very long time but like they are not working for Ronda santis he visited
25:58
all 99 counties and barely scraped 20% in the Iowa um caucuses and if you look
26:03
at the record of politicians who are not Trump trying to play the Trump game and
26:10
trying to get into office at the state level like it's not a happy record I mean particularly not in swing States so
26:16
I actually am not persuaded I think that the ideas are going to be there and these policies are going to be there but
26:21
I actually don't think the ideas and the policies are what matter I think it's the Swagger I think it's the attitude and I think that a lot of low propensity
26:28
voters who turn out for Trump because they just like the guy who are not going to turn out you know when the candidate
26:35
is you know JD Vance or Ronda santis or whoever else yeah it's going to take another special man meeting his moment
26:41
or woman if you know you can get that through the Republican party I don't know I don't know it's not going to just
26:46
be anybody with those policies well some many of those policies are just popular which is why DeSantis despite his
26:53
Charisma deficit was able to be elected governor of Florida land not of the United States right I mean Ross I agree
27:00
with you 100% that those those are just going to be features of American
27:06
politics for a long time to come I'm not as persuaded by the notion
27:14
that that somehow it can stop there that it can just stop at the
27:19
policies which is in the end a normal democratic debate over substantive questions without saying you know
27:26
without holding on to the part that you don't like because guess who doesn't
27:33
make that clear distinction voters if you looked at Iowa and some of the um
27:39
entrance polls about 60% or more of the voters did not accept that Biden was a
27:45
legitimate President we are not at a place where the voters are making that distinction between the policies and not
27:53
accepting legitimacy of Elections being in two different universes so you know
27:58
it's not just the court right it's not just how will people respond depending what the court does if Trump is a
28:04
convicted felon before the election what will that do well the effect of the indictments

28:41
[Music] and we're back and finally it's time for
28:48

29:02
Doggers which I will now unpack for you sounds spicy from now through the end of
29:08
January the fine folks at Oscar Meyer are accepting applications to join the
29:15
company's 37th class of wiener mobile drivers now please tell me you people
29:20
have seen these you know what the wiener mobile is who's seeing on the road anyone anyone you got to get out of more
29:27
just I think I know what the Wier mobile is oh for God's sake so the wiener
29:32
mobile has been on the road some version of it since 1936 it is a 27 ft long hot
29:40
dog car they are absolutely glorious I used to see these driving through the South when I would like be on the
29:46
highways and now I love learning about quirky weirdo jobs and what they entail
29:52
you know and how people wind up in them dog food taster golf ball diver cry crime scene cleaner all these things
29:59
these are the jobs that make America interesting but becoming a hot dooger is
30:06
just the best and it is apparently quite competitive and very serious business
30:11
fewer than 1% of applicants get selected which the company is quick to point out
30:17
makes it harder than getting into an Ivy League school it's a year-long gig you
30:23
travel the country you drive like 20,000 M on average you get to do things like
30:28
preside over weddings in Vegas kick it in Puerto Rico you hand out weer mobile
30:34
whistles which if anybody's looking for an early birth is this ending with your
30:41

30:48

30:55
