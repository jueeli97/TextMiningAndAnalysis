Trump 2.0: ‘A Blueprint for Retribution’


0:00
I think of myself as the designated Survivor of moo like if all else goes
0:05
wrong we can ask that guy to do something yeah Deputy under secretary
0:12
you do have a striking resemblance to uh to kefir Southerland totally perfect you're like the Latin
0:18
kefir oh my God from New York Times opinion I'm Ross
0:25
D I'm Michelle coddle I'm Carlos Lozada and I'm Lydia green and this is matter
0:32
of [Music]
0:38
opinion so this week whether America likes it or not has been something of an
0:44
inflection point kicking us off for the real start of the general election
0:51
campaign come on now is this really the kickoff haven't we haven't we been in
0:57
the kickoff for a long time sh up the pageantry of democracy is at work
1:02
President Biden is essentially beginning his campaign this week with his State of
1:08
the Union Address and by the way we are taping this before his speech so if he
1:13
announces the colonization of Mars we apologize for not covering it it's always about the aliens also this week
1:19
the Supreme Court to no sensible person surprise ruled unanimously that states
1:25
can't keep did you like how I slipped that in 9 to zero I'm going to say that again 9 to0 ruled that states can't keep
1:32
Donald Trump off their ballots and then Super Tuesday's results made it unambiguous Donald Trump is going to be
1:39
the Republican nominee and then we have a lot of polling including from our own
1:45
New York Times Cen College poll that shows Donald Trump consistently ahead of
1:51
Biden to the point where if the election were being held today and I know it's not save your voicemails uh there is a very good
1:57
chance that Donald Trump could be returned Grover Cleveland style to the White House oh sweet Jesus so that's
2:03
what we're going to talk about today I'm hyping it up Donald Trump's second term
2:08
what would it look like and fortunately the one of us who reads Carlos lozana
2:13
has been doing some deep reading to try and answer this question because it's
2:18
not the case that there is a plan for a trump second term there are many plans but there is one particularly detailed
2:25
plan 887 pages I think so Carlos start us off what is this plan and how could
2:31
it help illuminate Trump round two you know you all could read it also like
2:37
it's there that's that's what we keep you around for Carlos maybe I have read it Carlos maybe I ghost wrote it who
2:44
knows there are some definitely like you know moments where I get a whiff of of doit um in the in the in the
2:51
pages a stench the dation you said stench I said whiff mine was Kinder so
2:57
okay it's not the plan for a second Trump term as you say it is a plan uh the Heritage Foundation which is a
3:03
longtime conservative think tank in Washington has partnered with a multitude of other conservative
3:09
activists and thinkers to put together something called project 2025 which is a plan to recruit and
3:16
train an Army in their words of conservatives to staff the federal government in a next conservative
3:22
Administration part of that project is this 887 page book called mandate for
3:28
leadership which basically runs through the executive branch one Department agency and office at a time very
3:35
methodically and explains how they want to remake it all the Trump campaign has not endorsed it nor has project 2025
3:42
officially endorsed Trump uh the book emphasizes that it supports the next conservative president whoever that may
3:49
be whoever he or she may be whoever he or she may be exactly and um in fact
3:54
Trump is mentioned uh about 300 times in the book Nikki Haley but once and we
4:00
should note that Nikki Haley dropped out this week um she suspended her her campaign so yeah yes she did um maybe
4:06
because she saw that one mention in project uh 2025 um but there's two things that stand out for me first the
4:13
document's very existence is an admission that the first Trump Administration was not really prepared
4:19
to govern on day one and they don't want to repeat that the book says up front it is a quote unified effort to be ready
4:25
for the next conservative Administration to govern at 12:00 noon January 20th 2025 and the people who are writing it
4:32
are people who hope to staff that new Administration second despite all the rhetoric in this book and on the right
4:38
about the need to dismantle the administrative State and downsize the out- of control Federal bureaucracy
4:45
judging from this particular plan I really don't think that's the burning ambition here they don't want to kill
4:51
the administrative State they want to seize it you know one of the big tasks at hand is to you know flood the Zone
4:58
with political appointees who will oversee manage and in some cases push out the sort of longtime
5:06
career civil servants so that kind of um overt politicizing of all sorts of
5:12
functions of government even functions that you would think require sort of more substantive expertise um is a a big
5:20
part of this of this initiative and so what then are those newly appointed
5:27
civil servants going to do mhm I mean I know it's 887 pages but what what jumped
5:34
out at you as like two two or three things that yeah would be possible through this new GOP Le bureaucracy that
5:42
weren't possible before for Republicans um one that you see kind of
5:48
scattered throughout the whole document is the manipulation and politicizing of
5:55
government data collection right that sounds super wonky but I think it's really important for instance they want
6:02
HHS the Department of Health and Human Services which they're they're kind of rebranding as the department of life um
6:07
to gather detailed state level data on abortion including exactly how many
6:13
abortions take place in each state at what stage of pregnancy for what reason
6:18
um what method is used at the same time they want to prohibit collection of employment statistics based on race and
6:26
ethnicity they also don't want the CDC to collect any data on on gender identity um the last one I'll mention is
6:34
the political appointees in the Department of Justice are an especially important part of this story they want
6:42
to flood doj with political appointments beyond the traditional place where where that happens which is the Office of the
6:49
Attorney General and and the and the deputy attorney general they keep emphasizing that the Department of
6:55
Justice is under the direction and control of the president and that litigation decisions need to be
7:00
consistent with the president's agenda so those are some ways in which the the
7:06
political appointments can have a very tangible effect on the workings of the federal government again according to
7:13
this particular effort project 2025 which I I suspect may have some
7:19
influence if only as kind of an off-the-shelf governing plan for a potential president who does not have a
7:25
lot of interest in developing one on his own yeah it's sort of hard to get that excited about this document as a
7:30
blueprint for a future Trump Administration in some ways just because I think one of the most important things
7:35
that we know about Trump is that he hates the idea that someone else is in
7:41
charge like the notion that he is a marionette who's being controlled by
7:46
unseen powers and um you know I don't I don't get the sense that Trump really
7:51
cares a whole lot about governing or policy um you know he's definitely interested in Vengeance and he certainly
7:58
sees a second term as a way to to escape his you know many and and and manifold legal troubles but I just I have a
8:04
significant amount of skepticism that this document will end up you know having a a great deal of influence in
8:11
the Trump Administration see what makes me nervous though is that this document isn't telling him what to do it's
8:17
telling him how to do what he already wants to do and the fact that it is so
8:22
eyeg glazing detailed and Technical and wonky
8:28
that only Carlos will sit down and read it in its entirety perhaps in the entire
8:33
United States now I I know one other person I know one other person who read it yes uh Harold Myerson at the American
8:40
Prospect read this so you and have suffered through this together but
8:45
that's what makes me nervous though is that it's not telling him what to do it's how you know Trump has said to his
8:51
loyalist I am your retribution so maybe we should just look at this as a blueprint for Retribution and I think
8:58
that point speaks to Lydia's skepticism about the the document which which I
9:03
think is warranted I mean the the greatest obstacle to a cerent vision of trumpism has always been the first the
9:11
first five letters of trumpism right it's always been Trump you know and there's even moments in this document
9:16
when you think that they're you know really carving out a very sort of extreme position and then Trump says
9:21
something the next day that that makes it seem tame but precisely because of what you're talking about Lydia about
9:28
Trump's you know interest in exacting Vengeance on behalf of the people is why
9:34
the the politicizing of the justice department is especially significant oh
9:39
yeah that part's definitely going to happen yeah yeah you're comfortable with that I wanted to pull us up a little bit
9:46
it's notable right that we have now been talking for 10 or 15 minutes about what Trump is going to do in his second term
9:52
and we haven't talked about any of the actual major policy issues that normally
9:58
are the most important part of what a president does so I wanted to ask each of you guys to talk about whether you
10:05
think there's a particular policy area the economy foreign policy domestic policy and so on where you want to make
10:11
a prediction about what you think the second Trump Administration will
10:16
actually bring like Trump is not going to run for president exclusively saying
10:21
I will deliver some politicized prosecutions right he's he's going to end up you know when he gives his big
10:26
convention speech he's going to end up making promis on economic policy domestic policy and so on what do you
10:32
guys actually foresee on those big fronts Lydia no let's let Michelle start
10:39
I don't want to Michelle and it can just be what you're most afraid of oh those are two different things most looking
10:45
forward to so so the problem with trying to figure out Trump's policies and and
10:50
actually I think you're wrong I think his first run for president was all about lock her up which was promising to
10:59
prosecute Hillary Clinton once he got in office now which happen this speaks to
11:04
the problem with Trump did he lock her up no the guy's a raver he says whatever
11:09
pops into his mind at the time like say we should have covid patients drink disinfectant or whatever tickles is
11:16
fancy at the moment get Mexico play pay for the wall Mexico's going to pay for that wall or what was the book that was
11:22
suggesting he wanted Moes on the border I don't know this that was Mike shear and Julie Davis's book Border Wars once
11:27
you get down of so like the problem is he says all
11:34
this crazy stuff but you never know like what he's going to latch on to what's going to strike his chaotic brain and
11:41
become a fixation like actually trying to build that border wall but so one of the things that I find
11:49
particularly noteworthy is that if he does follow through on this talk of making liberal use of the Insurrection
11:57
act to dispatch the military against Americans say frequently and
12:02
unilaterally calling out the National Guard to go into whatever cities he sees
12:07
fit that's going to be something special uh Michelle you mean like to you know try try to stand down protest movements
12:14
is that what you're talking about well there's so many ways that this could actually be used fighting crime in
12:19
cities without being asked to get involved by the local authorities in question is one of the things that has
12:26
specifically been flagged and you can say oh well you know we all talk or
12:31
whatever but at the same time he then does stuff that no president would have
12:38
ever dreamed of before you know like just firing inspector's General whenever he felt like it or fomenting an
12:44
Insurrection so you can't rule it out and it's always best to take him both
12:50
literally and seriously when you're thinking through worst case scenarios but so so the concrete I I just want to
12:57
bring this to like a concrete prediction right so you're so no no I'm not predicting that he'll do you ask what do
13:02
I worry about well I was starting I was asking for predictions then I left you the out of something you afraid of and
13:08
you took it I'm taking it but I'm trying to bring it to a scenario right so what you were worried about is a world where
13:14
Trump is reelected there are let's say around his inauguration huge George
13:19
Floyd era level protests in major American cities and Trump orders the National Guard federalized to bring
13:26
order to those cities you know you cannot bully me into being that specific
13:32
yes that would be bad but it's also going to be bad if he decides to wake up one morning and say you know what San
13:37
Francisco is a pit let me just send the military in there to sweep whatever I don't like out even if the local
13:44
authorities have no desire for that or this week you know Chicago's irritating
13:49
me maybe I'm going to decide to send troops in there and if you want to know
13:54
what I think he's going to do I think the easiest thing is he's going to like you know reinstate his Muslim band and
14:00
start making plans for all these kind of crack down on immigration stuff MH all
14:06
right liia yeah I'm very concerned about personal Liberty and bodily autonomy and
14:13
and privacy I feel like those are areas where um you know Trump because he has
14:18
this reputation as a libertine who doesn't really care that much about abortion or birth control or things like
14:24
that and I think that people assume that that means that he'll be a kind of moderating influence and of course he
14:29
said you know according to reporting by our colleagues you know he favors like a 16we abortion ban is like a nice
14:35
National compromise but I think that he is extremely inattentive to the ways in
14:41
which really kind of extreme policy can end up coming as a result of things like this um so are what are you what what is
14:48
what's the follow on from that that you're worried about I am worried about massive intrusions into people's
14:54
personal lives and personal choices and ways that they choose to live worried so what what is the intrus what's the
15:01
intrusion I I mean I'm I'm worried that hormonal birth control is it will become
15:06
inaccessible or regulated in onerous ways that make it very difficult to access I'm 16 we Federal ban said CH
15:14
support quietly I'm I'm worried about uh you know protections for same-sex couples and you know all all that whole
15:21
sort of Realm of things that were not supposed to be uh you know in in the mix
15:27
when we talked about things like the fall of dos but you know I think very much are in the mix Carlos so I think
15:33
that what we've heard from Trump's allies the excellent reporting by our
15:39
Newsroom colleagues on immigration related objectives is probably one of
15:46
the easier um quote unquote predictions that we could make you know efforts at
15:52
Mass deportations severe restriction of refugee admissions loosening up the kind
15:59
of norms and rules um by which immigration enforcement can enter churches schools workplaces I mean I
16:07
think those kind of things will be the things that we will we will likely see and we may see at least efforts at them
16:14
early on now if you ask me more broadly what am I sort of most concerned about
16:20
it's less a single policy Arena and more the kind of impulsiveness and unpredictability that Trump brings to an
16:27
array of different Arenas he makes major decisions often on a whim often with his
16:34
own personal interests in mind more than uh those of the nation this would Loom even larger in a second term um so you
16:41
know so that that is a concern to me because that involves unpredictability in in foreign policy for instance where
16:48
the stakes are absolutely existential so do we I I think it's interesting that
16:54
having canvas all of you no one no one has made an economic policy prediction
17:01
does he even care about Economic Policy well he talks about tariffs aside from a trade war with China yeah well I think
17:07
that is actually one of the areas where Trump has consistently cared about it you know in a very particular way that
17:14
views the global economy as a kind of competition Zero Sum game and so on he's
17:19
been saying that since the 80s right and he's returned to those ideas in 2024 um and to me you know I I having demanded
17:28
that you all make specific predictions I'm now I'll take moderator's privilege and say I I struggle to make a specific
17:35
prediction on economic policy because the well the simplest prediction would be Trump comes in and does what he is
17:42
promising to do which is Implement some kind of big tariff and he mixes that up
17:47
with some kind of conventional Republican tax cut the issue is you know
17:53
in a climate where inflation is still a big issue it's not at all clear that
17:58
that you know that that that Economic Policy makes any sense as a prescription
18:03
for the American situation but I think you know this is a point that some liberal commentators have made Matt
18:10
glacius keeps making it over and over right that like we're in a situation where Trump could get elected based on
18:17
economic discontents and so there should be much more attention paid to What
18:22
specifically he's promising to do on the economy well he wants his 10% tariff all
18:28
imported goods right that'll be great for that'll be great for people dealing with inflation one thing that's that's
18:34
interesting about project 2025 is that you know there's a lot of sort of uniformity in in views like there's like
18:41
one view on almost all of the issues but there's a few places where they kind of bracket in disagreements and one of
18:48
those is on trade policy you have Peter Navaro who was you know one of Trump's
18:53
trade gurus in the first term making the sort of very protectionist
18:59
case for Trump's trade policy and then you had some conservatives think you know the opposite and that actually you
19:05
know open trade is is a useful Economic Policy uh so you know there is at least
19:11
um a glimmer of some debate even in this kind of um supposed blueprint for a
19:16
second term yeah but in that case then it just depends on what Trump is feeling that morning that's one of those places where Lydia is correct he's not going to
19:23
take anybody's advice as to what he can do he's just going to like figure out who has plan for doing what he's feeling
19:30
that morning well or it depends on which cabinet secretary can swipe a plan that
19:35
Trump wants to do off his desk so that it doesn't actually get there'll be none of those right there'll be none there'll
19:41
be no grown-ups this time around all right let's take a break there and when we come back we're going to talk about
19:48
what would count as trumpian success so stay with
19:55
[Music] us [Music]
20:16
[Music] so let's go back to some of the specific worries that all of you have raised
20:24
because I think there's a sense that a second Trump term whatever it br on economic or foreign policy will
20:30
inevitably usher in some kind of let's say constitutional crisis right in some
20:36
form that Trump's desire to consolidate power whether he reads the 887 Pages or
20:42
not he clearly has some version of that desire and I just want I just thought we should talk about that a bit more and
20:51
sort of just for lightening things up well well just just to again try but trying to sort of be be specific about
20:59
how you guys if you imagine something like that as sort of a semi- inevitability how you imagine it
21:04
happening or if you don't you know what do we think an attempted trumpian consolidation of power/ attack on
21:12
Democracy looks like in a second term Ross I I want to know what you mean by constitutional crisis because so many
21:20
times we hear that thrown around it's all it's it's like a it's a very like cable TV friendly thing you know like
21:27
well if that happens it's a constitutional crisis right and it sounds super super sage and scary but
21:33
I'm more concerned by just steady quiet erosion of adherence to law right like
21:41
so here's um an example from from the project 2025 thing that just struck me because it was so just subtle the way it
21:48
was explained for instance it says that if the Secretary of Homeland Security decides that there is an actual or
21:55
anticipated sort of mass migration headed to you know to us borders and that it's presents urgent circumstances
22:02
then the secretary May issue whatever rules and regulations are deemed necessary for as long as necessary and
22:07
then it added this sentence at the end saying such rules and regulations uh should not be subject to the requirement
22:13
of the administrative procedure act which sounds really boring and unsexy right so I so couldn't possibly be
22:19
important so I found the administrative procedure act and and read it it was only nine pages um and um and and I
22:27
realized that it governed the process by which agency rules are subject to public comment and are also subject to review
22:32
by courts so by simply saying you know in this emergency situation as declared
22:38
by the president and the Secretary of homeless security what we do is unreviewable so much for check Balan
22:44
that is to me that's more what I'm concerned about than these big dramatic moments even though I am concerned about
22:50
the dramatic moments like say January 6 you know the the the unwillingness to accept the results of a legitimate
22:55
election you know like that's but I'm I'm more concerned about the nibbling away yes yes that is to me far more far
23:02
more significant than you know the the moments of high drama when there when there actually are mechanisms in place
23:09
you have the Supreme Court you have the military itself you know that won't perhaps let itself be used in certain
23:15
ways I always worry a little bit when I hear constitutional crisis because I think it focuses so much on like you
23:21
know the highest hanging fruit and not on the low hanging fruit I think that that one of the things that's most
23:26
troubling about the heritage document overall is the elevation of the executive that like removing things from
23:33
reviewability essentially elevates the presidency above the other branches of government to me that's the kind of like
23:40
Mega constitutional crisis right is like our constitution envisions a set of you know quite tensely held checks and
23:46
balances and this document in some ways by a Thousand Cuts erodes at those checks and balances in ways that lead to
23:53
a kind of slow rolling constitutional crisis so here's why I'm sort of Carlos
23:59
especially to your point like trying to focus us on the sharpest possible
24:05
conflicts we lived through four years of Donald Trump in office and what you saw
24:11
again and again in those first four years was um this did not actually happen but things like this happen some
24:17
Trump Aid or flunky or cabinet secretary might do something related to border
24:24
policy say we're doing this and they'd say and you know and by the way way you know we we think this falls under the
24:30
president's prerogatives and it's it shouldn't be reviewable by the courts but then someone would sue them and the
24:38
thing that they had done would be immediately tied down in litigation and there were a number of cases including I
24:45
think uh DACA the rules governing illegal aliens brought here as children
24:51
right where basically John Roberts ended up joining the Democrats to say you know
24:57
the Trump ad Administration can't do X or it can't do y and you know it would be the equivalent of saying sorry Donald
25:04
Trump you have fallen a foul of the administrative procedure act whether you like it or not and again and again
25:11
Trump's policy forays were sort of snared in this stuff because Trump was not good at running the government so
25:18
I'm interested in whether that changes in a second term and for it to change I
25:23
do think you would have to have some sort of moment where the administration says guess what we're doing this and
25:30
it's not reviewable and the Supreme Court says oh I'm sorry it is reviewable and the Trump Administration says fine
25:36
we're ignoring you that may be true but we can't assume that one term in the
25:44
White House hasn't given Trump a much better sense for his second time around
25:51
on how to manipulate the levers of of government the um if there's one thing we learn in all the big books on on the
25:57
Trump presidency like Peter Baker and Susan glasser's book The divider Maggie haberman's book confidence man it's that
26:05
you know pretty much by the second half of the first term he was much better at
26:11
manipulating the tools at his disposal in fact this was super weird but both of
26:16
those books separately invoke the same sort of Hollywood metaphor to explain
26:23
Trump's growing ability to use the federal government they both compare him to the Velociraptor in Jurassic Park who
26:30
like learned to open the door and like hunt his prey um I won't say that the
26:36
best metaphor to understand Trump is that of U you know a carnivorous Beast that terrifies children but but I I will
26:43
say that both in the way he staffs up and in the way he understands his own
26:50
power I don't think it's conspiratorial to imagine that a second term Trump um
26:56
would be far better equipped to get his way than a first term Trump he can open that door right I guess all all I would
27:03
say is just that for him to get his way he needs to be able to let's say win a
27:11
fight with the Supreme Court about Supreme Court about the administrative procedure act right and we think he's
27:16
read the administrative procedure act it doesn't matter he'll have people he'll have people who have but I'm kind of I'm
27:23
kind of with Carlos in that it's it's not the big breaking points it's it's the federal government obviously is this
27:30
huge sprawling bureaucratic machinery and you can make a lot of Mischief at
27:35
lower levels before it reaches something that the Supreme Court would have to
27:41
review or that the Supreme Court you know just gets overwhelmed trying to review if you're saying that there are
27:47
going to be several of these moments like you can do a lot of damage before it hits one of those breaking points I I
27:55
definitely understand that and I think that there's something to that um you know there was a very very wise piece in
28:01
Politico by the great uh Turkish journalist um asley a tbas and she's
28:07
someone whose work I've followed very closely over the years because over 20 years she's been chronicling what has
28:12
happened in turkey and kind of what it took to you know really kind of bring Turkish democracy to its knees and I and
28:20
I felt like you know a little bit reassured I mean she argues that it would take more than four years of trump
28:26
in order to kind of um you know do fatal damage to American democracy and you
28:31
know she points out a couple of forces that um will just elude Trump's control
28:37
and based on her experience in Turkey it took you know a decade to dismantle for example The Independent Media and you
28:44
know I think that that her conclusion which was you know that even in in an imperfect democracy like turkey it took more than a decade to dismantle the rule
28:51
of law and Donald Trump might try but he will find that it takes a long time to become a dictator um there's a lot lot
28:57
of space between you know dictator and authoritarian leading democratically
29:02
elected uh uh president but I don't know I don't know if any of you saw that piece but I found it a some somewhat
29:08
reassuring and it also sort of jived with with my experience in in other democracies that have found themselves
29:15
um becoming more autocratic well this brings me to kind of what Ross was asking about earlier it's kind of your
29:20
worst case scenario my worst case scenario is that Trump somehow convinces everyone that he deserves a third term
29:28
because you know that that first one got so messed up because of all the cheating that we wind up looking down the barrel
29:34
of like another eight years of this nonsense now do I think that's likely God I hope not but wait but wait no no
29:40
but but but how I want to push you Michelle towards a fear that's I think
29:46
if Trump convinces America that he should have a third term which would
29:51
require presumably an amendment to the United States Constitution or the
29:58
complete replacement of the entire Supreme Court somehow right like you're you're imagining to me at least a kind
30:05
of a level of power far exceeding you know the power that Victor Orban has or
30:10
something so I'm curious like what's something in between right I mean to me like listening to what Lydia was saying
30:17
you know the big difference between Trump and a lot of strongman figures in other countries is that Trump has never
30:23
been that popular he didn't win a majority of the popular vote in 2016 he's lost lots of times at The Ballot
30:30
Box now we are at a weird moment where he's doing better in the polls against Joe Biden than he's ever done before so
30:37
if we just run with that like Trump is reelected and then it's 2026 what do you think sort of a
30:45
concrete sign that he is actually transforming the country in His image would be what would a successful Trump
30:52
second term look like well that we've just kind of looked the other way way
30:57
while he does go after his political enemies with the justice department or
31:04
you know liberally employs the military against American citizens how's that do
31:10
that is that specific that's that's good that's good Carlos I guess for me the question is Success on Whose terms the
31:17
success according to the policy wonks and ideologues who put together you know dense plans for governance um or success
31:25
according to the president's own sort of political and legal interests I mean
31:30
like I I take as a sort of given as a as a sort of Benchmark for any functional
31:37
democracy that we should have Fierce battles in the policy Arena and um like you know a good bit of polarization
31:43
doesn't bother me like I I think it's important that we have you know sharply conflicting lines on policy debates but
31:50
if most of the country's political and emotional energy is instead focused on Trump himself rather than you know real
31:58
actual debates then I think Trump is winning period and the and the country is losing Lydia I think the thing that
32:04
really scares me is the thing that that Michelle uh pointed out you know that that there will be enormous amounts of
32:10
dissent and anger about the Trump Administration and you know various policies that they try to implement
32:16
there will be people who come out and try to protest them there will be people who try to exercise their first amendment rights in other ways and I'm
32:23
I'm very worried about violent reprisals um by various you know military forces within within
32:30
the government um that you know may or may not refuse to to take orders from Trump so that that that concerns me okay
32:37
I'm going to give myself the the last word here and just pick up on your analogy to other to other countries
32:44
Lydia because I think if you're worried about some kind of trumpian takeover
32:50
then for the you know a sort of longer run phenomenon that changes American
32:55
democracy in ways that at least liberals would not like the worst case scenario
33:01
is much more I think a scenario where we get two years into the Trump second term he's quite popular has a clear
33:08
successor where this is where I think his vice presidential pick is actually quite important isn't doing crazy things
33:15
like demanding a third term but you know has sort of done a lot of the behind the
33:20
scenes stuff that you guys are all very concerned about it's been sort of politically accepted and you're just
33:27
looking at a future where it seems like another leader in the mold of trump
33:33
could win presidential elections many times over going forward I think if you're worried about trumpism changing
33:38
democracy you have to worry most about a scenario where trumpism becomes really
33:43
popular which is has not yet happened but I suppose could so does it need to
33:49
be popular to win I think it I think trumpism needs to be popular to
33:54
change American democracy for the long term in the ways that liberal analogies
34:01
to other sort of populist governments around the world for those analogies to make sense yeah it has to be popular I
34:08
think so fear Trump's popularity well on that cheery note all right let's leave
34:14
it there and when we come back we'll be hot or cold on something maybe less
34:20
significant than a constitutional crisis stay with
34:25
