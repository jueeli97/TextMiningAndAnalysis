South Africa Confronts Israel and Its Own Democracy


0:01
from New York Times opinion I'm Lydia pgreen and this is matter of opinion South Africa
0:07
Edition that's right I'm going
0:13
rogue so over the past 10 days I've been reporting from South Africa which just
0:18
had a big election but that's not the only reason that South Africa's been in the news we've also been talking about
0:23
South Africa because of its advocacy for Palestinians and I've been thinking a lot about the meaning of South Africa
0:29
for the world 30 years after the end of Apartheid so we're trying something different today instead of chatting with
0:34
my co-hosts I've enlisted two other guests who've been a crucial part of my reporting one of them is Will Shoki
0:40
who's in studio with me here in Cape Town he's the editor-in-chief of one of my favorite magazines one that has
0:46
shaped a lot of my thinking it's called Africa as a country hi Will hi liia and my editor Max strer is joining us from
0:53
New York he's going to be asking us lots and lots of questions hi Max hi Lydia hi Will
1:00
all right Max I'm going to hand the Baton over to you let's let's talk um so one thing you didn't mention Lydia is
1:06
that you uh had been in South Africa before of course you were the bureau chief for the New York Times from 2011
1:13
to 2014 and so this is your first time back on a reporting trip since then and I'm really curious what your impressions
1:19
are coming back after after a decade to do reporting what's changed yeah you
1:24
know it turns out that the time that I spent in South Africa was a real hinge moment for the country so I got here
1:30
about you know a significant amount of time after South Africa had been liberated and there had been this
1:35
euphoric period post Liberation after 1994 where the kind of political and um
1:43
economic conditions globally were actually incredibly favorable to South Africa so it had been on this kind of
1:48
rise and there was this you know really optimistic story but around the time that I arrived and I swear this was just
1:54
a coincidence um things had really started to take kind of a darker turn you know inequality has actually grown
2:00
in South Africa over the past decade and and that growth has actually happened not just between black and white which
2:07
was always kind of a permanent feature of apartheid but there's been growing uh inequality between black people which I
2:13
think has really kind of changed the politics of the country so coming back 10 years later it's it's really kind of
2:20
extraordinary to see the decline actually unemployment is now at um you know basically
2:26
33% the government can't seem to keep the lights on there's rolling power Cuts you know violent crime is is a huge
2:33
problem in many areas especially where poor people live at the same time and this is I guess maybe my glass half full
2:40
observation you know South Africa continues to be a source of inspiration and real moral leadership you know the
2:45
the the global South in some ways the the entire decolonized world looks to South Africa as a place that is a symbol
2:53
of of leadership and of Liberation so you know trying to kind of take all of
2:58
that in and and come away with a coherent understanding of where South Africa is today has been really
3:03
interesting right I'm excited to get into a lot more of those specifics I'm curious well you know you've been in
3:08
South Africa for this period right and does Lydia's Impressions sort of track with your your experience there over the
3:14
last decade or so I think it does it's it's quite amusing that the last time ldia was here South Africa was at a
3:21
hinge point and the next time she's here for a reporting Trip South Africa is also at a hitch point so I'm wondering
3:28
if the problem is is I'm I'm only teasing maybe she's just a
3:34
good journalist uh she's I think she is I think she can tell when the Winds of Change of blowing but I think certainly
3:40
the story of the last 15 years in South Africa has been one of Decline and
3:46
regression but I think it's unclear as to whether or not that necessarily means
3:52
further decline or if this is perhaps maybe a kind of productive moment in South African history and it's kind of
3:59
both disconcerting but I think also interesting to start to speculate about
4:05
what might be in store for South Africans right so okay so so now we're talking about the election um we're
4:11
going to find out how thec the African National Congress Nelson Mandela's party which has been in power uh since the end
4:18
of a parthe is fairing what what's the Top Line what have we learned from this election so far Lydia well uh as as
4:26
we're recording this um on on Thursday the the trend seemed pretty clear there
4:32
had been a lot of speculation going into the election you know the big question was would thec fall below the 50% Mark
4:39
and lose their majority in the Parliament and the trend lines seem really really really clear that they are
4:45
going to be well below 50% and in fact could fall as low as 42% and so you know
4:51
effectively what that means is that the ANC will almost certainly come back into power and and be the the governing party
4:59
but it will have to do so in Coalition and there are a bunch of smaller parties that are going to be jockeying to exert
5:05
influence and find a way to take power alongside of thec um the academic
5:11
William gumed had a column in the Sunday paper here in which he described the voters of the African National Congress
5:18
as having a kind of trauma bond with the party um which which felt very apt and
5:23
appropo to me that um you know at the end of the day there is this kind of emotional attachment to the party that
5:30
ended apartheid and brought freedom and brought multi-racial democracy to South Africa and I think that was a part of me
5:37
in all of my conversations that sort of sensed that a lot of Voters were eventually going to come home to thec
5:43
and it doesn't seem like that's what's happening will if I can put you on the spot did you vote in this election I did
5:51
can I ask you um how you made your decision I mean maybe you want to talk about your trauma bond with thec um but
5:58
but but really I mean I'm curious how you went into this as a voter I think it was a difficult election to enter into
6:05
as a voter I think this idea of trauma bonding with the ANC is apt on the one
6:12
hand I think there's a real felt appreciation for the ANC across the
6:17
political Spectrum in South Africa regardless of what your party lines might be maybe it's not something that South Africans will acknowledge all the
6:24
time but I think people can recognize the triumphant role it played in The Liberation struggle and certainly kind
6:31
of for me as a as a voter I think the advocate Tima lay toi put it really aply
6:38
I thought in an interview with the financial times when he spoke about the anc's decline but I think made the
6:44
really compelling point about you know which other political party prizes
6:49
principles such as non-racialism non-t tribalism these kind of Universalist
6:55
values which I think defined movements of the anc's during the 20th century but
7:01
it's another question as to whether or not the ANC has lived up to them so I think heading to this election was very
7:07
difficult to make a vote because you don't really want to vote for the ANC you don't want to vote for reactionary
7:14
options and the smaller parties that are out there it's very hard to know whether or not they'll have enough traction
7:20
behind them for your vote to make a dent in the political landscape so it was very difficult to to come to a decision
7:28
well it's funny well because I think you you another phenomenon that I picked up on was a lot of people just didn't vote
7:34
I mean I spoke to many many young people particularly the kind of so-called bornfree generation of which you are a
7:40
member people born after 1994 who just said oh no I I'm not registered or I'm
7:45
not planning to vote what is there to vote for and that that kind of um apathy I think is quite worrying as well it's
7:51
quite worrying but I think I think it's also possibly maybe one reason to be
7:58
hopeful potentially there were 27 million people registered to vote in these elections but there
8:03
were also 14 million unregistered voting age South Africans who felt like none of
8:09
the options on the table spoke to them and in a way that's kind of a good thing because I think it's it's an indictment
8:17
on Party politics in South Africa I think many of the options if not all of
8:22
the options are fairly and inspiring but it shows you that South Africans are ripe for an inspiring political
8:29
alternative and they might decide to become organized in some way and produce
8:34
the alternative that might have a broader and larger resonance so I think
8:40
it it all remains to be seen I think that's so interesting I mean I really like hearing that um somewhat optimistic
8:45
gloss on the on the loss of the anc's majority because you know as I've been reading a lot of Western press uh
8:52
American British European press about the South African election over the last couple of weeks you see so frequently
8:58
this discourse of broken promises quote unquote or like failed dreams or or
9:03
whatever and it's interesting to hear your perspective on that and see something a little more positive or full
9:09
of possibility there I'm curious you know how do South Africans view themselves at this moment um are they
9:15
talking about failed promises or Broken Dreams or are they sort of saying you know this is our country this is where
9:22
we're going yeah I mean I'd love to hear will on this but you know my reporting was kind of a kaleidoscope of of
9:28
different perspectives you know I get the sense that people deeply understand
9:34
that this is a process that um building a democracy and and building a new country which is really what South
9:40
Africa is right the the country that was born in 1994 was a completely new country and you know in the grand scheme
9:47
of things when you look at you know the amount of time that we're talking about here which is just 30 years that's actually just a kind of Nano second in
9:53
the political development of a country um I think the thing that's harder is that you know there's been quite a
9:59
specific experience of of kind of downward Mobility um particularly for
10:04
those at the lower end of the economic spectrum so just just to give you one example I mean I I met so many older
10:11
people you know people who are in their 40s and 50s uh who had you know pretty good jobs often union jobs that were
10:17
stable that paid a decent wage um who had adult children who just couldn't find employment and so the kind of
10:24
traditional social role which is for the older generation and for the younger generation to have a better life than
10:29
the one before it had been completely reversed so you know I spoke to a nurse who was in this situation I spoke to a
10:35
mine worker who is in this situation who are sort of staring down their quote unquote golden years and thinking like
10:41
how am I going to take care of my children and grandchildren if I retire and that sense of of disappointment I
10:47
think does come from having experienced that initial period of growth of
10:53
possibility and also of delivery of government services so I I really do
10:58
think that that has had a profound impact on people's Outlook but it may not actually mean that they are giving
11:04
up on or rejecting you know politics per se there there's you know people who
11:09
can't find housing they're just taking land and building informal settlements on it and then they're organizing those
11:15
settlements into these very kind of Grassroots sort of small D Democratic committees that are cleaning up the
11:21
environment that are doing all these things so there is you know sort of outside of organized politics there is I
11:27
think a tremendous amount of Grassroots energy that you're seeing that isn't really captured when you talk to people
11:34
about what's happening in the overall political scene so it's it's a real mix I don't know will what do you think I
11:39
think you're absolutely right what's interesting and also kind of difficult to make sense of is also the Stark
11:48
generational differences um Lydia dropped the term earlier the Born Free generation who are people born after
11:55
1994 so these are South Africans with no experience or memory of apartate at
12:02
least the memory of apart dat is mediated to them by their parents by other family members by social
12:08
institutions and so I think for this generation the Broken Dreams failed
12:14
promises narrative both makes sense but also kind of doesn't resonate because
12:20
they came of age in a democratic South Africa and so I think you know the The
12:26
Fallout of of this election cycle regardless of what the results are would be interesting to sort of to suggest um
12:34
how South Africans understand the moment which I think is is one that feels like a different phase of our history one
12:40
that has is kind of exiting this narrative um that's framed by apartate
12:45
obviously the legacy of apartate is is very much alive and I think South Africans can pass that out eloquently
12:52
but it it feels like we're entering something new that is distinctly post aart dat um and I think understanding
12:59
what the terms of Engagement in that phase are I don't think we know quite as yet I mean there's something really
13:05
interesting to me in that in that talk about it's it's sort of making South Africa less exceptional in a way right
13:12
because totally look at your look elections in the United States or in Europe or all over the world where people are sort of feeling equally
13:19
disappointed by what the state has been able to provide for them where like younger Generations are sort of like
13:24
worried about economic precarity like that's a global story yeah absolutely
13:30
yeah and it's it's been interesting as as an American to have South Africans be you know honestly quite a bit more
13:36
concerned about our election in the United States than they are about about their
13:42
own and you know understandably so I mean you know when the United States sneezes the uh the entire world catches
13:48
a very bad case of the flu but it really it really does put that in in perspective and you know Max what you
13:54
say about exceptionalism I think is really important and you and I have talked about this in our conversations about my reporting here you know
14:00
exceptionalism can feel like a um you know like a real Boon when you're trying
14:06
to get something really hard done and that thing that needed to get done was ending a bar tide and um in the kind of
14:14
ordinary hurly Burly of moving forward and building a country and and having a competitive Democratic space
14:21
exceptionalism actually becomes a burden and it becomes an obstacle to moving forward and I think some of what we're
14:27
seeing in South Africa right now now is you know an abandonment of that exceptionalism narrative that to me
14:34
actually offers up some real liberatory possibilities you know if you're able to let go of the idea that you're so
14:41
special then maybe you can just kind of get on with it and um and build your Society with the tools that you have at
14:47
hand I think that is that is absolutely The Hope um I think you know we were talking about this earlier Lydia but
14:54
there's just I think there's a way in which South Africans are starting to realize that they're less exceptional
15:00
and this election feels like it's disabusing South Africans of that exceptionalism in significant part
15:07
because I think we we now no longer present our democracy as this
15:15
Ironclad robust institution that can withstand any challenge I think South
15:22
Africans one thing that I think was was quite uh striking and we still don't
15:28
quite know the turnout numbers are but it's very interesting to see a lot of South Africans voting with a sense of of
15:35
real kind of responsibility of oh democracy and its institutions and its
15:40
lifeblood isn't something that we can take for granted is something that is fragile and could be jeopardized and
15:48
disappear within a flash um and I think for me that's kind of the beginning of the exceptionalism narrative breaking
15:54
down in the sense that I think South Africans are are coming to appreciate um that democracy is this thing that you
16:00
have to tend to um years after you formally enter into it I think that's
16:06
all really really interesting and we're going to come back to these questions later of South Africa's democracy and
16:12
democracy globally um but for now let's take a quick break and when we're back we're going to dive into one of the
16:19
issues that has um played out in this election and also that has brought South Africa onto the world stage which is the
16:24
country stance on Israel's war in Gaza [Music]
16:45
[Music] so we focused on some of the internal
16:51
challenges for South Africa um in this election but of course the country has been on the world stage a lot recently
16:57
if you've been following the news for a very different reason South Africa has been a major player in the biggest International story of our day which is
17:04
uh the war in the Middle East Israel's assault on Gaza it was South Africa that brought genocide charges against Israel
17:10
to the international court of justice um Lydia can you fill us in explain what's happened so far what's the latest on
17:16
those charges what has South Africa done sure yeah so in January South Africa went to the international court of
17:22
justice which is of course the un's highest court and accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza and the
17:27
court found that um South Africa's case was at least in part plausible and at
17:33
that time had ordered Israel to take greater care and protect uh civilians in Gaza allowing in more Aid and so on then
17:40
as the Rafa incursion has begun uh South Africa went back to the court demanding that it halt the assault in Rafa in
17:47
order to uh protect civilians and this time the court took an even stronger action ruling that Israel must
17:53
immediately halt The Assault on Rafa um now of course the the court has no means of enforcing its ruling but you know
18:00
it's been a huge moment on the global stage and it really highlights the isolation of Israel but also the
18:07
isolation of the United States you know which I think thinks of itself as the guardian of the international
18:12
rules-based order and has really kind of found itself in a very awkward position uh viav those rules and that order uh as
18:20
this has played out in these courts yeah will I'm wondering if you can tell me a little more broadly why do you think it
18:26
was South Africa of all the countri is in the world that took this case to the icj to the international court of
18:34
justice I think the big reason is that our experience of fighting against
18:40
racial oppression is fairly recent it's not so far gone in our memories and it's
18:49
a living Heritage in South Africa and I think even during the anti-ap paritate
18:56
struggle there was a very strong affinity and closeness to the Palestinian Liberation struggle um sort
19:04
of in the Years immediately after democracy you know Nelsa Mandela famously said that the freedom of South
19:10
Africans is incomplete without the freedom of Palestinians and so I think there's that kind of organic resonance
19:16
that South Africans identify Palestinian Liberation as forming part of a
19:24
long-standing tradition of struggle against colonialism Against Racism and I
19:32
think that having experienced that very recently South Africans overwhelming
19:38
feel responsibility to stand up where they see a similar experience unfolding
19:44
internationally but it's not something that they can do without consequences
19:49
whether diplomatic or economic or whatever their case might be it's not as if there South Africa is not like every
19:55
other state in the world where it faces constraints in its foreign policy um but I think it reaching a point where
20:01
it was prepared to take this I think was also the product of of South Africans themselves exerting pressure on the
20:06
governments to to do something you know I think one thing that Skeptics or critics would say though is that there's
20:12
a there can be a little inconsistency or even hypocrisy to South Africa's foreign policy right that South Africa claims
20:19
that it's standing up for oppressed people but if you look at South Africa's position on the war in Ukraine it's very
20:25
much stood on the sidelines it's very conscientiously said we're not getting involved we're not taking sides here we're not going to stand up for the
20:31
little guy in that conflict um how do you how do you square that will how do
20:36
how do South Africans make sense of that I think it's a difficult thing to square I mean I do think it's it's an
20:43
example of inconsistency on the part of the South African government I think the South African government is still in its
20:50
experimental phase with this role that it's trying to cover out for itself as
20:55
uh for lack of a better word moral or normative super superpower and I think
21:00
that there was just tremendous reluctance to quote unquote side with
21:06
Ukraine so to speak because to do so felt as if it was to position oneself in
21:14
Alliance with the west and kind of participate in what I think a lot of
21:21
people in the global South do experience as a proxy conflict um that is being
21:27
contested by two great Powers at the expense of ukrainians and I think that's
21:33
that's maybe the more non-aligned position um but I think it's it's just
21:38
uh it's awkward um there's a lot of You Know The Enemy of My Enemy is is my friend going on um but I think what
21:46
Palestine has been has been an opportunity for the South African government to try and develop a much
21:52
more sophisticated foreign policy kind of trying to really fine-tune what it
21:58
means means to be non-aligned in this growing multi-polar order I don't think
22:04
it's quite found the language yet to explain how it's been in relation to
22:10
Israel Palestine versus how it's been in relation to to Ukraine but I think it remains to be to seeing whether they can
22:16
kind of square that Circle or maybe they might sort of uh account for that mistake in the past I'm not quite sure
22:24
yeah it's it's funny well like as you were speaking I was just thinking about um I find the accusation of hypocrisy to
22:29
be one of the least um serious and impressive accusations in the world right because to be human is to be a
22:35
hypocrite right we all we all sort of go against our principles and you know do the needful in the moment and act as we
22:41
need to you know based on our current needs and situation um because you know that's life but I also think the ability
22:47
to get away with hypocrisy is actually a measure of power oh yeah you know I I think that the United States from the
22:54
South African perspective and again you know I'm I'm less talking about the government but the conversations that I've had with people in the Palestine
23:01
movement here in South Africa what they'll say is you know why is the US so able to condemn the bombing of of
23:08
hospitals the killing of children in Ukraine and unable to raise its voice in
23:14
the same way in in the case of of Gaza and so I I I think that in some ways
23:19
like the ability to carry out a foreign policy that contains elements of what we might call hypocrisy is a measure of a
23:27
certain kind of global ambition and to add to that I think you know part of the reluctance on the part of not only the
23:33
South African government but I think other governments in the global South to sort of fall in line behind the United
23:39
States and the West behind rallying for Ukraine is the sense in which the West
23:45
was saying oh we have to be concerned about human rights and sovereignty and so on and so forth and I think the rest
23:52
of the global South kind of stood up and said oh so now you care about those values that's awfully convenient so I
23:59
think it it kind of also reflected a desire to basically show the finger to
24:05
exactly um which uh I think is you know a legitimate expression because as you
24:11
say I think there's you know our hypocrisy doesn't have consequences for
24:16
the balance of power in the world it doesn't it's just something to to be annoyed about but you know when it's the
24:23
case in in the United States in the west I think it's the feeling that well you this actually does have consequences cuz
24:29
you can influence how conflicts unfold you can influence nation states and you
24:34
choose only to do so when it serves your interests not when it's in the interests of
24:40
humanity we're um verging dangerously close to anti-imperialism here
24:47
um um so as we're talking about South Africa's solidarity with Palestine and
24:53
the Palestinians and we're drawing some parallels between the experiences of Palestinians and the experience of South
24:59
Africans under apartheid that's that's a parallel that's drawn by South Africans and by Palestinians alike often and as
25:05
Palestinians take inspiration from the South African story Lydia I'm curious if
25:10
you can talk a little bit about what you're thinking over the last last few weeks about the messiness and challenges
25:17
of Liberation yeah I mean I think look you know there's like a special and complicated relationship between South
25:23
Africa Israel and Palestine but um one thing that a lot of South Africans have said to me about the limits of of
25:30
comparing the experiences of Palestinians to the experiences of of black South Africans is just the extent
25:36
to which there was a tremendous amount of mixing because black South Africans and colored South Africans and Indian
25:41
South Africans were necessary as labor for the the white regime and so in some
25:47
ways that created the possibilities of solidarity through trade unions and through other other places where people
25:52
came into contact with one another so um you know there are definitely limits to sort of the comparisons between them and
25:59
and what we can learn but you know I've actually been very influenced by the work of a thinker named uh Mahmud
26:04
mandani who wrote this great book in 2020 called neither settler nor native um he's a a political theorist who um
26:11
teaches at Columbia University and and has spent some time in South Africa and he had this kind of beautiful idea that
26:17
South Africa's transition was possible because of this extraordinary Act of like creativity and Imagination in which
26:25
the holders of what we're seen as these you know very very fixed identities you know settler and Native were able
26:32
somehow to let go of what felt like these really fixed and opposed identities and mutually surrender them
26:39
to a sense of shared survivorship of um of a kind of brutal Colonial project and
26:45
together to build something new that sounds so kind of Airy fairy Pie in the
26:50
Sky could never happen it's sort of hard to believe that it happened in South Africa in this moment it's almost
26:56
impossible to imagine it happening in in you know in Israel and Palestine but um
27:01
I do think that there are things about the story of how South Africa was able to get from there to hear that feel sort
27:07
of deeply deeply relevant um to what's unfolding you know it's it's it's such a
27:13
such an interesting time to be in South Africa precisely because I think maybe
27:19
one thing that is Up For Debate now is
27:25
whether survivorship is enough to sustain postconflict political
27:32
identity years after the conflict because I think you you're kind of seeing that come undone and almost a
27:39
return to those crude means of identifying people such as native and
27:47
settler just these questions of of Who authentically belongs in the poity
27:52
that's kind of coming up again and I think it's it's for me it's depressing to see because I do for all its
27:59
limitations do believe in South Africa's Liberation story I I do think there's
28:04
there was something incredibly powerful about creating or or reimagining political identity that was rooted in in
28:13
solidarity even if it was an imperfect solidarity even if it was something as simply as surviving the dehumanization
28:22
of being oppressed and surviving the dehumanization of being an oppressor and
28:27
kind of saying how can we imagine a country where both can coexist after
28:34
being reinvented and sort of reconciling but I think I think it's also normal for
28:39
a country to reach this point where it's questioning whether the settlement it
28:45
made at the end of a conflict was the right one to question whether or not the political identities it reinvented are
28:53
enduring enough and we don't need to panic when that happens I guess the
28:58
thing that I'm wondering is is be that as it may what is the thing that kind of
29:03
holds everything together once that Pandora's Box is opened because it feels
29:09
once the foundations of the post aparted nation state are being questioned then
29:15
the whole project in its entirety might be questioned and is there going back after that are we going to something new
29:22
what might that something you be I want to talk more about whether we
29:27
see of the political Trends in South Africa playing out similarly and echoing around the rest of the world but first
29:34
let's take a quick break we'll be right [Music]
29:55
back I want us to spend a little more time talking about the challenges of a
30:00
young democracy like South Africa and looking at what lessons South Africa can apply to the rest of the world at a time
30:07
when we're seeing a lot of democracies young and not so young being tested this
30:12
is a big election year for a lot of countries around the world including the United States Mexico India and South
30:19
Africa of course Lydia what have you been seeing that's unique to South Africa and what do you see as similar to
30:28
democracies yeah I mean I think the afrobarometer which does these these really great surveys on South Africa and
30:35
and other countries on the continent found that 62% of South Africans are not satisfied with how democracy Works in
30:41
South Africa and in 2011 again the year that I moved here uh that figure was 39%
30:46
so there's actually been a really significant jump in dissatisfaction with democracy and I think we're we're seeing
30:52
similar Trends to that globally and particularly in Africa and indeed in much of the of the kind of decolonized
30:58
world the other thing that I definitely am seeing here in South Africa is a real
31:03
return of a kind of revanchist identity politics you know there are parties that are expressing a kind of ethnic
31:10
nationalism that has been quite taboo I think in South Africa um since the 1994 transition um this of course is a
31:17
global Trend and there's no reason why you would think it would be happening any any differently here but you you know we see it playing out in in another
31:24
election that's happening like literally as we speak that's wrapping up right now in India where Hindu nationalism has
31:30
been a really really big Force at the same time I think you're seeing a lot of the similar trends of of economic
31:35
populism here in South Africa but it feels quite untethered from traditional class-based left politics right which
31:43
lets it link up quite easily to identity-based politics and the kind of politics of the belly in a way that that
31:49
I find um quite quite worrying well some people are are saying
31:54
going into this election that South Africa's democracy is is quote unquote decline for for some of the reasons Lydia just laid out how do you assess
32:01
that statement the idea of democratic decline in South Africa is it fair to look at it that way I suppose I'd ask
32:08
what is the criteria to measure Democratic decline you know is it
32:13
decreasing voting participation but I think I think there are other ways in which one could credibly say that South
32:20
Africa's democracies and decline but I think it's also been a story of political demobilization right and the
32:28
reasons for that are numerous um major factors one as living and material
32:34
conditions get worse I think it's just gets harder to motivate people to be
32:40
politically active and I think another is that I think a lot of South Africans
32:47
are sort of at the moment kind of politically untethered it you know one
32:53
thing part of part of why I think the the posts about exceptionalism was a chimra is that it
33:04
was I want I don't want to say easy because I think that might sound uh a bit kind of crude and offensive but it
33:11
was much more straight forward to kind of rally South Africans against Zade
33:17
because the Injustice was clear the kind of antagonistic forces were clear right
33:23
whereas I think the political questions that as we've been discussing today that uh ha South Africa now are much less
33:30
straightforward and I think South Africans are still feeling their way about how to discuss them to debate them
33:39
who to Rally behind so I think that you know democracy is in Decline on the one hand for all of the reasons that Lydia
33:46
had outlined um but I also think democracy perhaps is better much maybe more accurate to say that it's it's in
33:52
an interregional period where it's unclear whether genuinely it is in the Cline or it might have a Resurgence um
34:01
and maybe not even for the better right well we're talking about sort of time and uh I want to ask a question about
34:08
about the younger generation the the so-called bornfree generation the people who are born and came of age after
34:13
apartheid how strong do you think their commitment is to democracy do they do
34:20
they want democracy or are they looking for something else entirely a different
34:25
Model H uh it's a it's a complicated question to answer um I
34:32
think they are committed to expanding our conception of democracy I think the
34:39
younger generation does not believe that democracy means voting in an election
34:47
once every four years I think they want to believe that it should mean something
34:53
expansive and I think you look at I think the the best expression of this is
34:58
2015 2016 where the student protest rocked South African University campuses
35:05
uh students were making demands for free education for decolonized education for
35:11
the ending of Outsourcing of Campus workers to private companies issued by
35:16
hired by universities a whole range of Demands and at the moment it came and
35:22
went but I think its Legacy is quite clear in the sense that you saw Young sou Africans articulating this idea that
35:30
a a kind of frustration with the idea that like 1994 was a real turning point
35:35
because South Africans had quote unquote democracy and they said well democracy for who um certainly it doesn't feel
35:43
like democracy for me it doesn't feel like democracy for millions of black working-class South Africans so I think
35:50
South Africans young South Africans want to push our understanding of democracy
35:56
um how that will manifest I'm not sure well and I think that you know you can
36:02
turn the question around and ask the political system how are you being responsive to these demands that young
36:09
people are you know young people in this country are sending very very clear signals of
36:15
dissatisfaction and the systems of of political power I think need to figure
36:21
out how to be responsive to and and and welcoming of those questions and demands
36:27
right like because the way to harness that and the way to ensure the longevity and health of a democracy is to welcome
36:33
those energies into the Democratic process and allow them to to have a seat at the table and and that to me is the
36:40
great task that needs to happen now and I think it's really incumbent upon the political powers that be to make a case
36:47
to those young people that that they can come in and they can reshape the country's politics because that's how
36:53
you ensure the future of democracy you can't be looking at young people and asking them why don't care about democracy well make a space for them
