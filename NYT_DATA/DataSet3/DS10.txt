hey matter of opinion listeners it's
0:04
Michelle coddle we are taking some time
0:06
off this holiday weekend but we did not
0:08
want to leave you empty-handed so we
0:11
have something a little different today
0:13
it's a fantastic audio essay from my
0:15
colleague and fellow Michelle New York
0:18
Times columnist Michelle Goldberg
0:20
Michelle spent some time last month with
0:22
supporters of Robert F Kennedy Jr to try
0:25
and answer this question if RFK Jr is
0:29
going to spoil the election is he going
0:31
to spoil it for Biden or Trump here's
0:34
her
0:35
[Music]
0:39
piece I'm Michelle Goldberg I'm a
0:42
columnist for the New York Times opinion
0:46
section I recently went to a rally for
0:49
Robert F Kennedy Jr in Oakland
0:51
California we need to sit with each
0:53
other and listen to the feelings and not
0:56
walk away and not see each other as
0:59
enemies
1:01
but learn to love each other even
1:03
through that anger and vitrio we need to
1:06
start coming back to each other as
1:08
Americans
1:11
again it was at the Henry J Kaiser
1:14
Convention Center this huge Auditorium
1:17
that wasn't anywhere close to full
1:20
although there were hundreds of people
1:22
there people who had very eccentric
1:25
politics I witnessed one interesting
1:27
exchange outside where somebody was
1:31
collecting signatures to try to
1:32
reinstate California's three strikes
1:34
laws basically to make criminal
1:36
penalties stricter in California he went
1:38
up to these two white-haired men who
1:41
really blanched and they were like no
1:42
we're from the left we have no interest
1:45
in Law and Order crackdowns one of them
1:47
was wearing a button that said ask me
1:49
about
1:50
911 which I actually didn't because I
1:53
didn't have that much time
2:00
Kennedy it seems obvious is going to
2:02
play a spoiler role in this election but
2:04
it was very unclear to me who he was
2:06
going to be a spoiler for and in some
2:09
ways my favorite kind of stories are the
2:10
ones that you walk into really looking
2:13
for the answer to a question and kind of
2:16
not having much of a predetermined view
2:19
one way or the other what is the most
2:22
important issue for you in this election
2:24
the First Amendment the freedoms medical
2:27
Freedom you know the people that are Co
2:29
was really the deciding factor for a lot
2:31
of people the co lockdowns were
2:34
something that was really important to
2:36
me that I I felt was unconstitutional
2:38
you know you shut down all these small
2:41
businesses and people are not recovering
2:43
from that you know talk about a number
2:45
of people I spoke to had never been to
2:47
political rallies before one of them was
2:50
Chris inclan a drug and alcohol
2:52
counselor who had this sort of
2:54
ideologically erratic voting history so
2:58
it's funny so I voted for Jill B Stein
3:01
2016 and then in the primaries Andrew
3:04
Yang I felt like Biden was so ingrained
3:07
in the establishment and Politics as
3:09
Usual so I ended up voting for Trump but
3:12
he didn't really like Trump either I
3:14
mean he basically felt like it was
3:16
unfair and in this I think he speaks for
3:18
a lot of Americans that he just didn't
3:20
want to have to make this decision again
3:23
what's your name jacn Fisher were you a
3:26
democrat in the past or were you
3:27
Independence no I had been Republican
3:30
but became
3:31
independent gosh several elections ago I
3:34
lean more towards libertarian are you
3:36
somebody who was attracted like the
3:38
medical
3:39
Freedom yes especially during Co um it
3:44
very hard um we couldn't go to church
3:46
all of these restrictions I want to make
3:48
sure that doesn't happen again so that's
3:50
very important to me medical Freedom
3:52
religious freedom if Kennedy wasn't on
3:55
the ballot who would you be voting for
3:57
you know what that's so hard the lesser
3:59
of evils but honestly probably
4:03
Trump Matt Castro is a bus driver in San
4:07
Francisco I I was so disillusioned after
4:11
2020 with the mandates so I took a lot
4:13
of vaccines the third one hit me quite
4:15
hard I just kind of went along with the
4:17
her big mistake right he said that if
4:20
RFK isn't on the ballot he's going to
4:21
vote for Donald Trump I just think that
4:24
the vaccines ultimately they lied to us
4:26
they suppressed the truth about what was
4:29
actually you know they were given to the
4:31
population there's an overlap between
4:33
New Age Wellness culture and the far
4:35
right that goes way way
4:38
back and I think in terms of
4:41
libertarianism there's a sense of
4:44
nobody's going to tell me what to do
4:46
there's a fundamental distrust of
4:48
experts there's a weakness for
4:51
quackery people associate crunchy New
4:54
Age culture with the left and there's
4:58
obviously something to that Association
5:01
my guess is that most of the people at
5:02
my yoga studio are voting for Democrats
5:05
but there's also this real strain on the
5:09
right and it's gotten more intense since
5:12
the pandemic there were definitely
5:14
people at the rally who voted for Biden
5:16
in 2020 but they were mostly people who
5:19
had already decided to definitely not
5:22
vote for him again I don't think anybody
5:25
knows the precise nature of the spoiler
5:28
role that Kennedy is going to play
5:31
there's both a lot of pundits who think
5:33
that RFK Jr is primarily a threat to
5:35
Biden but there's also political
5:37
insiders both Republican and Democrat
5:40
who see it that way I think we know from
5:43
Kennedy's own remarks from things that
5:45
he said recently on CNN that he
5:47
considers Biden a bigger threat to
5:50
democracy than Trump so he seems like he
5:53
would be happy to spoil the election in
5:56
Trump's Direction but the other side of
5:59
that that is that he's going to attract
6:01
people presumably who see things the
6:03
same way and those are people who would
6:06
lean Trump if he weren't in the
6:13
race RFK Jr is assembling this Coalition
6:18
of the distrustful this Coalition of the
6:22
alienated and there's a lot of overlaps
6:26
between that Coalition and Donald Trump
6:29
Coalition it's not precisely the same
6:31
thing but there's a lot of room in the
6:33
VIN diagram where the two intersect I
6:36
think most people think I'm different
6:38
and weird for questioning I think most
6:41
people just want you to be quiet and
6:44
Trust the government I'd like to see
6:46
them really taking on these
6:49
pharmaceutical companies and the the
6:51
companies that are poisoning the water
6:52
and all of that so that we could have
6:55
really a good generation of children I
6:57
think it was I would say that his rally
6:58
surprised me because it was a much more
7:03
conservative or heterodox libertarian
7:06
leaning crowd than I had anticipated I'm
7:10
more scared of the multilateral
7:12
organizations the WTO the United Nations
7:15
the world economic Forum because they
7:17
have the money and the power and they
7:20
influence and pay off all the
7:21
politicians of all the states in the
7:23
world all never and It's Tricky when you
7:28
report on things like this because on
7:29
the one hand it's true that anecdote and
7:32
data are not the same thing you can't
7:35
extrapolate from the people who go to a
7:37
rally about what the electorate at large
7:39
is going to do because people who go to
7:41
political rallies are a very kind of
7:45
distinct breed right most people just
7:46
aren't that into any
7:48
politicians but I also remember back in
7:52
2016 when I would go to Trump rallies
7:55
and I would have this sinking feeling
7:59
this doesn't feel on the ground the way
8:02
conventional wisdom says this election
8:05
is is going to shake out and saying but
8:07
this is what the polls say having gone
8:09
through that I think that we can at
8:11
least take something away from the
8:15
texture of these actual events and the
8:18
stories of these actual
