Why Do We Hate Kamala Harris? Do We?

I don't know what a what a Latin Mass baptism is like I've never I've been to one it's it's just gotten more exorcisms
0:07
like more anti- Satan material haven't we all been to one and it is called the
0:12
godfa that ended well The Godfather should not be our source especially not that
0:18
scene from New York Times opinion I'm Ross D I'm Michelle coddle I'm Carlos

Bidens polling struggles
0:36
and the news this week is that Joe Biden is still losing the 2024 presidential election there's a new time Sienna poll
0:43
out this week showing Trump still leading in five Battleground States and
0:48
notably Biden's numbers are worse in Nevada Georgia and Arizona while Trump
0:54
is still winning a surprisingly large share of younger African-American and
1:00
Hispanic voters notably these are precisely the
1:05
demographics that Joe Biden was hoping to sh up around this time four years ago
1:10
when he selected California Senator kamla Harris as his running mate last week we talked about Trump's VP short
1:17
list so this week we want to talk first about Biden's polling struggles but then also whether vice president Harris is
1:24
part of the problem or if she could be part of the solution but let's start with the polls was anybody surprised by
1:32
the time Sienna results I don't think it was very different right I mean it's not like there was a huge shift yeah it
1:38
doesn't seem like there's been a tremendous amount of movement I think one thing that just seems really striking is despite all of the
1:45
discussion about the role that the war in Gaza and all of the campus activism
1:50
and pro Palestine activism the uncommitted movement all of that seemed to be something that could pose a
1:56
significant threat to Biden I don't know that we're see in this poll a ton of evidence to support that this is really
2:03
costing him which is actually not that surprising foreign policy is almost never a top issue the one thing that was
2:09
also really striking is that the place where Biden is doing best is Michigan which is I believe the state with the
2:15
largest proportion of arab-american Voters and was really kind of an epicenter of the uncommitted movement so
2:22
that's something that really struck me this is great this is you know Sunny Side Up silver lighting territory for
2:28
for Joe Biden could be so much worse there's a campaign slogan yes okay um I'll go a little Sunnyside down please
2:35
eore let's go eore I don't know what the opposite of Sunny Side Up is over over medium for Joe Biden we're going to
2:41
Stage the butter battle book I mean I I think I think this has always felt like it was going to be a very close election
2:48
and I'm sure it still will be so anything that shows a consistent
2:53
direction or preference is interesting to me not to get to horse racy because that's bad God forbid but with the
2:59
caveat that it's very early you know this it's not it's not very early it's May the elections in November I want to
3:05
deny that caveat it's May the elections in November it is early but um Trump isn't just leading in five out of the
3:10
six swing States he's leading by quite a bit by at least seven percentage points in four of those States these aren't
3:16
like margin of error leads right and it's happening at a moment when Trump is basically having to campaign outside
3:22
courtrooms with occasional rallies thrown in so we can say not much to see
3:27
here it sort of feels like the same but it feels the same in the that it it looks good for Donald Trump well the
Biden team should be nervous
3:33
thing that I think the Biden team should be super nervous about that you're seeing in these polls is the consistent
3:39
sense that stuff needs to change a change election is bad for the incumbent
3:45
this is not about a particular policy this is not about a particular Scandal this is just a general sense that there
3:53
needs to be some significant shift and Trump obviously is the guy who's more
4:00
likely to blow stuff up and I think what's striking though is that it's changed at the top of the ticket because the numbers for the Senate seats that
4:07
are included in the poll actually look not amazing but pretty good for the Democrats who are trying to win seats
4:14
there's a lot of evidence in here that there are democratic voters who are quite happy to stick with the party but
4:21
for the top of the ticket are open to kind of going nuclear and that to me is pretty fascinating well the other thing
4:28
that I find which is kind of intriguing is people talk about how Trump has changed all the rules he's blown up all
4:34
the knowes about politics but with this Dynamic I actually see a couple of
4:40
political fundamentals that are holding they're just combining in a weird way one is you tend to have buyer remorse
4:48
with presidents you see this in the midterm election where the outof power party tends to do better and you combine
4:55
that with the Nostalgia that people often get for the pred administrations
5:00
you know it's that kind of you've survived the past and you look back on it and it's a little fuzzy and it's not
5:07
as scary as it seemed at the time so you have Nostalgia for old administrations
5:12
and buyers remorse for new ones it's just that usually those old administrations aren't on the ticket
We dont ride the polar coaster
5:18
well so this raises the question like to what extent is the Biden team actually
5:24
worried by these kind of numbers and there's sort of a lively on line debate
5:30
about just that question you have people saying well obviously the Biden team is
5:35
you know a bunch of political professionals they understand the situation you know they're working to turn it around but then you also have
5:41
for instance a piece in axios just the other day quoting insiders saying you
5:47
know Biden and his advisers just don't really believe the poll right and think that they're going to be on track to win
5:53
their phrase is we don't ride the polar coaster which is adorable and yet did they really say that oh yes they really
5:59
you know someone thought of that and thought like that's gold I'm going to use that grown at the same time though if you
6:05
talk to people um working with the campaign or on the campaign or whatever they are
6:11
excruciatingly aware of needing to reach out and fire up certain demographics
6:18
that tend to be among their base you know like they are very concerned about how to reach young black men how to get
6:25
the point across that this is an important election things like that they will will talk to you about what needs
6:32
to be done even as they'll dismiss polls well let okay so let's talk about
The multiracial future
6:38
those demographics with which the Biden campaign is down because the idea that Biden has a problem winning or exciting
6:47
young black men for instance the idea that Hispanic voters in Arizona and
6:53
Nevada are turning to Trump because that connects obviously to the woman with
6:58
whom Joe Biden is running Biden chose kamla Harris as a running mate in 2020
7:04
as a very explicit representation of the democratic party's multi-racial future
7:10
right that was sort of the core idea obviously it sort of went beyond that and there was a sense around the George
7:16
Floyd protest that Biden absolutely had to pick an African-American running mate
7:21
he'd sort of narrowed his choices to a group of African-American women but but more broadly there was an idea that the
7:28
vice presidential candidate was the candidate of the multi-racial future so was that theory right at the time how is
7:35
that theory working out would anyone argue it is working it's it's hard to argue that it's working and I think one
7:41
of the reasons that it is not working is that I don't think that identity Works in quite the way that that they seem to
7:48
be attempting to make it work in this case it's actually quite a complex thing the notion of identifying with someone
7:55
because they share a background with you we're all individuals and you know we all have different experiences there are
8:01
lots of different kinds of black people in America there are lots of different kind of Hispanic people in America these are not monolithic identities and I was
8:07
struck listening to the interview that our colleague in The Newsroom is sted hearnen did with kamla Harris by
8:13
actually like how unusual and sort of biracial and bicultural kamla Harris's identity is and whether that might
8:20
actually be a place where it has been quite difficult for it to translate and you think about the one black president
8:25
that we've had was also biracial but he was married to a black American woman who was clearly instrumental in building
8:33
a bridge between his very unusual life story and upbringing and the sort of
8:39
core black American experience and so I think this identity stuff is actually incredibly complex and very very tricky
8:47
and the assumption that having someone who represents a quote unquote multi-racial and and she is quite
8:52
literally multi-racial she is multi-racial it's just not going to automatically resonate with someone
8:58
who's like oh yeah this person looks like me because the truth is she doesn't look like anybody except yourself there have been lots of awkward pairings on
Awkward pairings
9:04
presidential tickets right like McCain Palin was a it was a very painful pairing to watch they were two Mavericks
9:11
were they two Outsider what do you mean awkward it was chemistry oh yeah yeah
9:16
you can you can tell in all the Memoirs after the fact that they they just they just loved each other but this um cazy
9:23
the Biden Harris ticket never really felt a particularly natural pairing it
9:28
was very much the product of a moment if it's not summer 2020 I just I really don't think Harris is on the ticket I
9:34
remember Amy kachar who wanted to be on the ticket saying look it can't be me it's got to be a woman of color Jill
9:40
Biden didn't even like her saying like why are we going to pick the one person who's like been been mean to critical of
9:46
you know who's attacked Joe like everyone remembers that that great moment depending on your point of view just for me it's great because it was so
9:51
awkward that um that that that moment a lot about you Carlos oh I I love witnessing other people's awkwardness
9:58
like in my presence it's it's the um the um but no when she says you know listen Joe I don't think you're a
10:04
racist which is a great way to get other people to think that he might be a racist right um so it was just a very
10:11
strange connection to question if it's been successful it you know depends on how you define success in a very poorly
10:17
defined job if the idea is that she was going to sustain and broaden this quote
10:23
multiracial Coalition you know that that the Coalition of the ascendant carrying the party into the future that doesn't
10:28
necessarily seem to have been the case these polls suggest that if success was appeasing the kind of activist base that
10:33
was so mobilized in that moment I don't think that's necessarily worked either she's not a natural activist well she
Kamalas presidential campaign
10:39
was a former prosecutor and that was part of the question when she had her own presidential campaign was you know
10:46
the kind of lackluster reception she was receiving among some of the activist base in the Democratic party yeah I mean
10:53
look she ran for president and it didn't go well that's the bottom line that's charitable very yeah I mean I think it
11:00
didn't go well and you know if I recall correctly I think she dropped out rather than faced losing her own state but I
11:06
think she was quite successful as a state level politician in California she
11:12
was very effective as a prosecutorial presence in the Senate she had a number
11:17
of these kind of you know viral moments and she's exhibited real Charisma and sharpness it utterly failed to translate
11:24
onto the presidential stage and I am not sure what the Biden team saw that they
11:30
thought would overcome all of those things and make her effective as a vice
11:35
president well let's talk about the way they've they've used her it is of course
How Biden has used Kamala
11:41
a predictable feature of American politics that the vice president gets either meaningless portfolios or totally
11:48
thankless portfolios so like she was handed the job of you know going to
11:53
Central America and figuring out figuring out the immigration Crisis crisis that was just Biden's Vengeance
12:00
because Obama handed him the same job it's hazing it's Vice presidental hazing that's just like you know well I was I
12:07
mean I have sort of a question related to that but the the first question is that sort of since then there's been a
12:13
shift towards I would say basically using her as a Tribune for socially
12:20
liberal causes pro-choice politics above all she's on a you know fight for
12:26
reproductives freedoms tour which is also a customary way of using a vice
12:31
president to sort of do Shoring up the Bas kind of work I mean do you guys think that has worked well do you think
12:39
of her as a effective Tribune for elevating and highlighting the
12:44
pro-choice Cause part of it is because Biden's not necessarily a natural voice
Is Kamala an effective surrogate
12:49
himself on those issues so you know whether she's been effective in elevating the cause she's been effective
12:55
in like taking that off Biden's plate doing things that he's not necessarily unnatural for I think she's definitely
13:02
useful for Joe Biden to not have to be kind of like awkwardly discussing abortion yeah and I think that she's
13:08
actually a really effective messenger for this issue I mean she is a woman who's had a really big career embodies
13:16
the sort of Modern Woman of of Our Generation right who's been in charge
13:21
been in control of her life and I think her life experiences speak a lot to the
13:26
type of women you know Suburban female voters who you want to really rally and
13:32
keep on sides on this issue the question that I have is I don't know that those voters were actually at risk right and
13:39
the places where there is greater vulnerability for example with young men of color I actually don't know that she
13:46
is a particularly effective surrogate and I don't know that the messages that she's out there with are going to draw
13:51
them back in in fact I I shouldn't say I don't know I feel quite certain that they won't I just want to push on the issue question right here because
13:59
Matt glacius a frequent commentator on intad Democratic debates has repeatedly
14:06
made the argument that the Persona that Harris had in California this sort of
14:12
prosecutorial figure which was a Persona that she extended in certain ways in the Senate but then had to run away from as
14:20
a presidential candidate because she could be attacked from the left on criminal justice issues Gus's argument
14:27
is that that Persona is what the Democratic ticket needs instead
14:33
of a vice president who's out there sort of Shoring up the base whether it's on abortion rights or voting rights or
14:40
anything like this you want kamla the cop who's saying we're going to be tough on the border we're going to be tough on
14:46
crime you can trust us Centrist moderate voters and I as a former prosecutor can
14:54
be that sort of tough-minded democrat because that clearly has not been a mode
15:00
that they've really even tried to operate in there are ways in which she brings that sort of prosecutorial Zeal
15:06
to the discussions of abortion for instance she's not out there sort of saying like as a woman X Y or Z you know
15:13
she's kind of like taken it to Trump pointing him out as the guilty party here she's picked a specific way to talk
15:19
about abortion that can in some ways be her own but this whole conversation
15:25
about Harris is pivoting back forth between who she really might be and who
15:32
the administration needs her to be and that uncertainty that haziness about
15:38
someone's like true posture and true positions I think becomes evident in just the way someone like Harris moves
15:45
in the world of politics you know she's awkward in speeches you know she's awkward taking reporters questions she's
15:51
prickly it it feels kind of unnatural right and I remember in her Memoir she talked about that tension the way she
15:58
resolved it she was never like hardcore activist based she was an institutionalist right she said you know
16:03
when activists come banging on the door I want to be inside listening to them and helping
16:10
open those doors she's kind of in between she's not like the full-on wonk she's not the full-on activist and when
16:17
she you know fully tries to embrace one of those personas it doesn't feel quite real I I think that's also reflects
Party of the Multiracial Future
16:23
there's just a confusion in the Democratic party about what it means to
16:30
be the party of the multi-racial future does that mean the multi-racial future
16:35
as defined by you know to cite that quote the activist groups that tend to
16:41
say we are speaking for Hispanics African-Americans recent immigrants women and so on or does it mean
16:48
recognizing that often times The Wider population of those groups don't have
16:53
views that align with the activists and so maybe to be multi-racial you have to
16:59
be more the Centrist I think she's sort of walking along that tension in the
17:04
Democratic party's own self-standing well we do have the generational split that you see in for instance the time
17:10
Sienna poll where it's not just that younger black voters have a problem with
17:16
Biden it's that all younger voters have a problem with Biden it's just more Stark when you're talking about a
17:23
demographic group that was traditionally so overwhelmingly Democratic but Harris
17:29
much like Biden isn't the kind of figure geared to excite younger voters who you
17:34
know they want to see some real change feisty blow it up revolution in many
17:41
cases um which is not what say older black voters want to see they tend to be
17:47
vastly more moderate or conservative than the activist base of the democratic party so yes the generational split is
17:54
where I think this ticket has a real problem well and and it represents these sort of two passing Generations I
18:01
personally believe that we'll never have a Gen X president I'm just quite certain that it's going to pass us over it should only be appropriate we're just
18:08
grateful to be here yeah I feel like just a tremendous amount of identification with kamla Harris and
18:14
maybe this is a little overdetermined just because like me she's a biracial Multicultural uh Gen X woman who who's
18:20
also black and uh you know in my own sort of small way I I see a lot of her struggles and see them as my own and you
18:27
look at the generation of quote unquote multi-racial political talents who are coming up behind and the
18:34
amount of Freedom the amount of of looseness and and also like excitement
18:39
that they're able to generate because they're not operating within the same binary sets of rules that I feel that my
18:45
generation of black women operated within I I mean I look at and obviously she's a just a very unique generational
18:52
talent but I look at somebody like Alexandria Okio Cortez and the just level of excitement that she has been
18:58
able to generate as a woman as a person of color as a progressive Democrat who
19:04
has also I think shifted pretty considerably in in how she operates within the inside of the democratic
19:10
party it's just like impossible for me to imagine kamla Harris playing any sort
19:15
of politics successfully that looks anything like what Alexandria kazio Cortez does I'm not saying that that's
19:21
what Biden needs in order to win but I think that like if you're looking for excitement if you're looking for
19:27
something that feels like a forward-looking vision of the future for the Democratic party like that doesn't feel like a register that K haris can
19:34
naturally inhabit all right well we're going to take a break and when we come back I
The Dan Quail Factor
19:39
just want to focus in on the aspect of Harris's unpopularity that doesn't seem
19:47
perfectly captured by any kind of analysis of her positioning the Dan Quail Factor let's call it in her
19:55
difficulties so we'll be on that theme when we come back [Music]
20:14
[Music] so let's talk about the central problem
20:21
of the Harris vice presidency which is not her policy stance it's not necessarily how the Biden Administration
20:27
has used her but just the idea that has taken hold of her sort of let's say
20:35
absurdity as a political figure and I'm going to use a a listener's comment to
20:40
start us off on this conversation this is Moren from Colorado who wrote into to us and said hi team love the show thank
20:47
you Moren we love you too Moren Moren we love you we love you she says I'm a good liberal in quotes and I feel like I've
20:54
drank the camela Harris equals not good Kool-Aid why why do we hate kamla Harris
Why Do We Hate Kamala
21:00
am I racist sexist I sure don't think so but even the Liberals and intellectuals
21:06
and the chattering class all seem to have dismissed her so what do you guys
21:11
think why do we hate kamla Harris because there is something more here than just another vice president
21:17
struggling with their positioning I just want to say for the record I I do not hate Kam haris I don't think any of us hate you ident you identif why do we
21:25
hate why do we hate Lydia pgre I think question if you hate kamla then you hate me we hate you I'm sorry so look I have
21:32
done a lot of digging over the years into the whole question of unconscious
21:39
bias with women in executive political leadership or you know even executive
21:45
business leadership and it becomes incredibly hard to parse but there is definitely something there there's a
21:53
much narrower Lane for women leaders of
21:58
what is acceptable than there is for men who kind of look straight out of Central Casting as a certain former president
22:05
likes to say but you saw it with Hillary Clinton to a certain degree and what you
22:10
hear a lot of times is like oh I don't have a problem with women leaders I just have a problem with this woman leader
22:17
and it kind of comes through in things like both Hillary and kamla got smacked
22:23
for their laugh the cackle the word cackle is just kind of a red flag on a
22:30
lot of these things so this is not to say that it is entirely sexism I am not
22:36
going there but I am saying that it does become really hard to tell where that
22:41
line is between I don't quite like the way she laughs or the way she talks or the way
22:47
she jokes or the whatever and something specific to her or her gender actually I
22:54
I find it so interesting that in her question itself Meen from Colorado anticipates exactly what you are saying
23:01
right I'm a good liberal and as a good liberal she asks am I racist am I sexist no she's not being racist or sexist yeah
23:07
well that'll be reassuring to Morin I don't think that being disappointed by a politician necessarily means that you
23:13
hate whatever identity marker you find most Salient in that politician um I know you guys mock me for ringing up
23:19
books but Hillary's what happened book does a really good job picking apart how all those factors affected her campaign
23:25
in 2016 you know more than one thing can be true at the same time I think it's unambiguously clear that kamla Harris is
23:31
not terrific in the settings in which most people draw their conclusions about politicians you get the the classic
23:37
thing you hear about men and women who are not good in public we're like they're better in small groups oh that was Al Gore better on group podcast
23:44
better small groups always you know like that is that is gender neutral damning with faint praise then he should be a
23:50
school board member yeah yeah well you know it's interesting because I think again this like legibility question is
23:55
really important and this doesn't really matter for like the average voter because they're not you know huge consumers of social media or of memes as
24:02
we are but like kamla as meme maker and not in a good way is like a real
24:07
phenomenon and there's one that really stood out to me in a set of remarks you know about the coconut tree thing have
24:13
you guys have you guys heard about this you're going to have to refresh I'm the extremely online person right you are so
24:19
online well there have been a number of number of memes you know she's like clapping along to the people in Puerto
24:24
Rico who are protesting against her um not realizing that that's what going on that was one of them which was like
24:30
straight out of EP but the coconut tree one was really striking to me because again it comes back to the her the way
24:35
that her identities don't neatly map on to our expectations here in the United States and I'm just going to read what
24:41
she said in that speech she says my mother used to say um she would give us a hard time sometimes and she would say
24:47
to us I don't know what's wrong with you young people you think you just fell out of a coconut tree you exist in the
24:54
context of all in which you live and what came before you now kamla Harris's
24:59
mother is originally from India right um I I lived in India for 3 years and to me
25:05
I heard that and I was like oh that is like an Indian Auntie kind of thing to say like I it was totally legible to me
25:12
I think to a lot of Americans here's this woman who you think of as a black woman you're like wait why are you talking about coconut trees this is like
25:18
a Zen Coan like I think it's just like not good politics right to like you know use a phrase that is just like not going
25:26
to be legible to your audience but I really do think there's something about
25:31
her her sort of mixed cultural heritage her set of references that just makes it
25:37
very hard to translate so I don't know I think like again I feel this deep sense
25:43
of identification and understanding where she comes from while also recognizing that these things alienate people I want to I already dropped the
Dan Quail
25:50
you know the Dan Quail analogy but I want to go back to it because I I think that is actually what we're talking
25:56
about here and I of course ident ify with Dan Quail right as a um very
26:03
handsome and intelligent white male any with a great head of hair who
26:08
any politician seeking sort of youthful energy would want on their ticket and
26:14
joking aside that is when George HW Bush picked Dan Quail he thought he was
26:20
picking a young Jack kennedy-esque handsome future of the Republican Party
26:28
kind of figure giving his ticket a big infusion of Youth it was not the same dynamic as Biden picking Harris but it
26:35
was not completely different right and then in practice Quail became a meme the
26:42
potato misspelling is the most famous incident but you know who Among Us has not in some context had a commonplace
26:50
word that you know might misspell to this day I freak out when I have to spell potato I mean it's you know there
26:56
there are reasons that there are common misspellings right right let's speak up for Dan Quail Dan Quail was not as
27:01
stupid and ridiculous a figure by any means as the meme of Dan Quail became
27:07
but it didn't matter because he had something intangible in his Essence that
27:13
just sounds like Precious bod fluids but I think I think this is true
27:19
I don't think I don't think you can distill in a perfect way why Dan Quail
27:25
became Dan Quail or why kamla Harris has become Harris without talking about some
27:30
indefinable aspect of political Charisma that when it doesn't work it just really
27:35
doesn't work oh totally true you think you're getting a symbol but you're actually just getting a person a person
27:41
who may be more politically talented or less politically talented than others and you know it's a little on Biden in
27:49
the sense that like so Obama needed Biden in ways that were both substantive
27:54
and symbolic Obama was sort of yeah he was a Senator but kind of a a fight in the Senate to Washington Biden had all
28:00
the old relationships he knew everyone that's the substance um symbolically he needed him to kind of like reassure
28:06
people who are like who the hell is this Barack Obama guy you know and like Biden is like part of the Washington Furniture
28:11
he's been there forever but Biden I don't think has ever felt that he needs kamla Harris in a substantive way the
28:19
weight she's had to shoulder this whole time has been symbolic well I think it's
28:24
also striking in the Obama Biden example that that Obama was a black man needing
28:30
a white man to vouch for him and the dynamic is just different when you've
28:35
got you know like this black person is going to sort of cover a flank for me and also this person is a woman and it
28:41
the Dynamics of it just feel like completely different than they did because ultimately the more powerful
28:46
position is the presidency and um it would have been on Biden I think to kind of like level that playing field
28:52
somewhat and I think he did not do that he tried in some ways but it didn't last and it didn't really work like Obama
28:59
would often say my vice president which really irked Joe Biden and Biden is careful to say you know the vice
29:05
president right saying like this is an important office in its own right but you know they were supposed to have weekly meetings you know Biden and
29:13
Harris and that that the line for did the president call right and those those meetings kind of fell off the schedule
29:18
one of the shortest chapters in Frank for's book about the Biden presidency is about kamla Harris right there're just there there there wasn't a lot
29:26
there it's like the sad sentence you could utter say the shortest one of one of the
29:32
one of the shorter one of the shortest okay still it's sad all right so let's end on a constructive note there's some
Success
29:39
time before the election if you're KLA Harris if you're Joe Biden if you're the Biden campaign what does success look
29:47
like is there some model that could work wait for comma for comma they do need to send her out whipping up voters on
29:54
Reproductive Rights I think that that is actually a very good use of for time especially because he's so awkward on it
29:59
and it is a hugely mobilizing issue for not just Democrats but you know soft
30:07
Republicans independent swing voters so you know that seems like a perfectly good use of her skills in this case I
30:14
remember our colleague Ezra kleene had a um a much discussed uh sort of audio essay a few months ago where he
30:20
suggested that Biden might be sort of equipped to govern for a second term but isn't necessarily equipped to campaign
30:26
for a second term and I'm wondering in sort of the best case scenario for the Democrats if it
30:33
might be the other way around for kamla Harris she might be better at campaigning for the second term than she
30:40
actually has been in carving out a distinctive governance role I think the
30:46
abortion rights message as you said Ross that's something on which you know she's not going to create a whole lot of new
30:51
voters but it is it is mobilizing it helps with fundraising and I find it interesting that her message now to
30:58
Black voters isn't racial Justice and voting rights and policing it's Economic Opportunity right it's much more brass
31:05
tax this Economic Opportunity tour that she's doing it's far more specific than
31:10
the mor amorphous activist message I think she's more comfortable in that kind of role than in the other yeah I I
31:17
would say that if there were one place where she could bring her prosecutorial like I'm a tough person Persona back it
31:24
actually might be in speaking to voters about immigration because I think there actually is a hunger for a more sort of
31:31
like realistic policy message um and the fact that she has a track record of
31:36
having said some pretty tough things might actually play to her strengths and get her out of this like weird
31:42
identitarian role that I think she actually is not very well equipped to play so these are places where she has
31:48
been strong in the past but her strength hasn't necessarily been matched correctly with opportunity and this
31:54
might be surprisingly a place where you can point the finger at Republicans and be like look there are lots of ways that we've tried to toughen things up or make
32:00
changes or or do these things I went to Latin America I told people you know do not try to come you will not be allowed
32:05
in and I think that that's actually a message that could play well with non-white voters I would only add to
The VP Debate
32:12
that that the biggest stage that she will have this fall will be the vice presidential debate there will be
32:18
actually an opportunity for Harris to do maybe a version of what you just describe Lydia sort of trying to turn
32:24
the tables on Republicans or maybe just trying to set up a contrast with whomever Trump has picked on the
32:30
assumption that some Americans will be casting a vote fearing that in voting for Biden they're voting for someone who
32:37
could die in office and it will make a difference how Paris appears I'm glad you raised the VP debate because in
32:43
preparation for our conversation today last night I rewatched the scintillating Harris Pence debate from uh Utah in 2020
32:51
what was wrong with you and it was really interesting and like I don't think this election is going to be decided on the strength of the the veps
32:58
I think it's ultimately going to be decided by the the top of the ticket that said she was pretty good on that debate stage you know she had a real
33:05
Mastery of of of details and issues she was very smart about how she referred to people like Biden was always Joe you
33:11
know like Joe and I this and Joe and I that whereas Pence is always Michael Pence the vice president you know very
33:16
formal and therefore unrelatable so to the extent that the veps matter I think she can perhaps be better at campaigning
33:24
than governing and to the extent that the debate matters I think she showed herself to do really well the last time around but this time she'll be up
33:30
against the raw Charisma of Doug beram and she won't have a
33:36
chance all right we're going to leave it there and when we come back one of us will get hot and cold
33:48
[Music]
Jerry Seinfeld
34:01
all right guys who has our hot or cold this week I am hot this week um you
34:10
are Carlos so hot right now yeah so um listeners of the show may have developed
34:17
the erroneous assumption that my primary obsessions are reading books by Jimmy
34:22
Carter or something like that but if you ask erroneous fully erroneous erous if you ask my children they would tell you
34:28
that my true Obsession and my my primary cultural Touchstone is the 1990s TV sitcom Seinfeld I have watched every
34:36
show uh multiple times I own the DVD set DV Google what DVD is kids and I inflict
34:42
scenes from Seinfeld onto my kids multiple times a week they like it a year ago I actually I at least they tell
34:49
me they like it they love it Jerry I reviewed a book A book about the show called seinfeldia and I included a
34:55
Seinfeld reference either wellknown or very obscure in every sentence of the review it's still my masterpiece um God
35:02
spoke through my pen that's another Seinfeld reference so all that to say is that I was kind of worried when I
35:08
learned that Jerry sefel was going to deliver the commencement address at Duke this year commencement addresses are a
35:14
very stilted and sort of confining form but I watched it and I liked it it
35:20
wasn't super funny um it had some good moments but it's being shared on social media and the like mainly for him
35:25
pleading with the graduates to not lose their sense of humor right even if it's at the cost of occasional hard feelings
35:32
it's okay you got to laugh that is the one thing part I didn't care but he said something else that the more I think
35:38
about it the more hot on it I am he said everyone tells you to follow your passions I say the hell with passion
35:45
find Fascination Fascination is way better than passion that may seem like a
35:50
fake distinction but I think it's a smart distinction I think passion can be
35:55
very fleeting passions can ultimately disappoint you passions are often set
36:01
against reason and Justice as uh Alexander Hamilton said in federal 15 but they can also leave you empty when
36:07
they are unfulfilled as they often are Fascination lasts longer because Fascination is about learning it's about
36:14
deepening knowledge rather than just declaring it it's about process in its Essence more than about outcome and life
36:21
is about process more than about outcome it takes longer to write a book than to read it it takes longer to record this
36:26
podcast than it does to actually listen to it so I think that's a great thing for young college graduates to hear
36:33
especially when they've always been told to follow their passions so I'm hot on
36:38
Fascination over passion on process over outcome and on Jerry Seinfeld's commencement address at Duke University
36:45
which I encourage you to watch I'm going to check it out it sounds great I have also given a commencement address and
Commencement Addresses
36:51
it's one of the most nerve-wracking things I can imagine I like I it's so
36:56
terrifying but I think most kids don't really remember them I I can't remember who spoke at most kids are drunk during the commencement where did you where did
37:03
you give the commencement address at the uh cuni journalism school which was great great school I love it very
37:08
sensibly No One lets me near students or give commencement speeches I I have
37:14
given the commencement address at my at my high school that is the only Commencement Address I've I've ever
37:20
given and I think I killed it I did I thought I I don't think you should be the judge of
37:26
that w ask the students Ross is there video uh I don't it was it was it was some it was
37:33
some years ago um and it was before the internet it was in 1933 Carlos so crazy
37:40
time nobody it was nobody knows what was said um I don't remember who who spoke my year of graduation from college but
37:47
the year before me the year that my wife graduated William F Buckley was the speaker o fancy yeah yes that was back
37:54
when they let conservatives give Comm oh wait I doubt it conservatives give better commencement
37:59
addresses than liberals I I I wrote a piece comparing collections of commencement addresses and I found that
38:04
conservatives were are you kidding me you wrote you WR that's of course you did Ross who are you talking I am hot on
