The ‘Empty Suit’ of Trump’s Masculinity



0:00
yall go forth to do the Lord's work you know you all a Southerners I am from the Deep South that's right South America
0:07
Lima Peru okay so like don't don't you all try to like out Southern me Carlos is so South he comes out the other side
0:14
I was born in South Alabama and I'm still a Yankee to you it's
0:20
true from New York Times opinion I'm Michelle coddle I'm Carlos Lozada and
0:25
this is matter of opinion
0:34
so our co-host Ross and Lydia are both out this week but I invited A League of
0:40
Extraordinary Gentlemen to join us Carlos to dig into what is going on with
0:46
men in this election because a big question emerging from 2024 is what a
0:52
men want why does Biden seem to be losing them and why does Trump seem to appeal to so many of them to help tease
0:58
this out we are joined to today by two friends of the show opinion columnist Jamal buoy and David French Jamal
1:04
welcome back oh hello thank you for having me and David it's always a pleasure welcome guys well thanks for
1:10
having me I mean I heard there might be possible discussion of professional wrestling and so nothing can keep me
1:17
away from that conversation okay so it's not exactly wrestling but we are going to have to start with UFC that's because
1:25
Trump's first public outing last weekend as a convicted felon wasn't a rally
1:30
it was a UFC championship match Carlos you want to tell us how this went down
1:35
so last Saturday night he showed up at uh an Ultimate Fighting Championship match at the credential Center in Newark
1:42
New Jersey he walked in with Kid Rock American Badass blaring in the arena
1:47
Donald Trump is in the building and the former president getting a standing ovation from the assembled masses here
1:54
at UFC 302 our times colleague sha mcre wrote about this
2:00
and said that the crowd was quote diverse in every way ethnicity age nationality except gender it was Fathers
2:07
and Sons men on the rone men in suits men in shorts now that is not a surprise
2:12
guys are the quintessential UFC demo but Trump's choice to make his first post-trial public appearance there I
2:20
think speaks to his appeal among let's say a certain kind of man and speaks to
2:27
the kind of tough guy persona that he he loves to project uh one of the women that was there Sean McCree spoke to her
2:34
and she said that Biden's not man enough to run the country it certainly is true
2:40
that Trump is trying to sell an image of not just like masculinity but sort of like a a patriarchal masculinity one
2:47
that's sort of a masculinity of dominance and so something like UFC where the the aim of the people in
2:54
the arena is to dominate the other person is very fitting but I mean the
3:00
UFC is specifically like a pretty right-wing cultural space that's been
3:06
the case for a while this is good politics right you go to a place where you're going to be welcomed but it's
3:12
sort of like yeah B if Biden were to go to like an NAACP national meeting I'm
3:18
sure he'd find an enthusiastic crowd there as well so David simply by showing up at this event it seems like he's
3:25
making a very explicit aggressive appeal to men in a very particular hyper
3:32
masculine way which has not just been seening like watching him on the trail you see him do this at regular rallies
3:38
well this is of a piece with what he's done for a long time I mean going back to pre-presidential race where he was at
3:43
WrestleMania with WWE and you know he had this moment where he actually quote
3:49
unquote wrestled at WrestleMania where he Clos lined Vince McMahon I believe
3:54
and then shaved his head in this sort of Quasi famous moment but the thing that
4:00
always gets me when I see him walking into these Arenas is the greeting he
4:06
gets is evidence of the success of his con this is a guy who sold toughness
4:14
basically out of whole cloth in the con is that he is the man's man the guy's
4:20
guy and he is absolutely not well just let me let me
4:26
complicate that a little bit especially when it comes to professional wrestling which is if you want to use one adjective to describe professional
4:32
wrestling and I would say even to an extent UFC it's Camp professional wrestling is camp for straight men
4:37
there's an advertising line and Donald Trump is a campy figure
4:43
right the multiple wives the many children the bragging about sexual assault that's all sort of like a
4:49
performance of like a a aggressive and and campy and dominance oriented
4:55
masculinity that really fits quite well in to the environment of professional L
5:00
and that is what people I think are responding to to the extent that they are like Trump as this Avatar of a it's
5:08
not like traditional masculinity but just sort of like an like I'll use the words aggressive and dominance oriented
5:14
again it's something that is designed to appeal to the insecurities of men who
5:21
believe and feel that they don't measure up to what men quote unquote are
5:28
supposed to be which is domineering and sexually aggressive it
5:34
it's sort of performance art masculinity there's talk of toxic masculinity this this is more sort of performative
5:40
masculinity not that the two I mean I'm sure there's an interesting ven diagram there but David mentioned the the
5:45
Wrestlemania stuff I mean he was hosting WrestleMania events in Atlantic City like in the 80s then the the Vince
5:50
McMahon thing was I think in 2007 but you you see how it evolves when he moves
5:57
from that Arena to the PO itical Arena it's um I'll pay your legal fees if you
6:03
rough up some protesters I like guys who weren't captured right and then you get to when the Looting starts the shooting
6:09
starts and finally you know you'll never take our country back with weakness you got to fight right so there's there's an
6:15
evolution there but it's so much of it feels you know in in part for for the
6:20
reasons that David alluded to at first that he doesn't really you know fit the part but it it it's it's performative in
6:26
many ways even if it has real life consequences so now I want to zoom out here to the general public and the
6:33
voting public specifically Trump does seem to have a message that's resonating with a broad section of men at the same
6:41
time you hear a lot of complaints that culture and the Democratic party are too feminized so David you find yourself in
6:49
a lot of conservative spaces why do you think Trump is resonating with so many men one of the thing the Dynamics right
6:55
now that's happening on the right is they're very good at finding extremist left expression so something that's very
7:03
very negative on quote unquote traditional masculinity so you take something that's pretty extreme on the
7:09
left and then what right-wing media is just really really good at is then saying take that extreme point of view
7:15
and push that forward as this is what they all think about you and so a narrative has spread that essentially
7:22
manhood itself is under attack that anything that you think of as traditional masculinity is under attack
7:29
now that doesn't mean you can't find somebody in like a women's studies department at Oberlin or something like
7:35
that who's going to have written something pretty radical but the extent to which in right-wing culture it has
7:40
imprinted at a very deep level that the left doesn't like men the left doesn't
7:48
like masculinity it's really hard to overstate that has become almost an
7:53
article of faith and rightwing America and so I mean Trump's not a manosphere
7:59
influence but we're seeing this in a number of people like the Andrew Tates the Jordan
8:04
Petersons The Joe Rogan where they're saying I'm standing up for men so if you
8:09
take a worldview where everyone to your left doesn't like men or doesn't like
8:16
masculinity and men are struggling in many ways which they are then you take a
8:22
look at somebody who's going to just stand up and say Men Are Great Men Are Awesome being a manly man is fantastic
8:28
there's nothing wrong with it and a lot of people are going to gravitate to that and that's part of the dynamic that's happening Jamelle do you think this goes
8:35
beyond conservative traditional voters um yes I mean it's important to
8:40
remember right that like most most voters aren't particularly ideological whatsoever right like they have
8:46
dispositions they have Tendencies or whatnot but there's no particular like ideological coherence and that even
8:52
someone as popular as Joe Rogan or Jordan Peterson is I wouldn't say nce
8:57
but like these are not you know they don't reach the broad swath of Voters but one of the
9:03
changes happening in terms of voting behavior is that young men of color black and Latino in particular are
9:10
moving to the right and there's many efforts to try to explain what's
9:15
happening here my own sense is that part of this is Trump related part of it is
9:21
not part of it that's not Trump related relates to a finding in um analysis of
9:27
the gender gap that's been around for like about a decade now and that finding is that perceptions of who a party
9:35
represents by way of who a party puts forward as Representatives really does shape how people understand each party's
9:44
relationship to gender and so the fact for example that Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton for president in 2016
9:51
really did communicate to a number of Voters that this is a party that is geared towards appealing to women which
9:57
for some number of male voters like turns them off the other one is that I think we have to think specifically
10:03
about what Trump has represented in popular culture so much of the key to Trump to me is recognizing him as a
10:10
figure whose pre-political Persona in some sense still overshadows his
10:16
political Persona that in some sense people still do not understand him as a guy who was literally the president of
10:21
the United States they understand him as a guy who was a celebrity and a celebrity businessman for a long time
10:26
and part of what Trump represented as a celebrity businessman he wasn't just a a
10:32
synonym for great wealth I was literally at the gym I was listening listening to Nelly and like Nelly like references
10:38
Trump in the same breath as Bill Gates like two many represent great wealth this is like a long-standing thing in like hip-hop culture so not just his
10:45
wealth but of kind of like an aspirational patriarchal identity I'm going to use that word again because I
10:52
think it's really important Trump has a bunch of wives and a bunch of kids and
10:57
he can provide for them and he can tell anyone who wants to tell him something to to f off all these things they're
11:03
part of I think like American culture but they are represented in a celebrity
11:09
Ganso form by Trump and that is appealing to I think a lot of young men who look at that implicitly or otherwise
11:16
and say that's the kind of authority I would like to wield Trump as aspiration
11:24
I think is so interesting Jamal it reminds me right away when when Barack Obama was in law school he and a
11:31
classmate of his co-authored a manuscript that was never published about public policy and American
11:36
politics and he talks you know briefly about Trump as this aspirational figure
11:43
in American culture you know he's like people say well like well you know maybe I'm not Donald Trump yet but my kids
11:48
will be this is like in the 90s right it shows you like you know the length of time during which Trump has performed
11:55
this aspirational service for us now I would say about a year ago on this
12:01
podcast we talked about this notion of the crisis of of men and boys looking at
12:06
the deteriorating outcomes in men's health and education even male friendships and if this crisis of men
12:13
involves a declining sense of purpose I would posit that the the toxic masculinity discourse maybe extends a
12:20
little bit further than the Oberlin you know gender studies adjunct faculty for
12:26
sure yeah for sure it does but still not to the extent that the wi EO chamber believes it does but to the extent that
12:32
that is indeed a sort of cultural presence then the appeal of a trumpian figure that reassures men however
12:39
crudely I think becomes much more understandable this conversation reminded me of a book by the New York
12:46
Times TV critic uh James pony wasik called audience of one exploring Trump's relationship to TV we all know how vital
12:53
The Apprentice was and remains to the rise of Donald Trump but Pon wazak also
12:59
suggest that the sort of broader cultural appeal of anti-hero
13:04
protagonists like in The Sopranos like in Breaking Bad right gave license and
13:09
encouragement for Americans to sort of cheer for the abrasive the ruthless the violent but also charismatic tough guy
13:17
and Trump has worked that Groove very very effectively Carlos I totally agree
13:23
with you that I you know I was exaggerating for a fact on Oberlin women's studies Department you did have
13:28
the American Psychological Association came out with a condemnation of what it
13:34
would call traditional masculinity ideology that went way too far in the
13:39
way that they took on traditional masculinity that is a real thing but at
13:45
the same time so coming from the right and coming from the south where there's
13:51
just lots of talk and Obsession about masculinity the thing that I just keep
13:56
going back to is the Mis match between Donald Trump and the way in which people
14:03
pre-trump conceived of masculinity and who was considered to be a masculine
14:09
ideal and that is the thing that a lot of us who sort of grew up in this look
14:14
at this and say what the heck is going on that's why I use a word like con so I'll give you a good example I don't
14:21
know if you guys remember the movie American Sniper yep yep this is the story of Chris Kyle and it was you know
14:27
I remember seeing it here in in Tennessee and you couldn't find a parking spot in our theater that movie
14:34
was an absolute sensation and one of the most memorable parts of that movie is
14:39
when Chris Kyle is involved in a playground fight and his father goes through this sheep dog sheep wolf
14:46
analogy and that is you know there's three kinds of people in this world there's the Sheep there are the Wolves
14:53
who prey on the sheep and the sheep dogs who protect the sheep from the wolf and
14:58
he said says I'm not raising any sheep in this household so what are you and at
15:05
that point Chris Kyle identifies himself as a sheep dog is somebody who protects the weak against the wolf okay and so
15:12
it's a very anti-bullying sort of vision of male courage and then Here Comes
15:19
Donald Trump who fits to a te the definition of a wolf of a bully the
15:25
story The Right told about itself was that they would be inoculated
15:32
against the wolf against the bully because they have this ethos of the sheep dog but then when the wolf arose
15:38
and the bully arose they went with the bully the very person that a generation
15:43
of young right-wing men were warned about and so that that's what makes this
15:49
in many ways so much more deeply disturbing even than it otherwise been because it called into question kind of
15:56
the cultural Enterprise that was happening before Trump yeah no I just wanted to make maybe just one quick
16:03
observation about the ways that the Embrace of trump might not be so in
16:09
congruous with these cultural patterns you can't tell David has that that lovely accent you can't tell from from
16:16
my voice beaten out of me by years of speech therapy as a child I'm also a southerner by birth and upbringing and
16:23
my sense is that the sort of laudible qualities of traditional forms of
16:28
masculin have to be balanced against sort of a real cultural heritage of various forms
16:36
of domination of people over others right like a cultural heritage in the South certainly of of you know going
16:43
back to slavery but like various forms of dependency and dominance sort of part of the cultural heritage of the South
16:49
that kind of have after lives into the present that can be seen in southern religious Traditions that can be seen in
16:56
how people organize households and so on so forth and so for as much as there is this very real sense that people ought
17:04
to defend the weak and stand against bullies out of trying to fulfill you know a traditional masculine role it is
17:11
also true that there are competing Traditions competing Notions of
17:17
masculinity that are very much in line with what Trump represents in not just
17:23
like the southern cultural tradition but like the American cultural tradition all righty let's take a quick
17:29
break when we come back we're going to get into whether Democrats have a men [Music]
17:53
problem and we're back so we've talked about Trump's gut level appeal for men
17:58
but I'm wondering if we can turn that question around are the Democrats and maybe even specifically President Biden
18:05
turning men off so one interesting thing if you look at the 2020 election results
18:11
uh basically Trump and Biden split men in 2020 um 48% of men voted for Biden
18:17
50% voted for Trump and this was a marked improvement from 2016 where 41%
18:23
of men voted for Clinton and 52% of men voted for Trump my sense at this point
18:30
relative to the polls is that this is just sort of like a Biden has a problem with voters is issue and not so much
18:37
specifically a a problem with men issue that is a much more sensible uh
18:45
conclusion I don't think we have enough evidence to say whether or not this is a specific problem with men but as we've
18:52
discussed already there are these gender gaps that are growing right and so you
18:58
know the the majority of black voters say they will vote for Biden in the election but to the extent that those
19:03
who say they were going to vote for Trump that group is disproportionately male right the same for Hispanic voters
19:08
and they tend to be young right they tend to be younger and of course white men so I do think that there is like
19:14
Republicans are coded as the male party in some sense Trump is coded as it's the
19:19
daddy party it's I wasn't going to say it but yeah it's the daddy party uh Stern Stern authoritarian father uh and
19:27
that is that is the niece the the cultural needs Trump occupies to an extent as well and so that's obviously
19:32
like an influence but again the 2020 results suggests that
19:37
like this is fluid and come October come November the Gap may be a little smaller
19:44
than it appears at this at this point or wider or wider you know who knows one
19:49
thing we haven't talked about is if you look at the polling data especially if you look at the gallop longitudinal data
19:56
men have stayed relatively constant ideologically and women have gotten a lot more liberal and this actually
20:02
started before Trump became president if you go back and you look around 2014 you
20:07
begin to see this big movement of young women in a much more liberal Direction
20:13
whereas men kind of are staying roughly around this kind of 25% in this 18 29
20:19
year old demographic of people who identify as liberal women have gone all the way up to 45 and settling around 40%
20:26
and there has been a much bigger gender gap in ideology than we've seen in years
20:31
past and this is very complicated it's going to have a lot of effects over the next several years in our nation but I
20:37
think part of this is due to the fact that men and women actually are just together less in in really meaningful
20:44
ways they're not dating as much they're getting married later in life uh there are fewer friends where they're hanging
20:51
out together there's less inperson time so a lot of this is men and women are
20:56
actually kind of pulling pulling apart in ways that transcend Donald Trump and
21:03
if that keeps pulling apart where women are especially young women are substantially more liberal than young
21:09
men you're going to see this divide almost no matter who the Republican is
21:17
so long as the Republican is not liberal so long as the Republican is still
21:22
embodying something about like as you were saying Michelle that that Daddy party element so does this map on to
21:28
policy in any way I mean we all hear about women's issues are do you guys think that there are specific policy
21:33
areas that would qualify as as men's issues or is this not about policy at all I mean if you if you look at the
21:40
time Sienna poll and the sort of gender breakdown on the question of like what is the one issue that matters most to
21:46
you for this election you see that the economy immigration and foreign policy all matter a little bit more for men
21:54
than for women uh abortion matters quite a bit more for women than than for men
22:00
but other than that I I just think it's may be hard to identify particular issues as being for men and any kind of
22:06
exclusive or overwhelming sense I suspect there's ways that we frame different issues that make them more or
22:13
less appealing and more or less Salient to to men I I don't think this is about
22:19
policy really at all um now if you meet somebody who's like a hardcore Maga dude
22:26
they will come back to immigration 99 days out of a 100 they will talk about the wall and they'll talk about
22:31
immigration although so do the women absolutely true the hardcore magga women go back to immigration but if you
22:39
really talk about this connection at the base level it is about the fighting of
22:45
the left the owning of the libs it is just whatever Trump is for as long as
22:52
he's not those guys is the source of the connection and the interesting thing is
22:58
Trump is such an empty suit on policy the idea that you're going to really aside from some of his few consistencies
23:05
on immigration and some on trade that there's a sort of almost diabolical
23:10
genius to that in a way because he then becomes the empty suit that everyone pours their policy preferences into and
23:17
so the Christian nationalists think he's going to be their great anti-porn Crusader which you can't even hardly say
23:25
out loud without laughing but industry hush money and then you have others who would
23:32
see him as your Great and Mighty Crusader for whatever their issue is the
23:37
neighborhood I live in is 85% Republican and the amount of policy discussion that I hear about why people are with Trump
23:44
is very low the amount that is all about fighting these other forces that I
23:50
talked about earlier whether it's you know the elite universities the American Psychological Association you name it
23:56
fighting those people that is what gets people out of bed in the morning and it
24:01
is not this well he has this policy suite and menu that appeals to men so is
24:07
there anything dims could do with their message or Messengers that would draw men back
24:13
in I think this is actually a really useful question because I want to distinguish between Democrats as a party
24:20
and sort of the left as a cultural movement so is there something that I would say that Democrats of a party have
24:27
done well I mean obviously it has very intentionally leaned into women's issues
24:33
because women are a larger proportion of the democratic party but that's what
24:40
parties do when they understand what their constituency is so it's sort of hard to fault them for leaning into
24:47
their own constituency but it isn't so much Democrats that really
24:52
motivate Republicans as the left and Republicans conflate the two completely
24:59
and so I do think that there are things on the left and I mentioned one of them this American Psychological Association
25:06
indictment of traditional masculinity ideology that just spread all over the place and that wasn't that's not part of
25:12
the democratic party platform but it sort of perceived as coming from the same world and the same universe and so
25:19
what you have often is it where the Democrats as a political entity and a political party are having to appeal to
25:28
voter ERS who have been turned off not by the Democrats but by the left and
25:34
those are different entities they're not identical entities and that think that creates some real political challenges
25:41
for the Democratic party I want to I just want to quickly second David's take
25:47
that people people get annoyed at a blue-haired barista and they think oh the left
25:53
right they see on Tik Tock someone you know complaining about men and they
25:59
think ah Democrats and they don't people don't make a distinction between you know a person that annoys them and like
26:06
a political party or even ideological movement right like someone just because someone has terrible opinions on XY or Z
26:13
doesn't mean they identify with a particular ideology but that in my experience people will be like why isn't
26:19
the left condemning and they'll point to a random person that annoys him on the internet I think that the fact that in
26:27
today's media environment we are all exposed to lots of people that annoy us
26:33
uh is an underrated aspect to polarization because you know the human brain is not
26:39
meant to be exposed to that many people who annoy you all right I'm gonna ask a final
26:46
question here which is looking forward where is this headed does it go away when Trump does or is this split GNA
26:52
just keep getting wider and wider I don't
26:58
think that this Dynamic is going to have all that all that many legs right like
27:04
there are other Republicans trying to do this sort of like masculinity thing manliness thing but I watched Josh Holly
27:13
at like the that that event you know in his like tight black T-shirt talks about masculinity and it was sort of like come
27:20
on man nice try because Trump has this pre-political
27:26
Persona that is where all the juice comes from and none of these other guys
27:32
who hope to kind of emulate Trump have that they don't have the same kind of
27:37
juice not Josh Holly not JD Vance not like any of them and so my sense is that
27:43
there there will still be a gender gap right the gender gap is a longstanding part of American politics but I don't
27:49
think we'll be having this kind of conversation without Trump In the Mix D
27:54
I I'm going to agree with Jamal on that you watch m crash and burn when Maga is
28:00
disconnected from the person of Donald Trump because what works for Trump doesn't work for Josh Holly there is a a
28:08
credibility that he has or a a pre-existing set of loyalties or
28:13
affection that he has that just nobody else does and then when they try to put on those Trump clothes so far they've
28:21
failed and they often end up looking not just vaguely ridiculous but actually ridiculous in the attempt
28:28
I have a maybe a a similar sort of concluding thought but perhaps a slight variation on a theme I imagine there'll
28:36
be a gender gap in the results of some kind and an election that's as close as people anticipate this one will be will
28:42
be able to point to many factors including the gender gap as completely decisive right um now the only thing
28:48
I'll I'll venture to say beyond that is that I don't know that this goes away
28:54
when Trump goes away the the one question I've I've wrestled with throughout the sort of trump years is
28:59
whether Trump changed the country or revealed the country and I think it's
29:05
both I think he changed it by revealing it right and the the fault lines that he loves to stomp on won't go away when
29:12
when he exits the scene and what I kind of hope is that once he's not this sole
29:18
Force kind of like forcing us to choose you know you're your Maga or your resistance you're Pro Trump or you're
29:24
against him then we'll have to deal with these issues more directly we have to move beyond the kind of pro or
29:31
anti-trump discourse and delve into these more meaningful and painful
29:37
debates that will still be present is that the truth all right on on that upbeat note here obviously if you wrap
29:44
all of this together what does it add up to Dwayne the Rock Json in 2028 there
29:49
you go you heard it here first the answer to our National Prayer there we have it there you go all right Lads
29:55
we've got to leave it there many many things thanks for your insights and expertise we're going to take a break
30:02
and when we come back one of you is going to get hot or cold
30:13
[Music]
30:29
[Music] and we're back and it is time for hot
30:34
cold that magical moment when one of us shares something we're into over or
30:40
somewhere in between so my panel who has the hot cold for us I I believe I've
30:45
been appointed oh sweet and I'm going with the hot element and it's the WNBA
30:51
right now because there's some drama going down and it's around the Caitlyn Clark phenomenon
30:58
so Caitlyn Clark Iowa basketball player was a sensation in college broke Pete
31:04
mich's all-time scoring record she holds the record for both men and women there were games in the women's tournament the
31:10
NCAA Women's tournament that had higher ratings than the men's tournament for the first time ever and so she came into
31:17
the WNBA with an ocean of hype around her and encountered a bunch of very
31:24
world-class athletes who have a lot of pride and were had no intention of
31:30
allowing a rookie to walk in and dominate the league and the result has been a lot of uh rough play a lot of
31:39
questioning of Caitlyn Clark's abilities and talents questioning whether you know everything from very meta to is she only
31:46
viewed as sort of this great Transcendent talent because she's white to much more sort of normal basketball
31:54
drama of the new kid on the block has to pay her dues and all culminating is all
31:59
things do and should in a tremendous rant by one of the great living Americans Sir Charles Barkley who
32:07
admonished the women of the WNBA to don't be as Petty as the men because oh
32:13
I want to fight for women's right to be Petty come on now he was saying there's an enormous amount of pettiness being
32:19
poured out upon Caitlyn Clark you women out there no pity man which is exactly
32:26
what happens when a young very hyped star comes in to the NBA as well but the
32:32
whole thing is fascinating and it's probably the most discussion that we have seen of the WNBA and games in the
32:39
WNBA in the history of the league and it's fascinating I'm here for it and
32:45
have yall followed any of this so I don't watch the games I'm embarrassed to say but I just cannot avoid the clips on
32:53
social media and they are both salty and juicy and they are so delicious and this
32:58
is exactly what I think the league needs to get it the attention that it is often
33:04
not able to drum up so I'm I'm all for it I'm all about it I also love the the
33:09
sort of rivalries that are emerging not just among teams among players so I love
33:14
the drama I love the the commentators that say idiotic things and um and then
33:21
you know worry about walking it back I love that Barkley's in the middle of it because he's always been one of the most outspoken both as a player you know I'm
33:28
not a role model and as a commentator and also David you know I have struggled to get Sports on matter of opinion so I
33:35
am just eternally grateful for you to to at least raise it in a in in a hot cold
