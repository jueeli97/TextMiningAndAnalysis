hey matter of opinion listeners it's
0:04
Michelle car stay tuned for a very
0:07
special episode on the presidential
0:09
debate that we'll have coming up on
0:11
Friday be excited trust me but while you
0:16
wait I wanted to share something I've
0:18
been thinking about recently as a
0:19
correspondent covering National politics
0:22
which is how much Maga is too much Maga
0:25
when Trump isn't on the ticket enjoy
0:29
[Music]
0:37
House member Lauren bobert is
0:39
approaching the end of a primary fight
0:41
for her political future bobert is the
0:45
ultra Maga over-the-top House member
0:48
from
0:49
Colorado who is known depending on how
0:54
you want to slice it either for like
0:56
wanting to impeach Joe Biden and
0:59
heckling him during his State of the
1:01
Union speech or for getting thrown out
1:04
of a Denver theater when she was caught
1:09
vaping and playing gry with her
1:12
date so she loses Tuesday's primary she
1:16
will be probably by far the flashiest
1:19
Trump minion to fall if she wins it will
1:22
be in part because of her ability to
1:25
modulate her message for different
1:27
audiences just like regular old
1:29
politicians so often have to do and
1:32
either way her Fate's going to tell us
1:34
something about the limits of extreme
1:36
trumpism by candidates not named Trump
1:40
and also how much room these kind of
1:42
candidates have to maneuver within the
1:44
strictures of the magav
1:48
verse the tricky thing about Colorado
1:51
for the GOP is that it is a purple
1:53
trending Blue State and in 2022 she came
1:58
just a few
2:00
votes close to losing a safe Republican
2:04
house seat to a largely unknown Democrat
2:08
so she has since moved across the state
2:11
to the east side and is now running in a
2:13
district that is even more safely
2:16
Republican but in her new District some
2:18
of the voter rich areas aren't really
2:20
that mag Republican so much as they are
2:23
like old school Republican like Mitt
2:25
Romney or Liz Cheney all of this has her
2:28
scrambling to weak Her Image expand her
2:31
appeal went over her new hopeful
2:34
constituents so I felt like I just had
2:37
to go out to Colorado just to see how
2:39
she was doing it was kind of a tale of
2:42
two
2:46
bobberts okay so I'm at the wide open
2:48
Saloon in Douglas County Colorado
2:50
talking with fans of Lauren Boart the
2:53
wide open Saloon event was this kind of
2:56
upscale biker bar that was just bobert
3:01
fans and Trump fans are you a big bobert
3:05
fan yes I am so how long have you been
3:08
paying attention to her I guess I saw
3:11
her on TV with Trump and uh Trump is not
3:17
perfect but he's my man he's your man
3:19
he's my man and uh she supports him and
3:22
we've got to get this country back on
3:24
track you know there's lots of biker
3:26
gear and anti-biden t-shirts and Maga
3:29
hat
3:30
and bobert could really just trumpet up
3:34
and appeal to the part of the party that
3:37
the fans of hers on national TV and in
3:40
conservative circles just absolutely
3:42
adore we have Patriots in the
3:46
house God thank you so much for opening
3:48
up the wide open Saloon and bringing so
3:51
many wonderful hardworking red blooded
3:55
conservative Americans who are tired of
3:58
the political person execution the
4:01
election
4:02
interference the demise of our country
4:05
and our constitution every one of us
4:08
here is ready to take a stand and take
4:11
back our state and take back our country
4:16
but most of the stuff I saw when I was
4:18
following her around was much lower key
4:20
and was not that kind of in
4:23
yourface
4:24
antagonistic over-the-top attitude she's
4:28
trying to convince her new District that
4:31
she is more than just her Maga Warrior
4:35
self that when she needs to she can be
4:38
very pragmatic she can be very
4:40
productive that she can work to get
4:43
things done I mean I do think she is an
4:46
interesting example of what do you do
4:49
when you're this Maga person but you're
4:51
too Maga and you got to figure out can
4:55
you D Maga without losing Maga
5:00
[Music]
5:02
it is wonderful to be here in Washington
5:05
County tonight thank you so much to the
5:06
Farm Bureau for putting this on so there
5:09
was an event way out in the middle of
5:11
nowhere it was this tiny candidate Forum
5:14
sponsored by the local Farm Bureau where
5:18
she was talking about forging
5:20
compromises with Democrats to get stuff
5:23
done which was absolutely not the sort
5:27
of thing that her Maga National base
5:30
wants to hear about water water water
5:32
this is absolutely uh one of our most
5:35
important issues here in Colorado and
5:38
when it comes to water I have
5:39
legislation that I have co-sponsored
5:41
with our Senators forming coalitions
5:44
with Democrats that is common sense and
5:47
does not compromise our Republican
5:50
principles so in this campaign she is
5:52
looking to balance what kind of feels
5:55
irreconcilable which is this Persona as
5:58
an uncompromised in overthe toop Maga
6:01
Warrior hellbent on destroying the lives
6:05
and saving America from
6:09
wishy-washiness and this message to
6:11
skeptical coloradans that she's an
6:14
effective legislator who is pragmatic
6:17
enough to deliver on the issues they
6:19
care about even if that occasionally
6:22
means collaborating with the political
6:24
enemy and this speaks to kind of a a
6:27
bigger problem that the Republican party
6:31
is facing which is that very few
6:33
politicians other than Trump can get
6:36
away with just hardcore trumping all the
6:38
time and I mean heck even he lost the
6:41
presidency in
6:45
2020 I specifically asked her kind of
6:48
about the tensions between balancing her
6:52
National brand with her need to present
6:56
a kind of more pragmatic approach
7:00
to local voters or whatever and she
7:01
dismissed the idea that there was any
7:05
tension there and in fact when when
7:08
talking about the current race she was
7:10
like very clear she has only one speed
7:13
I'm radically Lauren vo I she's
7:15
radically Lauren
7:17
bber which yes this is absolutely true
7:21
she is radically Lauren bber I don't
7:23
think anybody would dispute that of
7:24
course the question and maybe the
7:27
problem is even in some of these
7:28
conservative
7:30
congressional districts it's not quite
7:33
clear how far is too far with the
7:36
trumpism being radically Lauren
7:39
bobert may prove to be too much even for
7:43
many Republican
