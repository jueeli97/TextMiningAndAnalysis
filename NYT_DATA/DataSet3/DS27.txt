we don't have Carlos's rage where where's the rage I'm missing the sizzling hot tox
0:08
mascul L of spice as as Jimmy Carter wrote in his 25th
0:13
Memoir Jimmy Carter lusted in his heart he did lust in his heart uh
0:20
[Music] Jimmy from New York Times opinion I'm Michelle coddle I'm Ross D and I'm Lydia
0:27
pgreen and this is matter of [Music]
0:38
opinion all right my friends it is gender week on matter of opinion oh boy
0:44
I know right I'm going to hear Let me hear something you'll notice you'll notice that Carlos has uh tragically
0:50
found some other other important commitment to carry him away from us yes he is sadly out this week and let's be
0:57
clear I have promised him he will be punished but we will Soldier on nonetheless and
1:02
today we're going to talk about how gender shapes our political choices and the
1:09
world so a new article just came out showing that men and women are getting more and more politically divided
1:15
especially among gen Z so first I want to go back in time a bit and I'm curious whether you all remember a gender
1:22
political split growing up I mean were your parents of similar political Persuasions uh mine absolutely were and
Parents
1:30
and my parents parents absolutely were um at least on on the American side I
1:35
don't know about the Ethiopian side there were lots of things that were happening there that could turn things Topsy Turvy but both of my grandparents
1:42
were kind of stalwart Goldwater Republicans you know big fans of Ronald Reagan conservative die hards and all of
1:49
their children became very liberal Democrats and my mother once she became an American was also a very liberal Democrat all right Ross what about you
Family Dynamics
1:57
yes I mean basically the same um we were sort of all good Bill Clinton Democrats
2:04
when I was little and then by the time I was a teenager they were sort of conflicted Democrats with some
2:10
conservative leanings and sort of in terms of overall family Dynamics on both sides of the family almost everyone was
2:18
a Democrat which made my you know my my ideological Evolution has you know
2:25
remain just went rogue didn't you every day my father wakes up and looks in the mirror and says how did it come to this
2:32
see uh my father can sympathize though yes no I I know so you too right Michelle you grew up you know oh yeah my
2:39
parents were both good conservative like culturally conservative Republicans this this wasn't a case of like economic
2:47
conservative and social liberalism they were down the line conservatives and and still really are so yes much like the
2:54
doubt at parents my parents are just not entirely sure of where they went wrong with me but you know in general for
3:01
decades in the US there has been not necessarily within families but at least a slight political gender gap with Women
3:08
Voters leaning more liberal more democratic than the men do but in recent years that Gap has widened and
3:15
overwhelmingly because of younger women moving left so there's been a lot of
3:21
chatter about this of late who wants to kind of break down this latest argument
3:26
that gen Z in particular is facing a quote great gender Divergence yeah I mean this
Male Female Divergence
3:33
has been sort of a as you said Michelle there's been a sort of real gender gap
3:38
in especially us voting for many election Cycles women more likely to
3:44
vote for Democrats men more likely to vote for republicans and over the last few years there's been some evidence
3:51
that there's an actual Divergence happening here where jenz women are
3:57
still becoming more liberal becoming more liberal more rapidly than in the past with maybe an inflection point
4:04
around the me2 era we can get into what the actual inflection point might be and
4:10
men are either remaining a little bit more conservative or becoming a bit more
4:15
conservative still um now as with everything involving social science research there's debates about how big a
4:22
split this is how real it is how big the split is depends on which data set you use but the most recent entry into this
4:30
discussion was a a big piece by the financial times writer John burn Murdoch that looked at this trend across a bunch
4:37
of different countries and found pretty similar Trends in the US Germany in the
4:43
United Kingdom and South Korea so I think we have enough evidence at this point to say that you know how big it is
4:49
is open to debate but in gen Z there's a real male female Divergence that's
4:55
different from the gender gap of the up till the recent past so Lydia just this
5:00
s on point to you I mean what are your thoughts yeah no I think you know it's interesting right because the global nature of it is really fascinating I
5:06
mean you know look at Poland for example which has sort of like taken a turn back towards more kind of liberal democracy
5:12
in its most recent election but among men 18 to 21 almost half of their votes
5:18
went to the kind of hard-right Confederation party which is compared to just a sixth of the women in the same age bracket and that's not the populist
5:26
right party that has governed Poland and inspired a lot of angst among Western
5:32
liberals what deserve it or not that's the further right exactly exactly so I
5:37
think you're definitely seeing something that is real right and then there are just sort of other trends like you know
5:42
Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus men are on YouTube women are on Tik Tok and you know that takes them on these is
5:49
sort of very yeah men spend much much more time on on YouTube and women spend much much more time on Tik Tok and that
5:55
takes them on very different Journeys so I do think that there are all of these ways in which men and women are
6:01
diverging in their cultural tastes in their life sort of aspirations and things like that so of course it seems
6:07
very natural that that would show up in politics well it does strike me that it's a as a global Trend that always
6:14
makes it more of a challenge to tease out the root causes I mean what do you guys see as aside from the media
6:21
ecosystems which these days we can blame almost anything on Echo Chambers and ecosystems and Bubbles and and I think
6:27
it's partly true but what are some of the other major trends that you both see driving this either in the US
6:33
specifically or abroad well to get back to your initial Point Michelle where you were talking about our parents and
Decline in Marriage Rates
6:40
grandparents and their usually fairly shared politics there's one basic
6:46
Chicken and the Egg question which is this is linked in some way to declining
6:52
marriage rates and declining rates of relationship formation so if you look
6:57
for instance just at American vter Behavior the gender gap is actually often a marriage Gap where married women
7:06
are more likely to vote for conservative parties and single women are much much
7:12
much more likely to vote for Liberal parties so in a way it's you could say well it's not surprising that as
7:19
marriage rates go down men and women diverge more politically because marriage is often the way that people
7:25
bring their worldviews into alignment but then you could argue it the other way and say no it's that the Divergence
7:31
is making the marriage rate go down right because and so you have all these stories about again it's usually liberal
7:38
women saying they don't want to date conservative men although you don't have to go very far on the internet to find
7:44
conservative men saying that they don't want to date they don't want to date Taylor Swift they well yeah we we we'll
7:50
get we should get into that but I'm getting into so so so that's just an example of how clearly this trend is
7:57
bound up in some way with the decline of marriage and even the decline of romantic and sexual relationships but
8:04
what is driving what is a little bit unclear yeah I fall down on the side of
8:09
the more kind of women have become independent financially and have more
8:15
freedom it's it's not that they dislike men it's just that they get choosier I mean I have stories floating around my
8:23
own family about in the generations above me if only X had had more finan
8:29
Freedom she would have left her husband right no I think I think that's exactly right and I think you know it's worth dwelling for a moment on how recent a
8:37
lot of the changes to women's lives in the United States in particular are I
8:43
mean were just barely a century removed from the passage of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote women
8:49
needed permission from their husbands to open a bank account it really wasn't until 1974 which is the year before I
8:54
was born that women were guaranteed the ability to open a bank account without their husband's permission um marital
9:01
rape was only made illegal Nationwide in 1993 that was my first year of college
9:08
wow so you know the idea that like women's bodies were the property of their husband and they could do with them what they would um you know that is
9:15
only fairly recently been banished of course you know birth control not very old abortion access via row divorce laws
9:23
liberalized they started in the 1960s so the idea that women had some choices of
9:29
about how they were going to live their lives in the public sphere is a really
9:34
really really new thing in the grand scheme of how societies get made and I
9:39
think the massive massive accelerant of the past few years is of course and Ross alluded to this the meoo movement which
9:45
I think went off like a bomb and created a lot of questions about how much progress had actually been made over the
9:51
last century as as women sort of came into public life and then of course the other thing that's much much more recent
9:57
but I think has uh potentially even more seismic effect on American politics is the fall of row and what seems to be an
10:03
aspiration to take on birth control um you know take on no fault divorce and
10:09
all of these things that to a lot of women seem aimed at rolling back the clock and you know look one of the best
10:16
definitions of conservatism is like a kind of backward-looking politics right I mean let's return let's go back let's
10:23
and women look back and they're like I don't want that that's not a life that I'm aspiring to so that's my sort of
10:29
brand analysis and Theory Ross go no I mean I I think to some degree I agree
Economic Independence
10:34
certainly the scale of economic independence that young women experience
10:39
today has no parallel in really in human history as as far as we can tell so you
10:45
would expect that to change dating norms and romantic Norms in in ways that then
10:51
interact with people's political perspectives I think the more specific you get to American politics the harder
10:59
it is to explain the global Trend so the fall of row happens in 2022 but if
11:07
you're looking at the chart on the ideology Gap in South Korea or Germany
11:12
the big inflection point is really somewhere in the mid-2010s but I think you have sort of deep structural forces
11:19
the economic empowerment of women being an incredibly important one but then you have something and I think internet life
11:27
and internet culture has to play some really important role here because like a lot of things change clearly in the
11:34
2010s you know sort of changes in mental health changes in our politics both
11:40
trumpism and the great awokening happened sort of in that period That's why I found the Tik Tok versus YouTube
11:47
thing really interesting there there's something there about the way the sex has experienced Digital Life that has to
11:53
be encouraging alienation from one another so this speaks to a piece of this that really does concern and you
11:59
may be able to shed a little light on this Ross as as a man you mean no well
12:05
just glad we have an expert you know as a conservative so one of the things that worries me is that in many cases this
12:14
has the advancement of women and I don't know if we we look at it from the me to lens or what is seen as a zero sum game
12:22
which is that it's almost an adversarial thing like in order for women to kind of
12:28
flex and and get out from under a lot of these traditional problems men are feeling put upon and in some cases they
12:35
are being talked about as though they are the problem and I see this with like
12:41
my kids friends you know young men in college I've brought this up before they just feel like Society has decided that
12:50
young men are just generically a problem and this then makes them vastly more
12:57
open to the Andrew rates you know the conservative misogynistic social media
13:04
phenomenon and then the Social Media stuff comes into play where they can find lots of people just like them who
13:10
are feeling that way and lots of very cynical media personalities who are making their Fortune by whipping up this
13:18
kind of Us Versus Them sense and the whole well they're not letting men be men I mean Trump does this to some
13:24
degree on the presidential Trail but it's this whole adversarial you are the problem in order
13:31
for my gender to advance right uh that they that young men seem to have
13:36
absorbed well I mean it's a weird we have a very weird cultural moment on this front where on the one
Cultural Moment
13:43
hand if you look at the highest offices in the land Corporate America and so on
13:49
like most politicians are still men though there are plenty of female politicians most corporate leaders are
13:55
still men right so if you look at that piece of the landscape you would say well yeah it makes sense to sort of
14:01
spend a lot of time talking about the empowerment of women and expect men to just sort of suck it up and recognize
14:07
that they need to give a little ground but then if you look at like who's graduating from college and who's doing
14:13
well in the workforce in their 20s and 30s it's much more likely to be women
14:19
than to be men so that creates this Dynamic where yeah if you're a young man and you're looking around you and you go
14:26
to a good college and the student body is probably more female than male everyone's wearing you know the future
14:31
is female t-shirts like you have just huge gaps in a lot of places in female
14:37
college completion rates versus male College completion rates and so on yeah I think it's quite natural for young men
14:42
to say well we have a society organized around the advancement of women and I'm a man and in my cohort like our role
14:51
isn't clear we're blamed for a lot of things we're slipping behind who's looking out for me sure but like a few
14:58
things right one one thing that was alighted in a lot of the discourse about sort of men falling behind really really
15:03
really kind of um underemphasized or just ignored the sort of racial component of it I mean black men are
15:10
slipping behind uh you know women in general but black women in particular at much much much higher rates and some of
15:17
this data you know I think we're thinking of it as like men RIT large but in fact there's like a tremendous amount
15:22
of variation depending on class depending on race and all those kinds of things like you know affluent white men I think are actually doing pretty darn
15:28
well as well as they've ever done and I I found some really fascinating uh research that found that specifically on
15:34
like why didn't you complete College onethird of men like fully a third of them were like I just didn't feel like
15:40
it you know about a quarter of women gave the same same response but it was a significantly higher proportion of men who are just like eh I didn't really
15:47
want to so I I think that there is this kind of like boohoohoo like you know what about the men that it sort of feels
15:53
like they don't like The Vibes rather than not liking the reality well but suppose okay but suppose those numbers
15:59
were reversed Lydia right and it was that women were more likely to say I didn't finish college because I didn't
16:06
feel like it and men were more likely to cite a material reason we would have you
16:11
know a hundred op-eds the next day by people talking about like what structural and psychological forces
16:18
could possibly be leading women to feel like they just don't feel like finishing College this must be the legacy of
16:25
patriarchy embedded in the structure of college that makes women feel like The Vibes don't work for them and if we need
16:31
to overthrow patriarchy we need to change the Vibes right but so when it's men doing it you're like oh boohoo you
16:36
were lazy and wanted to drop out and you know watch we live through we live through a huge news cycle of hand
16:42
ringing about all of this boys and men stuff we just read about it endlessly like I just don't like I don't I mean
16:48
there were like five there were like five pieces no come on Ross don't don't yes no it's true after Decades of a
16:55
particular narrative people looked around and said oh wait a minute men men don't seem to be doing that well but
17:00
again like after Millennia a millennia of living under the oldest and most you know durable hierarchy which is the
17:07
hierarchy between men and women right like so I I mean like if we're counting time right there's been a lot less time
17:14
that we've been thinking about women's Freedom women's empowerment women's ability to exist in the world separate from men so this is all like relatively
17:21
new and the reaction from you know boys and men to that emerging power of women
17:27
has gotten I would say a disproportionate amount of well perhaps but like the 20 I mean again like just
Millennial Patriarchy
17:33
since I'm here to represent you know the 21y old male right represent my friend fly that flag well the 21-year-old male
17:40
might say well what is the umine Millennia of patriarchal subjugation of
17:45
women have to do with me he I was not around for cure laws I was not around in
17:52
medieval France or 8th Century Arabia or wherever else why is it just that I
17:57
should be asked to like suck it up for the sake of you know the advantages that my male ancestors had that have nothing
18:04
to do with my own life now right when we get to the phrase Millennial patriarchal subjugation I'm just going to have to
18:09
jump in here and and say I think I I do think Lydia's point about the economics
18:15
is a big one yes and it's also I think probably a little bit what we're seeing
18:21
with the Trump phenomenon where Trump is actually making a fair amount of Headway with young black and Latino men who are
18:29
feeling like their white counterparts in many cases left behind by the fastmm
18:35
moving culture and are looking for someone who is telling them that he's
18:41
looking out for them and so we're entering this weird kind of new Dynamic
18:49
that I we haven't seen in a long while where there's actually the leader of a
18:54
major party coming out and saying enough is enough culture has become too
19:00
feminized men kind of rally which just just to to offer a a global note if you
Gender Split in Politics
19:08
look at the politics of South Korea there is in fact a much more extreme version of this yeah this is you not
19:14
just Trump the the right of Center party is is much more explicit about saying
19:19
you know feminism like Trump doesn't stand up and say feminism has gone too far he's vager about it but you have
19:26
it's so hard to be a young man in this era you know you can't sexually harass women that sort of thing but he doesn't
19:33
say that no he did say it during the Brett Kavanagh sexual harassment hearings he said oh I would hate to be a
19:39
young man it's just so hard to get by right but so I'm just saying there's a more overt form of this politics in the
19:47
more gender polarized landscape of South Korea yeah but I think there's also just like stuff going on with gender and
19:53
sexuality just more broadly uh that I think is also a part of this I was looking at some data from the public
19:59
religion Research Institute that found that 28% of genz people uh adult an
20:06
teens identify as lgbtq in some form and that's up from 16% of Millennials that's
20:13
a really really really big shift now this data didn't break it down by gender but so much of The Angst about
20:19
particularly trans kids I think centers on trans masculine children and this idea that like you know little girls are
20:27
rejecting femininity and they're basically sort of choosing either to be trans masculine or to be
20:32
non-binary and I feel like that's part of this story too is that like there's this sense that something just bigger is
20:39
going on with the ways in which young people think about their gender their sexuality all of these things that
20:45
freaks people out and I have young adults in my household and I you see this across the board just kind of this
20:52
kind of fluidity that people are talking about but I want to know if like talking about the gender the gender split in
20:59
politics I want to know how concerned we should be I mean is is this growing split basically going to destroy human
21:05
civilization because nobody can get along and get together and have children and the species stops yes these are the
21:10
questions that are keeping me up at night Ross so so after the break let's get into what all of this means for the
21:16
[Music]
21:27
future
Should We Care
21:35
[Music]
21:40
so we've talked through the causes or some of the causes at least to the growing ideological split between men
21:46
and women but really should anyone much care I mean what do we see the looming
21:52
consequences of this or are we just blowing it out of proportion I think it definitely has very sign ific
21:58
consequences right I mean like when one half of the population goes in One Direction and the other half goes in
22:03
another you're going to have friction you're going to have conflict I feel as though the answer is always to sort of
22:10
find ways through through compromise and through sort of finding these these ways
22:15
to have lives of Greater Equity to like welcome more women into like the public sphere but you know the moment that
22:21
we're living in right now is one that in some ways like sort of pulls in exactly the opposite direction I was recently having a conversation with someone who's
22:27
in the business of trying to recruit University presidents and uh they told me that not a single woman wants to be a
22:34
un new University president right now because everyone is worried about being torn to pieces you know so I think I
22:41
think that like we are living in this moment where it's not just that men are feeling disempowered I also think that
22:46
women are like wait a minute when we stick our heads above the parapet in like meaningful ways our nexs are on the
22:52
line in ways that like may or may not be worth it so I think that it's possible that even in this moment you could see a
22:58
kind of self-c consed retreat from public life among certain women particularly women in powerful positions
23:03
cuz it's just not worth it you look skeptical Ross my friend I would I would bet against that but interesting I mean
The Political Challenge
23:10
I think the the challenge here right is that there's the political challenge that any form of sort of identity-based
23:18
polarization creates problems for society and we have a lot of different
23:23
forms of polarization but the scope of this is sort of Novel and we don't know what it will mean for our politics but
23:30
then this is also a form of polarization that is literally separating the two
23:36
populations whose Union is necessary for the continuation of the human race and
23:43
you heard me reference South Korea repeatedly as a more extreme example of
23:48
gender polarization in politics and that's not just sort of a interesting
23:53
you know academic point about a small rich country in Northeast Asia because
23:59
South Korea is also a Harbinger in the total and utter collapse of fertility
24:06
rates and of course you know regular listeners of this podcast know that I am
24:12
you know interested in the problem of birth rates uh worldwide and in the developed world and concerned about the
24:18
consequences of demographic decline modest demographic decline leads to
24:25
slower economic growth even potentially negative economic growth it leads to
24:31
incredible burdens on old age pension systems because you don't have enough younger workers paying into them and it
24:38
leads to a lot of alienation and literal physical isolation so if you look though
24:44
at cases like South Korea and there are other countries headed rapidly in that
24:49
direction we aren't talking about something that's sort of a you know
24:54
interesting sociological and economic question question of like well what does society look like as it ages and has
25:01
fewer kids we're looking at um the potential for actual crisis and actual
25:08
collapse like South Korea's fertility rate is in the SS right now which means
25:14
roughly for every two people there is 7ish Offspring if you just project that
25:21
Trend forward South Korea's population doesn't just like diminish it starts to
25:29
actually collapse over a like two generation time scale and you have like
25:34
huge cities as ghost towns and empty skyscrapers everywhere and not enough people to you know staff the Armed
25:41
Forces of South Korea which as we know have a fairly important job to do given
25:47
that they share a peninsula with a lunatic totalitarian regime and so again
25:52
as I said it's a totally open question how political polarization and declining
25:57
marriage rates and family formation rates interact but they clearly are interacting in ways that are
26:05
accelerating things and turning my slightly crank is Obsession into what
26:10
might end up being the most important story of the 21st century L you don't look convinced no I mean I I think as
26:16
the one person in this group who who doesn't have children I sleep well at night knowing that my brethren in Africa
26:22
and the times has done some great reporting on this that you know that there's just a huge population explosion happening
26:28
you know there are lots of people in the world there are lots of new people being made in the world there are lots of
26:34
people who are living in places where they might not be able to live for very much longer and they will need to move
26:40
to new places and a world in which people are more freely able to move and
26:45
live together and take care of one another is the world that I want to live in less a world in which we're obsessed
26:51
with you know replicating the existing structure of nation states with hard borders and sad 19th Century Real
27:00
politique about who lives where and why so I guess like it's it's just not a preoccupation of mine you know um well
27:07
what do you what what do we think is going to like so just stick with the South Korean example right so yes it's
27:13
true that that South Korea could take the entire population of mosm Beek and
27:18
move it to South Korea and then at least for a certain amount of time it wouldn't have a population problem even in
27:25
subsaharan Africa birth rates are declining and subsaharan Africa is
27:31
at this point the only region in the globe that has serious above replacement
27:37
fertility it's not something where there's like a first world that isn't having kids and the rest of the world is
27:43
uh birth rates in Latin America are going down generally it's down below two in some places it's as low as 1.4 1.3 so
27:52
what is your answer for encouraging people to have children because the progressive answer is often well you need to to make the social safety net
27:58
better the social safety net in Europe's pretty damn good and they're not having kids either and you can say well get
28:06
everybody back in church and put women back in their place which seems to be the answer on the far right that's
28:12
really not an option either so I think what we're looking at here is why are
28:18
people not having kids and a lot of the reasons are very good ones and if you
28:24
just look at the us the answer is in part cuz having kids is hard and
28:29
thankless and used to be that's just what women did now I happen to think
28:35
having kids is also one of the most fantastic human experiences and if you miss out on it then you you know you
28:41
make a different choice and that's fine but you you got to address the fact that
28:47
it's not really just economic and you're not going back to the you know 1650s so
28:53
how do you address it from that perspective maybe maybe Russ wants to go back to to the there are people I I do
28:59
not wish to go back to 1650s not specifically I mean I think basically when the problem is your birth rate is
The Broken Bargain
29:07
you know 1.5 and it would be better if it was two then it's a sort of somewhat
29:12
normal policy problem and you can argue about what kind of social safety net you
29:17
should have and in those arguments I have sympathies with liberals I I I'm
29:24
one of the conservatives who favors the you know new child tax credit Provisions
29:29
that Congress is considering this week those things have the potential to make it economically easier to have and rear
29:37
kids and they can affect the birth rate on the margins but there are clearly just deeper profound cultural forces at
29:44
work here which is why this trend shows up everywhere it's not just an East Asian problem it's a European problem
29:51
it's an American problem you know you can have conservative governments you can have liberal governments there is
29:56
something about Hightech late modernity that is deeply deeply anti-natal anti-birth and there's
30:05
a problem here that is deeper than policy and I'm not I don't offer a profound solution for it except that
30:13
like it is worth taking it seriously as a problem but I also think that there's
30:19
still this kind of broken bargain around this sort of relationship between women and men like are women going to pay a
30:27
disproportionate price for childbearing in terms of their economic potential are they going to pay a disproportionate
30:33
price in terms of their ability to pursue other outside interests and friendships and things like that and I
30:38
think that those are things that I hear from my friends who are making decisions about whether or not to have kids or
30:44
whether or not to have another child it's not just economic it's also about the sort of classic Battle of the sexist
30:49
stuff yeah the latter is what I worry more about because as noted there's lots of different countries with lots of
30:55
different social safety nets and none of them have solved this problem what we have is
31:00
the old social contract was very clear men went out and earned the money took care of that part women stayed home and
31:07
did the family that doesn't hold at least in the US anymore and so we have
31:13
not yet found a better balance until that new contract becomes clearer of
31:21
course you're going to have a lot of ambivalence I I agree that there is a
The Nuclear Family
31:26
there is a failure to develop a model of male female relations that balances the
31:35
expectations of a more egalitarian and feminist Society with the fact that women get pregnant and men don't and you
31:42
do in fact need some kind of balance where the man in many relationships does
31:50
end up doing more work outside the home because he's not the one bearing the children right let's be clear it's not
31:56
the pregnancy it's the raising of the children I mean
32:01
the it's also the pregnancy right if you have three kids but that's nine months
32:06
well it's actually 10 months they lie to you right that's true it's 40 weeks but I I I also think that we've been talking
32:12
about this all exclusively in the context of the nuclear family and I think that there have been times and places in society where much broader
32:21
networks of kinship of community have had responsibility for raising of
32:26
children and also of like keeping marriages going and like the thing that's interesting to me is like I have
32:32
a lot of queer friends who have gone to extraordinary lengths in order to create families and those families have
32:39
different bonds of kinship so I do think that there is a sense of like possibility and we could build you know
32:46
a different and and better world and different kinds of communities some of them are things that we recover from the past sum are things that we will build a
32:52
new but I guess like I I think that part of the the problem is like we're viewing this in a very kind of like narrow lens
32:58
of the nuclear family and the nuclear family like has not been so amazing for women right well if you think the
33:05
nuclear family is not amazing for women there are a lot of family models that have been a lot less amazing for women
33:12
in history so beyond the birth rates and the collapse of humanity there's nothing
33:17
Beyond I deny our interest in other as we know it yes beyond that are
33:23
we concerned about any any Fallout now one of the things that I'm thinking of
33:29
is we used to always talk in terms of the split between the genders was
33:34
different than say segregation with race or ethnicity because men and women couldn't really separate to the degree
33:41
that different races could because they had to come together and get married and make families but they can just
33:47
increasingly operate in two different spheres that could accelerate this split
The Gender Split
33:54
so it's interesting to think about like what does the the internet do here when these some of these figures about the
34:00
gender split were being talked about you had some people weighing in and saying well this just shows that the internet
34:07
has separated men and women so completely that they don't even interact with each other anymore and then someone
34:12
else said well actually it's not quite that it's that the internet separates men and women into these virtual spaces
34:19
but the virtual spaces are transparent to each other so the women can see what
34:25
the men are talking about and are talking exactly and that's in way
34:30
the worst of Worlds the Sexes are separating but they're watching each other separate they aren't liking what
34:37
they see because that's you there's no women reason women would like what they see in all male spaces right and so
34:45
that's that's I don't know we've gotten a look inside the locker room is what you're telling there is this kind of an
34:50
you know we said we weren't going to talk about Taylor and and I always forget the the football player's name um
34:55
because you know Travis yeah I think that there's also this weird normaly gap
35:00
between like what women are into and what men are into I like I just like I mean think about it like women are like
35:07
on Pinterest and like men are on Discord you know like Pinterest is like I don't know what Discord is well I I definitely
35:13
know what Discord is but I'm an unusual unusual woman but I think like you know Ross wrote a column about just how
35:19
freaking weird the like bizarre conspiracy theories about Taylor and
35:25
Travis are you know here you have this absolutely beautiful young woman
35:30
doing exactly what we historically have wanted young women to do which is like date a super hot athlete you know very
35:37
manly very manly and like they seem super into each other they're making out all the time and like the right is going
35:44
apeshit I mean they're just like this is a sigh up you know and so and like I guess I just like I think that like to
35:50
me that and this maybe takes it a step away from what Ross was arguing it just sort of like highlights just how
35:55
freaking weird the right in general has become and so it's like if it's like Pinterest versus Discord sign me up for
36:02
Pinterest that's not really gender so much it's just freaky paranoia right though like margorie Taylor green was a
36:09
fan of Q for a while I have some thoughts on the weirdness the weirdness of the left that I will save for a
Spiritual Incel Dum
36:15
future a future conversation but since I wrote it I agree that part of the right
36:21
especially the male right has gotten trapped in what you might call a kind of
36:26
spiritual incel Dum where you are so obsessed with the pery of women in
36:33
becoming liberal and feminist and so on that when one of the not one of the most
36:39
famous wom in the world is sort of doing the most heteronormative thing imaginable you're like oh this has got
36:46
to be fake they you know it's they're they're pulling the wool over our eyes again sure she loves that football
36:52
player who could possibly believe that it's a problem Mrs Al brought us back to Russ LMBO femin feminis it's all a big
37:00
circle but I also think that and this is you know Russ invoked the I word incel and like I think that that's an
37:05
important part of this whole conversation this like there are men out there who think that they have the right
37:11
to like date the most attractive woman in the world they think that Taylor Swift should somehow be in their league
37:17
and like that that I just we had a series of like horrible mass shootings by men who were like no one will have
37:24
sex with me and I I I just I feel like something very rotten very we have to take away from this it's all about sex
37:31
it all comes back to sex well well yes because that is how the human race
37:37
continues to exist and I would just like to point out that it is characteristic
37:42
that like you know I basically describe to you both the looming Apocalypse of
37:48
the developed world and at the end of the show we were like okay fine but you know what does it mean for partisan politics in the US there's only so much
37:56
we can worry about the birth rate this month R you're doing your part God bless you
38:03
um when the Bears roam through the empty Canyons of New York City I'll be long
38:09
gone you remember this conversation and left no airs we're going to leave it there for this week with bears roaming
38:15
Manhattan and when we come back we're going to get hot or [Music]
38:25
cold
Who Has The Take
38:30
[Music] all right we are back and my friends it
38:36
is hot cold time so who has the take this week I do and I I wanted something
38:41
in keeping with our discussion of marriage family formation and birth rates um and obviously I am I am hot
38:50
on marriage Family and Child rearing in general you know saving civilization and
38:56
so on but but what I am cold on at this time of year every year is uh the fact
39:01
that through the workings of Divine Providence three of my beloved children have birthdays within N9 days of one
39:08
another o every year ouch so we we call this birthday alley one is down two to
39:15
go although by that I just mean the sort of handing out of presents and Cake
39:21
blowing out the idea of like birthday sleepovers and birthday parties those
39:26
are still floating around us as they do every year people ask us sometimes if
39:33
you know did we did we plan it this way for Simplicity and the the answer is no
39:38
um how would that be simpler my recommendation is if you if you are you know if you the kind of person who
39:44
somehow manages to plan your childbearing incredibly efficiently space the
39:50
birthday space the birthday you know you could be more efficient and just have one big party now now they would be
39:57
talking about that to their therapist forever but it would be more efficient if I speaking of like the decline of
40:03
patriarchal Authority if I were in charge right if I were running things
40:08
yeah there would be one joint party they'd each get a a present you know but my my soft-hearted wife you know it's
40:16
like oh they all they all need their own they all deserve their special special day everybody gets a trophy I mean what
40:23
is a birthday if not the participation trophy [Laughter]
