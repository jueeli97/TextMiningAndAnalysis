Has Biden Become as Bad as Trump?


what happened to what happened to Carlos I thought I didn't realize he was he was abandoning you didn't know either I just
0:06
texted him where the hell are you got a little got a little crisis of the American Republic
0:12
here from New York Times opinion I'm Ross doit I'm Michelle coddle I'm Lydia
0:18
pgreen and this is matter of [Music]
0:28
opinion so it's great to be back with both of you guys though sadly Carlos
0:33
isn't with us this week he is on vacation so we don't quite have the full gang back together but honestly I think
0:40
that's okay cuz it's pretty slow news week guys nothing going on no n I'm honestly not sure what we should talk
0:47
about are you guys I've been taking care of a baby has anything happened in the last week or so that's piqued your
0:52
interest elections in New Zealand maybe it feels like we're all taking care of a baby and that baby is American democracy
1:01
stop stop it's that the baby's got colic or something I thought you were going to
1:06
say and that baby is President Joe Biden but but you did no but you were even it was even better all right so let's be
1:14
serious um today we're going to try and get a handle on what is actually going
1:19
on with American democracy the Democratic party and the effort to force or at least desperately but gently prod
1:28
Joe Biden out of the presal race gentle a gentle nudge and maybe we can get into
1:34
what this moment tells us about the strength of political parties but really
1:40
there's only one place to start which is asking both of you what the hell excuse me should the Democratic party do about
1:48
its Presidential nominee so talking with folks around the
1:56
party I think that there is a widespread sense that some Tipping Point has been
2:03
reached but the actual Logistics are really problematic so let me stipulate
2:10
we are recording this on the morning of Thursday July 11th which means that we
2:16
are for people following the timeline searching for The Tipping Point we are speaking to you after the George Clooney
2:23
oped both calling for Joe Biden to drop out and Reporting most crucially that at
2:29
the major fundraiser that Clooney himself helped organize for Biden a few weeks ago he was basically just as bad
2:36
as he was at the presidential debate we are speaking to you before Joe Biden's
2:42
NATO press conference so apologies if something even more dramatic you know if
2:50
the Tipping Point has tipped further but that's where we are right now all right let's be clear the Biden people had been
2:55
pitching kind of a triple crown of proof that he could function one was going to
3:01
be the rally in Wisconsin last week the second was going to be the sitdown with George Stephanopoulos and the third was
3:08
going to be this what they're calling a big boy press conference for NATO and
3:14
the reality is there's nothing that these proof of life things were going to prove unless something really horrible
3:20
happened there's just a way to buy time while everybody tries to figure out what the hell is going on and what to do yeah
3:27
I mean I I can't claim to be having conversations with them Democratic insiders this is not my world um but I
3:33
think that the just overall sense of total panic and disarray and honestly I
3:40
think even if one does talk to people on the quote unquote inside of this I'm not at all convinced that there is anything
3:46
to be known I've always believed in aam's Razer which is that the simplest explanation is the most likely and I
3:53
think that the most likely explanation is is that nobody really knows how to make this situation go away and I think
3:59
the problem in part is that there is no good outcome there is no path forward without massive risk and uncertainty and
4:07
that just makes it all the more unclear but those are two distinct statements right like clearly there's no path
4:14
forward without massive risk and uncertainty but the reality is that before the grand unveiling of the first
4:21
presidential debate Joe Biden was not winning this election Joe Biden was losing this election indeed before there
4:28
was the triple crowd of the the proof of Life tour you know
4:34
the Biden team unfathomably sorry I added a Sy I added
4:42
a syllable to unfathomably because it was so unfathomable in hindsight regarded the first presidential debate
4:49
as a really good chance to shake up the race and help it did and it did right and helped Joe Biden regain ground which
4:56
he seemingly did not but so from the point of VI the Democrats I mean there
5:01
is upside potentially in fact there is a potential good outcome here for the
5:07
Democrats we don't know exactly what it is but there is an outcome with a different candidate who plls better than
5:12
Joe Biden that is a possible outcome it is possible outcome but the odds of that
5:18
candidate going on to win in the general getting them in position and time without destroying party unity and
5:24
having everybody just like in kind of ongoing turmoil
5:30
those are some pretty like long odds I mean look I guess I'm a little bit less
5:35
pessimistic about the ability to identify and run a new candidate if that were to be necessary it seems pretty
5:43
clear that that is that is now necessary there is time like let's not forget and
5:48
obviously we have very different political systems you know we just saw two of our most important allies France
5:54
and the United Kingdom um very quickly do uh campaigns for for general elections and produced Big seismic
6:01
results that I think were very interesting and told us a lot about these places again we're a very different political system I understand
6:07
that and our political parties aren't really set up to to work in that way but um boy it certainly seems worth trying
6:14
there's a lot of talent in the Democratic party and you know we can talk about specific candidates I was with KL Harris in Dallas yesterday and
6:20
happy to talk about about that but um no I don't think it's too late I don't think that this is hopeless or lost at
6:26
all Donald Trump is a very very very bad and weak candidate so I just think that
6:32
you know having an effective candidate who can actually like prosecute this election tipping my hand a little bit
6:38
there would leave us in a very different place than we are right now I think one of the things that's making Democrats
6:43
nervous though is that you know up until very recently kamla was pulling worse than Biden and even now she is as I
6:52
understand it looking a little better but they still don't see her as a good bet in swing States I mean kamla has a
7:00
long way to go to make anybody feel comfortable now that said I think you're
7:05
absolutely right I think something has to be done and the general consensus right now is that kamla is if not the
7:13
only viable option at least overwhelmingly the most likely option uh
7:21
but that doesn't make any option great well so let's talk for a minute more about what is to be done right because
7:29
we've had this kind of whipsaw just in the last few days of you know moments when people were saying oh the dam is
7:35
breaking you know just like the walls were closing in was the watchword of Trump's first term every week the walls
7:41
were closing in now it's the dam is breaking and then you know we love our infrastructure maybe we it's
7:47
infrastructure week infastructure and maybe it doesn't right but you have a day where you know a bunch of Democrats
7:55
say things about how they're losing confidence in Biden the media is sort of Full Tilt against him I would say at
8:02
this point and people say oh you know this is unsustainable but then the next day a bunch of democratic politicians
8:08
say we're sticking with Joe and you know the Biden White House puts out a letter a long letter a detailed letter saying
8:16
we're not going anywhere and everyone says oh I guess I guess they're going to stick with Biden and then Nancy Pelosi
8:22
goes on Morning Joe and says we're really just waiting for the president to make a decision and everyone says ah
8:28
well that means she wants him to change his decision and so the situation is highly fluid the situation is highly
8:34
fluid but so but let's try and make it concrete what actually has to happen for
8:41
Joe Biden to step aside is it just about what's happening in his own mind and his
8:47
inner circle is there a kind of Pelosi Obama Clooney Tipping Point
8:55
where Schumer right where where you know the sort of rep repan wise men going to
9:00
Richard Nixon and telling him it's over kind of moment so if you talk to some of the folks who are like on the kind of in
9:06
the midst of this the talk is of collective action you need some kind of like group show of it's time Dad give me
9:15
the keys but then you are also dealing with a President Who for all his kind
9:21
of genial avuncular Papa sweetness also has a real defiant streak and gets his
9:29
back up and that seems to have been what has happened with the family in general you know like we hear Talk of the first
9:35
lady being like no you're going to get in there and fight all the way Hunter showing up at the White House don't
9:41
forget yeah Chief of Staff Hunter Biden this is like he's there man a bunker mentality for the ages it's like they
9:47
sat down and they're like what could we do to make this look even worse than it
9:52
already oh let's bring in Hunter great idea so you've got this defiant bunker
9:57
mentality going on and most people at this point think that there is not a gentle way to get him to go that it it's
10:05
going to take a bit of ugliness I mean I one of you know we've already invoked
10:11
George Clooney so I feel like we can talk about Hollywood and I think that uh one of the challenges here uh both for
10:17
Democrats themselves and and I think sort of the broader kind of democratic voting population is this kind of weird
10:25
split screen view that we have of politics and I think of it as sort of we have this this habit of either
10:31
idealizing it all of the West Wing right or being totally cynical about it all of Veep right it's either one or the other
10:38
and I do think that you know we kind of need to get ourselves out of Hollywood fantasy world and think about I don't
10:45
know just brass taxs practical how do we move this forward here um and I don't
10:51
know who the grown-ups are that are that are having that conversation and aren't indulging in the kind of um you know
10:57
fantasy or cynicism well one of the Practical things they are looking at is they are looking quite
11:04
intently at how this is going to affect down ballot races again back to the idea that a lot of these folks seem to have
11:10
just thrown up their hands and given up on the presidency so then the question is not that you're necessarily having
11:17
them lose but if they lose is it better to lose with Biden and what will that do
11:23
to is that going to take down Senate races house races all these down ballot races and they are sitting around
11:30
crunching numbers to some degree I mean and and the question then is like you know we keep being told this is the most
11:35
important election in American history and the stakes are life or death and all of these kinds of things why isn't
11:41
anyone acting like it I mean that that's my question possibly because they didn't
11:46
actually believe it for instance our colleague Ezra Klein uh stirred up a lot
11:53
of strong responses on social media when he went on a uh the bull Works podcast
11:58
and said he was talking talking to Democrats who said look I don't actually think Donald Trump is an existential
12:04
threat to American democracy and so that's why I'm not as worried about this as some people are clearly there are
12:10
Democrats who do not take the view that a second Trump term is going to end
12:16
democracy correctly in my view but not that's obviously not the line that the Democratic party has officially taken
12:23
but let's take a quick break and we'll be right back
12:29
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
12:45
I want to get back to Michelle you talked about sort of ugliness right and directness let's say we get to the point
12:53
where through private intervention or public intervention everybody knows that
12:58
Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama not just his stalking horse George
13:03
Clooney who I keep bringing up but Barack Obama Barack Obama himself all think Joe Biden has to go but Joe Biden
13:11
says guys guess what I just looked at the latest poll from The Washington Post
13:17
which I'm staring at conveniently right now it shows me in a statistical tie with Donald Trump even after that bad
13:24
debate uh I why why should I step aside I don't care what you say I won the
13:29
primaries you're trying to thwart the will of the voters um what happens then I mean it depends on how public they're
13:36
willing to get like Barack Obama comes out they get completely public Barack Obama says it's done Joe I mean I think
13:42
the the the thing to remember is that in the 2020 election Bernie Sanders was
13:48
mounting this kind of insurgent campaign and you know people were excited about him and you know like there was a lot of
13:54
there was just a lot of excitement about Bernie Bernie was great right love the guy love the guy um you know
14:00
would have won no I know you do I know you I know you're not being not you're not being sarcastic I I believe you I
14:06
believe you but what's interesting is that the Democratic party was able to
14:11
essentially create an outcome that was desired by party Elites right which was that Joe Biden would be the nominee well
14:18
let's be clear though it wasn't just the idea that this was like party Elites versus the base is only if you're
14:25
looking at the activist young Progressive base it's not you're looking at the heart of the democratic party
14:31
which is older black voters Who Loved Joe Biden and that's who could cost you if like you have Obama and folks say
14:38
it's time and that base is well represented in the thinking and
14:44
personalities of Democratic party Elites right and so they were able to um create
14:50
the outcome that they felt would most likely lead to Victory and it turns out that they were right Joe Biden did win
14:56
you know we could talk about counterfactuals in which a different candidate might have won you know who knows but they were able to make that
15:03
happen in 2020 right despite the fact that Joe Biden did not necessarily seem destined to win the primary and I think
15:10
the the difference now is that we're dealing with an incumbent President right and that creates a a different
15:15
situation but I don't know that it creates the the same kind of situation
15:20
the kind of Hostage taking that uh you're seeing in the Republican party
15:26
where there really just isn't any option if you want to in the Republican Party other than to be loyal to Donald Trump
15:33
so I think there is a clear difference there in that at the various points when
15:40
the Republican party as a party could have moved against Trump whether in the
15:45
primary or after the Access Hollywood tape came out when some people were
15:50
coming out and saying Trump should drop out and Mike Pence should be our nominee in both of those circumstances there was
15:56
a big faction in the Republican party not a majority at that point that saw Trump as the only guy who could deliver
16:03
something that they wanted and for some of them it was fighting the libs for some of them it was trade policy and
16:08
immigration and protectionism and so on and that doesn't seem to exist with Biden now there are people who like Joe
16:15
Biden there's some kind of Joe Biden base but I don't think anybody is waking up in the morning and saying only with
16:21
Joe Biden can I have the Democratic party that I want so that definitely is
16:27
a strength that Trump had had in resisting party attempts to move against him that Biden doesn't have and I agree
16:33
that the the maneuverings in that primary were evidence that the Democratic party is a more functional
16:39
party than the Republicans I think that certainly was true then probably still true now I'm just trying to get you guys
16:47
to respond to what I think is the reasonable response to my argument which is again how do you get him to go if he
16:56
doesn't if he just says no it's not entirely clear to me what you're asking
17:02
are you asking who is going to take to the convention floor and like I don't
17:07
understand what you're asking in terms of like if it's going to be a fight at the convention obviously you would have
17:13
to have party Elders who had had these discussions but I'm not sure exactly beyond that what you're asking are you
17:20
asking what need to be pulled or who's going to pull them I know we don't we don't need to LEAP all the way ahead to
17:26
the convention I guess what I'm trying to discern is two days ago a lot of people not me but
17:33
a lot of people were saying guess what it's over Biden staying in the Democrats are just going to reconcile themselves
17:40
to it and so at this moment Thursday morning it seems much more likely that he will be pushed out I'm trying to
17:46
discern if there's a world where the pendulum just has to swing back where Biden says I'm not going people look
17:53
around and say Well we'd have to mount a rival candidate at the convention that seems unimaginable
17:59
and so people just sort of tiptoe away from the statements they've made in the last week or so and we just continue
18:06
with Biden as a nominee that's what they're hoping they're hoping that they can make it look as painful and
18:12
difficult as possible to move forward with any alternatives that's the message that they're putting out there they they
18:18
want to stop defections they are desperate for people in the Senate and House and other party eminences not to
18:25
come forward like you know last night we saw Vermont's Peter Welch become the
18:31
first Democratic senator to actually call for Biden to drop out of the race
18:37
truly truly a household name they want Senator Peter Welch they are concerned
18:42
as you noted earlier that something like that is going to break the dam and it's going to come out so it's just too fluid
18:49
to know to me this has been the core of the case for kamla Harris is that you
18:55
know you get sort of a number of things at the same time it's been absolutely excruciatingly annoying to me for people
19:01
to argue that like if you pass her over you're going to lose black voters and that's why she needs to be picked or
19:07
it's quote unquote her turn that's why she needs to be picked that's just utter horeshit like none of those actually
19:13
hold any weight at all to me I think one of the most foundational reasons that KLA Harris is the choice is that
19:20
precisely the problem that Ross is talking about you need to create a bridge to a dignified end of this for
19:27
Joe Biden and whatever internally you know people may think about KL Harris's
19:33
electability and things like that I I will argue that case as well but I think it's really important to remember that
19:39
she is the vice president he chose her to be his successor if he were unable to
19:44
continue serving there is a way to tell the story of his you know magnanimously
19:50
and nobly stepping aside after a single even after all of this it will be forgotten his his recalcitrant will be
19:57
forgiven and folded into a long history of bullheadedness but I think to me that
20:03
is one of the most important and fundamental aspects of the kamla Harris situation that makes it the most likely
20:10
and cleanest way to get out of this mess on that note appreciated by all kamla
20:16
Harris fans throughout this fine land we're going to take a short break and when we come back we're going to talk a
20:22
little bit bigger picture about what the situation tells us about the role of
20:27
political parties in American democracy right now so stay with [Music]
20:53
us and we're back so we touched a couple times earlier on the parallels and non-p
21:00
parallels between this situation and the situation that Republicans found themselves in in 2016 with Donald Trump
21:09
a different form of unfitness for the presidency let's say but a similar
21:16
situation in that you had a either near nominee or eventual nominee who a lot of
21:23
party actors really wanted to get rid of and couldn't figure out how to do it and
21:28
I'm interested in what this says about the nature of political parties I'm but I'm also curious for both of you my more
21:35
liberal friends whether going through the last couple weeks as a you know as a
21:40
liberal American has given you any more Sympathy For What Republicans went
21:48
through and how they ended up with Donald Trump as their nominee absolutely
21:53
not I mean I I I just think that the the no abs absolutely not look the
22:00
Democratic party has a long tradition of policing the parameters of acceptable
22:05
candidates right and of having a leadership that represents the for
22:11
better or worse I think the kind of the center of where the party is at and we've ended up with these I mean
22:18
certainly since the victory of Barack Obama which I think was genuinely a surprise that built in in the 2008
22:24
primary I think that there has For Better or Worse been a very carefully choreographed process that ended
22:31
disastrously in 2016 with Hillary Clinton's defeat it ended triumphantly in 2020 with with Joe Biden winning the
22:39
presidency and I just think that it's a tough comparison to make because again
22:44
we're dealing with an incumbent president who is currently in office and that was always going to be a very hard
22:49
thing to maneuver somebody in that position out um Donald Trump why would
22:55
anybody think that this man should have been president he was a reality television star and a failed businessman
23:00
you know like he was a Carnival Barker and and somebody who just had really no
23:06
institutional story to tell about why he should be in power right and so I just
23:12
don't think that there's any parallel there really at all Michelle do you have any thoughts
23:18
before I try and offer a couple oh I just I'm so eager for those thoughts but I mean I do think that you you really
23:26
can't compare rooting out as sitting president and dealing with an Open Primary the structures of American
23:32
politics often come up around a sitting president and then you have to unwind
23:38
all of that if your own party is trying to make a change in the primary it's a
23:44
really kind of complicated situation as opposed to yeah right I mean unlike the
23:51
Republic let's say the Republican position after the Access Hollywood tape dropped right when there was a at that
23:58
point it's true Donald Trump was not the president of the United States however he was the nominee of the party against
24:05
the desire of many party actors who had tried and failed to mobilize along the
24:11
lines that Lydia describes against him to get another nominee I think there's
24:16
been an assumption among a lot of liberals and Democrats that the lesson of Trump's
24:23
Ascent was that the Republicans who sort of tried to stop it and sort of gave up
24:29
and went along with the party proved themselves to be bad people when they did that unfortunately the Democratic
24:35
party is full of good people and good people would find a way to stop an unfit
24:40
president whereas the bad people in the Republican party did not and that's what
24:46
I'm I'm not saying you guys think that per se obviously you both you know know and like some Republicans um
24:54
but I feel like at least some Democrats might be rethinking that perspective
25:01
slightly as they themselves recognize that in fact when you have someone who
25:07
won a primary election who is unfit for the presidency it's not an easy thing to
25:13
figure out how to get him out and you do get a lot of people and clearly a lot of
25:21
Democrats would accept a path of lease resistance right now not all of them but there are a lot of democratic office
25:27
holders like Alexandro Casio Cortez came out and said Biden's the nominee let's stop talking about it right like but
25:35
that may that may have been tactical right I mean there's always a plan trust trust the plan well I don't I mean
25:41
listen I feel like we're you know the the phrase blue and on is uh has crept into the Lexicon in a way yeah blue Maga
25:48
is also a thing but like look but there's a thing for a reason right which is that people feel a strong loyalty to
25:55
their parties and their leaders and it's hard to get rid of them no no no hold on hold on hold on hold on it's it's a thing on Twitter right what happened in
26:03
2016 is that Donald Trump in a competitive primary right like was the
26:10
was the nominee of the party right like the difference of 2024 is that we have an incumbent Democratic president and
26:16
there was not a a competitive primary right I mean why was why was that Lydia
26:21
I mean because I think tradition come on you're not going to pretend that a re-election campaign is a choice as
26:27
opposed to a COR in every single case why wasn't there why wasn't there
26:34
primary against Donald Trump C because it's really hard to get rid of
26:40
a incumbent or in Trump's case a a near incumbent I guess I'm curious in that it
26:47
does seem like there were a number of Democrats who were aware of the problem
26:52
that has been made manifest in the last month and tried to point it out led by my hero representative Dean Phillips um
27:00
future Statesman I you know we laugh but it's Dean Phillips was right and other
27:06
people were right people have been pointing out this problem that Joe Biden has where he is manifestly too old to be
27:12
president okay it hasn't let's say it hasn't been apparent for his entire presidency but it has become
27:17
increasingly apparent and many people have pointed it out and lots of people in the Democratic party have been in denial about it right and again we get
27:26
back to the question of you know lots of people thought there were problems with Reagan as he was running for re-election
27:31
and there were moments in his debate where he froze where he absolutely humiliated himself and then he came back
27:39
in the next debate and proved himself now I do not think that's what's happening here with Joe Biden but I do
27:45
think a lot of Democrats until this meltdown could tell themselves that
27:50
people were overreacting a lot of people were not seeing this and we have no real
27:57
I mean part of what's got people so upset is there is a question of how much and how many people knew this was a
28:04
problem and to what degree and until you have it shoved in your face George cludy knew Georgey knew I mean listen I think
28:13
that that it's worth thinking for a minute about like what just happened and I know I'm always the person who's bringing up the international examples
28:19
it's worth thinking about what just happened in France right in the French election in the second round which a
28:24
friend of mine called a kind of a two-factor verification for for uh for democracy which you know might not be
28:30
such a bad idea something we could think about but what I took away from that election was that in you know that the
28:35
political parties that did not want the farri to come to power um felt that they were in a truly break glass situation
28:43
and the left in the center came together in a what will be a messy uh and not even really an an alliance but you know
28:51
they blocked it because it really was a break class situation that people didn't want to see happen and and to me the
28:57
question for the Democratic party is what coalitions are you willing to make and what glass are you willing to break
29:03
in order to ensure that Donald Trump does not become president again and if
29:09
you truly deeply believe that Joe Biden cannot win this then you cannot in good
29:14
conscience be standing there saying that you know well it's up to him to decide that that that's just not an acceptable answer to the question so I guess like I
29:21
don't entirely disagree with you Ross I mean I think that there is you know there's always going to be cynicism there's always going to be calcul you
29:28
have so many people who want to be president that's just the nature of politics but to me the fundamental question is is this a break glass
29:34
situation or is it not and can you rise above those Petty self-interests in order to do the thing that you have been
29:41
telling us is the most important thing to do which is to defeat Donald Trump and one of the things it looks like you're thinking about Ross is the
29:47
parties are weak compared to historically they they feel like they're
29:52
everywhere and they have certain roles that they play especially kind of organizing voting in the states but they
29:59
are completely kind of stripped from what they used to be I mean in part because the money is not relying on the
30:06
parties anymore you have a different funding mechanism and politics runs a lot on money so you don't have the
30:12
gatekeeping that you used to have in terms of as Lydia talks about policing
30:17
the parameters right and that I have a number of follow-up questions about the
30:24
morality of how Democrats have proceeded up till now with Joe B but I think we'll have a chance to talk about them more it
30:31
seems like in both of your arguments there's basically a case that the
30:36
political parties are in a way too small D Democratic right that it would have
30:43
been a better world if Republican Elites had had a mechanism to veto a candidate
30:49
in 2016 who was only getting 30 35% of the vote and now it would be it is the
30:56
world that both of you want and are confident we will get that party Elders
31:01
can just sort of step in and figure out a mechanism to replace the man who won
31:07
all the primaries right so we stronger parties is are you approaching the Joe Biden
31:14
Elite versus voter thing because that's an episode that's an entire episode in
31:19
an entire the idea that the voters have not been expressing this is a fantasy
31:26
that the Biden folks I guess my my point is just that there is no I mean apart
31:31
from actual fantasies about running like a lightning round primary there is no
31:36
mechanism now there is no mechanism now where the will of the Democratic primary
31:42
electorate is going to be expressed in the choice of nominee I mean I think that you know the future that I would
31:48
want is actually a much more competitive and small D Democratic party and and Republican party for that matter but you
31:53
know I think we had a very very Democratic Republican party that clearly and resoundingly voted for Donald Trump
32:00
in 2016 to be the nominee and and now again has voted for him to be the nominee in in 2024 so you know there's
32:07
there's no question that democracy on its own can produce outcomes that many
32:13
many people will find deeply unsettling and uncomfortable right and so maybe we need something a little bit like our
32:19
Constitution which is a uh some way to temper the will of the majority with the
32:25
wisdom of the ages that is beautiful oh that is such beautiful St all right well on that note I think
32:33
that you know there will be a lot more to say about all these issues we've solved it we've done we're done when we
32:39
reconvene so I'm going to go have my heart tohe heart with the president and then we're going to be all done that's right we're that's what we're doing we
32:45
are sending Lydia and Michelle I I should say that you know Biden is famous for saying he doesn't you know none of
32:52
the pundits believed in him and so on I was actually the author of The Biden
32:57
Endor ment when everyone was asked to pick a Democratic primary candidate from
33:03
the stable of New York Times opinion writers back in 2020 I wrote the piece saying the Democrats should nominate Joe
33:09
Biden so I feel that I'm actually well positioned to go have the heart tohe heart that the president needs our man
33:16
on the inside Ross do that's right good luck Ross all right guys great talking to you and we will talk again very very
