Who Should Lead the Democratic Ticket? Six Columnists Weigh In.

0:02
hey there matter of opinion listeners
0:04
it's Ross the matter of opinion gang is
0:06
taking a break from our regular
0:08
programming this week to celebrate the
0:10
4th of July but we didn't want to leave
0:12
you in the dark during this chaotic
0:15
fascinating wild moment of the
0:17
presidential race as the pressure on Joe
0:19
Biden to drop out heats up for now Joe
0:23
Biden is still in the race but with his
0:24
candidacy very much in question some of
0:27
my colleagues and I picked who we'd like
0:29
to see run as the Democratic nominee and
0:32
you may hear some familiar voices making
0:34
their
0:35
[Music]
0:40
picks I'm Lydia pgreen opinion columnist
Lydia Green New York Times
0:43
from The New York Times Like many of my
0:45
colleagues I think it's time for Joe
0:47
Biden to bow out and I believe that the
0:50
best person to replace him is kamla
0:55
Harris you know KLA Harris she didn't
0:57
make it that far in the primaries and
1:00
that might make you think this is
1:02
someone who has tried and failed to
1:03
become president why would she be good
1:04
on the national stage but I think it's
1:07
important to remember that running in a
1:08
primary and running for the general
1:09
election are actually two very different
1:14
[Music]
1:15
things in a primary you're essentially
1:18
running against your peers in many cases
1:21
your fellow politicians from your party
1:24
and you're arguing with them over
1:25
smaller differences than the big
1:27
differences that separate our politics I
1:30
in this very polarized time and where
1:33
gender and race actually play a huge
1:35
role in terms of how people are
1:37
perceived and where you know the showing
1:40
of emotion or anger or other feelings um
1:45
play very differently depending on
1:46
whether you're a woman depending on
1:48
whether you're a person of color um that
1:51
primary environment I think is actually
1:52
quite complicated um those same Dynamics
1:55
can be at play in a general election um
1:57
as well but they're actually much
2:00
different in this particular general
2:02
election right because Donald Trump is a
2:04
very particular kind of
2:08
politician I think one of the things
2:10
that makes kamla Harris really
2:11
compelling in this environment is that
2:13
we're dealing with a bully and she is a
2:16
person who I think does very well in
2:19
going up against bullies she has a
2:21
demeanor she has a way of speaking that
2:23
I think very much comes from her
2:25
experience as a prosecutor that I think
2:27
plays very well when dealing with
2:28
someone who um who really is kind of
2:30
outside the bounds of the
2:32
law one of the things that was most
2:34
troubling about the debate between Biden
2:36
and Trump was that unsurprisingly Trump
2:40
just spouted lie after lie after lie and
2:44
the thing that was so devastating was
2:46
that Joe Biden just seemed completely
2:48
unable to counter those lies and it's
2:51
just impossible to imagine that kamla
2:53
Harris you know who is really a very
2:55
successful debater wouldn't be able to
2:57
just methodically come in and count
3:00
point for point every single thing that
3:02
came out of Donald Trump's
3:10
mouth the Biden Administration has put
3:12
kamla Harris front and center on the
3:14
messaging about abortion rights and
3:16
rightfully so everyone knows that Joe
3:19
Biden is not a great Messenger on this
3:20
issue he has had a long history of
3:23
ambivalence about Choice he is a devout
3:26
Catholic and I think it's fair to say he
3:29
does not feel particular ularly
3:30
comfortable speaking in um strident
3:32
terms about uh women's right to choose
3:35
that is not a problem for KLA Harris she
3:37
is a lifelong believer and Fighter for
3:40
this cause and I think would be an
3:42
eloquent and Powerful spokesperson for
3:45
the issue as the nominee just as she has
3:47
been on the campaign Trail as part of
3:49
the
3:52
ticket I think there are really two
3:54
separate questions we need to ask
3:55
ourselves one question is would Harris
3:58
be a good nominee I feel based on what
4:01
we've seen in the past week that
4:03
actually she can make a pretty
4:04
compelling case for herself as a strong
4:07
candidate I think there there's another
4:09
question um which is you know would she
4:11
make a good president and in an abstract
4:14
world where we weren't weighing her
4:16
against Donald Trump I think that's an
4:17
interesting conversation to have one of
4:19
the criticisms of her when she was a
4:21
primary candidate was that there wasn't
4:24
a clear and compelling reason that she
4:26
could give for why she should be present
4:28
what was her vision and I don't think
4:30
that she solved that problem but I think
4:32
it's important to remember that
4:34
circumstances dictate who the right
4:35
person is at any given time right and
4:38
what is the need of the hour the need of
4:40
the hour is to somehow find a way to
4:43
ease Joe Biden out of the presidency
4:46
somehow find somebody to take on Donald
4:49
Trump and so for me the case for KLA
4:52
Harris is that she is the right person
4:55
for that first part of the job which is
4:57
frankly the most important part of the
4:59
job
5:02
this is an existential crisis we cannot
5:04
survive another Trump Administration
5:07
preventing Trump from winning the
5:08
presidency I think has to be the
5:10
Paramount goal I'm not saying that I
5:12
don't think that the kamla Harris
5:13
wouldn't be a good president she might
5:15
very well be a great president I have no
5:17
idea but I don't think that that's a
5:19
question that we frankly have the luxury
5:21
to ask right now because we know that
5:23
Donald Trump would be a catastrophic
5:27
president in order to have a vacancy in
5:30
order to have an opportunity to run
5:33
another candidate President Biden has to
5:36
decide not to run and that ultimately is
5:38
his decision to make and it's going to
5:39
be an excruciating and very hard
5:41
decision and to me part of the reason
5:44
that anointing kamla Harris who is his
5:47
vice president is an easier thing to do
5:50
than simply throwing it open to a for
5:53
example brokered
5:55
convention is that this is a natural
5:57
order of things you know you choose a
5:59
the vice president because you might not
6:02
live through your entire term that's
6:04
true of any
6:05
president and so I think it would be
6:08
easier and less damaging for the party
6:11
for President Biden to Simply say you
6:14
know what I think my time is up it's
6:16
time for me to pass the Baton to the
6:18
person you the voters voted into office
6:22
as part of my Administration to carry us
6:25
forward

[Music]
Nicholas Kristoff New York Times
6:39
I'm Nicholas Kristoff and I'm here with
6:41
the case for Gretchen Whitmer the
6:43
governor of
6:44
[Music]
6:46
Michigan I'm rooting for Whitmer because
6:49
the job at the nominee and especially at
6:52
a time when the stakes are so high When
6:54
Donald Trump is the opposition the job
6:56
of the nominee is to win
6:59
I do think that Governor Whitmer is
7:01
particularly well-placed to get votes in
7:04
the handful of states that are in
7:07
play for starters Michigan is an
7:10
absolute must-win State for the
7:12
Democrats and Whitmer has won it handily
7:15
in both her races for governor that
7:17
suggests that she will also do well in
7:19
nearby States like Wisconsin and
7:21
Pennsylvania and I think her pragmatism
7:24
will also play well with centrists in
7:27
States like Arizona and Georgia
7:30
I think a Michigan Governor is well
7:34
positioned to ride the anti-incumbent
7:36
anti- elest mood that we see among
7:39
voters uh in the US and also just to
7:42
generate excitement as a fresh face on
7:44
the national scene somebody from a new
7:46
generation and boy I would just relish
7:49
seeing how a dynamic younger candidate
7:53
can force Trump on his heels and make
7:55
him defend himself as the old guy with
7:58
the dubious Al Acuity left in the
8:01
[Music]
8:04
race I've been following Whitmer ever
8:06
since she was a state senator and in
8:08
2013 gave just an extraordinary speech
8:11
for abortion rights that put her on the
8:14
national map I Rise for my no vote
8:18
explanation as the Republican male
8:20
majority continues to ignorantly and
8:23
unnecessarily weigh in on important
8:26
women's health issues that they know
8:28
nothing
8:30
about toward the end of that speech she
8:33
put down her notes and disclosed
8:35
something that she had hidden from most
8:37
people that was intensely personal but
8:39
over 20 years ago I was a victim of
8:42
rape and thank God it didn't result in a
8:46
pregnancy because I can't imagine going
8:50
through what I went through and
8:51
then having to consider what to do about
8:54
an unwanted
8:57
pregnancy from an attacker
8:59
[Music]
9:02
she was emotional raw powerful and
9:07
persuasive and that speech marked her as
9:10
a politician to
9:15
watch look there are lots of
9:17
uncertainties ahead I have no idea what
9:19
whitmer's foreign policy would be but I
9:22
do know that she's a good speaker that
9:24
she has shown she can win over Centrist
9:26
voters and also that she was only one
9:29
year old when Biden was elected to the
9:32
Senate so in my view Gretchen Whitmer is
9:35
the best Biden alternative keep an eye
9:38
on
9:38
[Music]
Ross Douthat NYT
9:47
her I'm Ross doit and I'm a columnist
9:49
for the New York
9:51
Times I'm here to make the case that the
9:54
Democrats should nominate the senator
9:56
from West Virginia Joe mansion
9:59
much of the democratic party and many of
10:01
my friends in the media are convinced
10:03
that this election has almost
10:05
existential Stakes for the United States
10:07
of America and if that is the case there
10:10
is a reasonable argument for the
10:12
Democratic party to nominate someone who
10:15
is as close to the center of American
10:17
politics as you can get with a long
10:19
record of voting for Democratic causes
10:22
so Mansion
10:25
2024 now I've thought Joe Mansion should
10:28
run for president for a while in 2023 I
10:31
made the case that he should run as an
10:34
independent and I thought as a moderate
10:36
Democrat Mansion was well positioned to
10:39
run basically I argue to kind of test
10:42
the waters campaign but the reason to
10:45
think of him as a plausible Third Party
10:47
candidate is also the reason to think of
10:49
him as a plausible nominee for the
10:51
Democrats if their absolute goal is to
10:55
defeat Donald Trump no matter what
11:01
Mansion is a guy who successfully
11:04
managed to get elected to the Senate
11:07
from West Virginia over the course of
11:10
multiple election Cycles where West
11:12
Virginia was being transformed from a
11:15
reliably Democratic State into a
11:17
reliably Republican one and his strategy
11:20
always seemed to be pull a given piece
11:23
of democratic legislation more towards
11:26
the middle or towards the middle as he
11:28
understood it but be willing to vote for
11:30
it when push came to shf he was you know
11:33
more socially conservative in various
11:36
ways on issues ranging from abortion to
11:39
immigration he tended to be more
11:42
skeptical of large spending bills of all
11:46
kinds climate change legislation in
11:48
particular he did a lot of things
11:50
especially in the Biden era that made
11:52
more ideological Democrats incredibly
11:54
frustrated with him at the same time he
11:57
remained a pretty reliable vote for
12:00
Democratic causes and programs and
12:02
judicial nominations and everything else
12:04
so in imagining him as a democratic
12:07
nominee you're picking someone who in a
12:09
different kind of era would have been
12:12
the leader of probably a pretty big
12:14
Centrist faction in the Democratic party
12:17
so nominating him wouldn't require the
12:19
Democratic party to radically shift its
12:22
positions on almost any issue it would
12:25
be a unique signal to the country that
12:29
the Democrats are willing to make major
12:32
ideological compromise which is the kind
12:36
of signal that if you are determined to
12:38
win the election at all costs you want
12:40
to be
12:42
[Music]
12:43
sending I think mansion's biggest
12:45
challenge in the incredibly unlikely
12:48
event that he was the Democratic nominee
12:50
is that because he is a moderate who is
12:53
despised by key activist groups in the
12:56
Democratic Coalition um that most Dem
12:59
rats are just not going to turn out for
13:01
someone who spent the Biden years trying
13:04
to make Joe Biden's agenda more moderate
13:07
and sometimes contributing to derailing
13:10
it you know that's always the problem
13:11
with trying to nominate the most
13:13
moderate candidate you risk alienating
13:16
your own base but I think in this
13:18
scenario given the lateness of the hour
13:22
and Donald Trump as the Republican
13:24
nominee that what you would gain among
13:27
swing voters would outweigh what you
13:29
would lose in the party's base both
13:32
political parties have nominated
13:34
candidates for president who
13:37
are broadly unacceptable to the middle
13:41
30% of Americans and it would probably
13:45
be useful for the country if one of the
13:48
two parties tried to nominate someone
13:50
who was much more acceptable to
13:52
Americans in that middle ground
13:56
[Music]
14:01
I'm Pamela Paul an opinion columnist for
14:04
the New York Times and I'm here to make
14:06
the case for Wes Moore as the Democratic
14:08
candidate for
14:11
president Wes Moore is the first-term
14:13
governor of the state of Maryland so
14:15
relatively inexperienced in politics but
14:18
with a broad range of experience before
14:21
coming to politics he has served in the
14:24
military including serving at war in
14:26
Afghanistan he's worked in the private
14:28
sector in Investment Banking he has
14:31
foreign policy experience and expertise
14:34
and he's published five books including
14:36
books for young
14:40
people so I've been aware of Westmore
14:43
for a long time as the former editor the
14:45
book review as an author and that's how
14:47
I often thought about him and I first
14:50
met him out at Stanford University where
14:53
he was participating in a conference
14:56
about revitalizing American institutions
14:59
s and he and Governor Chris sonunu
15:03
Republican of New
15:04
Hampshire did a panel together in which
15:08
they had a really Lively interesting
15:10
conversation absolutely honored to be
15:12
here and and to be with Wes who I
15:14
consider a great friend he's a great
15:15
governor and the thing that struck me
15:17
most about their conversation is that
15:19
they were friends even though they are
15:21
from very different sides of the
15:24
political Spectrum Chris anunu as the
15:27
more experienced Governor has given
15:30
advice to Westmore and Westmore called
15:32
him his best advisor as a governor when
15:34
I think about who some of the governors
15:37
who have been most helpful to me as I
15:39
made the transition because I'd never
15:40
run for office before I became the
15:42
governor uh and you know people can
15:44
think about oh it's this Governor that
15:46
Governor which political party the
15:48
reality is you've been one of the most
15:49
helpful Governors to me in this
15:51
transition and that's a republican
15:52
Governor I thought that was remarkable
15:54
because as we all know we live in a
15:59
thing that really came out in their
16:00
conversation was that as Governors you
16:03
need to get things done you need to
16:05
balance a budget you cannot just not
16:09
vote you cannot just slide by it's not
16:12
like the Senate and one of the reasons I
16:14
think that Governor Moore is one of the
16:16
best equipped people to assume the
16:18
presidency is that as a governor he has
16:22
better experience than many people who
16:24
have served in Washington for a long
16:26
time
16:29
[Music]
16:31
I think his relative youth could shake
16:33
up a campaign that no one is happy with
16:36
between two geriatric candidates he
16:39
could energize the electorate I think
16:41
that he could win and govern well and he
16:44
could really usher in a new era of
16:46
leadership for Democrats I mean how have
16:49
we gotten into a situation where we have
16:51
an 81-year-old man who's been in
16:53
politics his entire life as being our
16:56
candidate when it's clear that America
16:58
Americans are not happy with how things
17:01
are going and with the current direction
17:03
of this
17:05
country the number one thing people will
17:07
say about Westmore is that he doesn't
17:08
have the experience necessary that it's
17:11
not his time yet but first of all I feel
17:15
very frustrated with the it's his time
17:18
or it's not his time thinking because
17:21
when Biden was running everyone thought
17:23
oh it's his time he deserves it when Bob
17:26
Dole was running oh it's his turn he
17:28
deserves it this is a way to lose a
17:31
campaign this is not about making
17:33
someone feel better this is about what's
17:35
doing right for the country and Westmore
17:38
though he may not have a lot of
17:40
governmental experience he certainly had
17:43
a lot more experience than Donald Trump
17:45
did coming on and in fact I think his
17:48
relative inexperience would work in his
17:50
favor because people are looking for
17:52
someone to bring A New Perspective who
17:55
is not afraid of change who can draw
17:58
from a wide range of experience outside
18:01
of Washington and who's shown that he
18:03
knows how to solve problems and
18:06
[Music]
David French
18:14
Lead I'm David French and I'm here to
18:17
make the case that Josh Piro should
18:19
replace Joe Biden on the top of the
18:21
democratic
18:24
ticket until 2016 I was a republican I'm
18:27
still conservative I'm a conservative in
18:29
the Reagan conservative mold so it is
18:32
very unusual for me to be giving any
18:35
kind of advice to the Democratic party
18:38
however I am of the belief that Donald
18:40
Trump needs to lose in 2024 for the
18:43
health of the country for the health of
18:45
our Constitution and for the health
18:48
honestly of the Republican party and the
18:50
conservative movement and so I want to
18:54
see the best possible Democrat Face
18:57
Donald Trump in 201
19:02
24 Josh airo is the first-term governor
19:05
of Pennsylvania former Attorney General
19:07
of Pennsylvania and before then was a
19:09
member of the State House of
19:11
Pennsylvania I think there are multiple
19:13
reasons why Josh Shapiro would be a very
19:15
good pick and we can start with ideology
19:19
we can go to temperament and then we can
19:21
end with location location location so
19:25
ideology Josh Shapiro is a more moderate
19:28
Centrist Democrat there are a number of
19:31
initiatives for example in the state of
19:34
Pennsylvania that he has broken with his
19:36
party at least to some degree on to kind
19:39
of move towards the center for example
19:41
he has advocated for lowering corporate
19:44
tax rates in Pennsylvania the kinds of
19:46
things that Republican voters would
19:49
either appreciate or at least see that
19:51
this person is not an ideological
19:53
extremist somebody who's willing to
19:55
reach out across the aisle he's somebody
19:58
who ideologically is much closer to the
20:01
exact kinds of Voters who helped give
20:03
Joe Biden the presidency in 2020 a lot
20:06
of these Suburban voters and college
20:09
educated women and others who many of
20:11
whom had voted Republican in the past he
20:14
seems to be much more in line with the
20:16
bulk of the American people than
20:19
somebody who's more on the left side of
20:21
the democratic
20:23
[Music]
20:26
party and then let's talk about the
20:28
really important aspect of temperament
20:31
this is a guy who really by and large
20:33
has a pretty measured tone an ideal way
20:36
of confronting someone like Donald Trump
20:39
who really needs to be meticulously
20:42
rebutted in all of his falsehoods
20:45
dismantling these wild statements that
20:48
Donald Trump has made and doing so in a
20:50
calm and measured way I think is exactly
20:53
what the doctor ordered for the Public
20:55
Square it would in many ways be a restor
20:58
ation of the way we think about the
21:01
presidency that we're not just electing
21:03
a vehicle for an agenda but a human
21:06
being that we could actually have a
21:08
degree of trust
21:11
in and then finally he has the advantage
21:15
of location location location the three
21:18
most important things in real estate
21:20
he's a popular governor in a key swing
21:22
state this is perhaps the key swing
21:25
state in the 2024 election and this this
21:28
is something that's really important not
21:30
just for the sake of Pennsylvania but
21:32
other swing States I think there's some
21:34
real possibility there that he's
21:36
actually a good cultural fit for some of
21:39
these swing
21:43
States there's one other thing I didn't
21:46
mention he's relatively young he's born
21:50
in 1973 he's a gen xer and this contrast
21:54
between a Gen X candidate who's
21:56
reasonable who's sober who's sharp as a
21:58
attack against a 78-year old man who
22:03
physically is able to sort of cover up
22:04
his decline but cognitively is capable
22:08
of the exact kinds of word salads that
22:10
we saw come out of Joe Biden's mouth in
22:13
the debate the contrast I believe would
22:16
be very real and very obvious and
22:19
exactly the kind of contrast that the
22:21
American people are looking for and so
22:25
these are all things that I think speak
22:27
strongly in his favor
22:29
but I'm not going to pretend that it's
22:30
just a a no-brainer of a decision there
22:33
are also some downsides that come with
22:35
Josh Shapiro nothing major or glaring
22:38
but there's two right away that you can
22:40
think of one he's a first-term governor
22:43
I mean he's not had a complete term as a
22:45
governor and so there would be some
22:47
questions about experience and then also
22:50
it has to be acknowledged that nobody
22:51
knows who he
22:52
is if you've tuned into this and you
22:55
know who Josh Shapiro is before you tune
22:58
in you're either a Pennsylvanian or a
23:01
political nerd and nothing against
23:03
political nerds I'm one of you but it's
23:07
just part of the challenge that you have
23:09
when you are trying to introduce
23:10
yourself to the American people but on
23:12
balance when you're talking about the
23:15
identity of a candidate is he a man for
23:18
the moment it's not simply the case that
23:21
you can say that people want anyone not
23:25
named Donald Trump that's not where the
23:27
American people are they're wanting a
23:29
choice that they can feel unambiguously
23:33
good about and the debate performance I
23:36
think robbed Biden of that message now
23:40
and for the rest of the
23:42
campaign here is a different candidate
23:44
people can be voting for as opposed to
23:47
purely voting
23:49
against Donald Trump
23:52

Charles Blow
24:02
I'm Charles blo an opinion columnist at
24:05
the New York Times And while a lot of my
24:08
colleagues are making the case for
24:10
replacements for Joe Biden I'm making
24:13
the case that Joe Biden should not be
24:15
forced off the
24:17
[Music]
24:20
ticket I assume that most people who
24:23
want to replace Joe Biden want the exact
24:26
same thing that I want which is to
24:28
prevent Donald Trump from being
24:30
reelected as president of the United
24:32
States if that is the goal then you have
24:36
to go with the person who has the best
24:38
chance of defeating him and I think that
24:42
for right now that person remains Joe
24:46
[Music]
24:49
Biden there is no
24:51
evidence that any of the other
24:54
candidates who have been proposed as
24:57
possible replacement for Joe Biden would
24:59
do better than Joe Biden there is no FDR
25:04
Barack Obama like candidate waiting in
25:06
the wings who everyone knows and who is
25:08
going to
25:09
Galvanize the Democratic party the
25:13
people in Louisiana do not know the
25:14
governor of
25:16
Michigan the people in North Carolina do
25:18
not know the governor of
25:21
California and we are saying that
25:24
somehow in a broker convention at the
25:26
end of the summer with only three months
25:27
to go you could put forth forth a
25:29
virtually unknown person to the country
25:33
and that somehow that would be
25:35
better than sticking with a person who
25:38
we already
25:40
know in addition to that a broker
25:43
convention would mean that the voters
25:47
would not have a say in who the
25:49
candidate is there would be no direct
25:52
voting for the person that the Democrats
25:55
put forward these would be delegates
25:57
some them are elected officials and I
25:59
guess you could say that elected
26:01
officials are kind of secondhand
26:02
representatives of the people so people
26:04
did vote for the elected officials and
26:06
if they vote for the candidate maybe
26:07
that's makes you feel a little bit
26:09
better but delegates are also Party
26:11
leaders no one voted for these Party
26:14
leaders these are just people who have
26:16
participated and one favor and people
26:19
like them and those are the people who
26:21
would pick the
26:22
candidate that is not Democratic that
26:26
doesn't feel like the business that the
26:28
Democratic party would want to be
26:31
in which is having the candidate
26:36
produced not by the voice of the people
26:39
but by the voice of the
26:43
Insiders this has become an election
26:47
about people who are for democracy and
26:49
those who are not for it it has nothing
26:52
to do with the individual people and the
26:53
individual characters and their
26:55
individual competency so I'm not trying
26:59
to convince anyone that Biden is your
27:01
best candidate he's a fantastic person
27:03
and you know shooting on all cylinders
27:05
and full of Verve I'm just saying that
27:09
as it stands he is likely your best
27:13
option to prevent
27:17
catastrophe none of these candidates are
27:21
people that I'm going to say oh I'm just
27:22
jumping up and down because this person
27:25
is so electric and magnetic
27:28
I'm simply saying do you want to keep a
27:30
country or not where is your best
27:31
chances of keeping the country that you
27:33
know and you love and that will have a
27:35
chance to fight again one day with
27:38
different candidates who may be younger
27:39
may be more of your
27:42
tastes I am
27:44
convinced that people are not scared
27:48
enough yet I don't think that people
27:51
will be turning out for Biden they'll be
27:52
turning out against Donald
27:56
Trump I don't need a champion in the
28:00
White House this
28:03
cycle what I need is someone to
28:06
hold the White House and to hold the
28:10
country in its current
28:12
customs in its current
28:15
structure so that the next cycle maybe
28:18
we have better options that we can be
28:20
excited
28:22
about Joe Biden is already strapped to
28:25
the
28:26
rocket at this point
28:28
he remains the best
28:35
