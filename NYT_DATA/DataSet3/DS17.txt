Social Media, Phones and Our Miserable Kids



0:00
I feel like like all the trains in Italy canel can I once got stuck in pizza when
0:05
they canel the trains yeah it was a great opportunity for me to tell my kids about the failures of European social
0:11
welfare capitalism oh good kids love that from New York Times opinion I'm
0:19
Ross D I'm Michelle CLE I'm Carlos loada and I'm Lydia ping and this is matter of
0:26
opinion woohoo we're it no it's a reunited we're all
0:31
recording in the same room together I could almost touch all of my co-hosts
0:37
right now and then caros would call each other but I will not because because we're talking about disconnection
0:43
virtual alienation we're going to talk about kids and smartphones so there is a lot of
The Problem
0:51
evidence that kids American Kids maybe kids around the developed world are not
0:57
doing so well over the last 10 years not just in a sort of kids being kids way
1:03
but there is a real shift in rates of depression anxiety mental illness
1:10
diagnosis suicide and suicidality all of these things are up for young people and
1:17
so are hours spent on smartphones and there's a widely circulated Theory
1:23
seemingly plausible but also hotly contested that screens and social media
1:28
are responsible for making teenagers especially unusually
1:34
unhappy so this is a big problem since screens and smartphones are sort of the defining Technologies of our age and I'm
1:40
hoping we can resolve this problem here today in a podcast maybe not but maybe we can
1:46
debate some solutions responses and talk about what might be going too far in our
1:53
desire to protect kids so let's get started with a personal question for those of you us who have kids or
2:00
teenagers in the house or out of the house what are the rules for smartphones
2:06
in your home so I've got the oldest I think mine are 2018 so right now there are no rules it's obviously a
The Rules
2:12
free-for-all but when they were it's a vicious lscape it's Lord of the Flies
2:18
Michelle's house the only contact I get is when somebody wants to text me for money but um that was that was me so I'm
2:24
sorry about that but Ross so going back though I think we
2:30
hit the smartphone button when they were in seventh grade because that's when
2:35
they went to middle school and that's kind of just that was the standard around here and then we tried to set
2:42
limits on screen times and things like that and I have to say the pandemic made
2:47
that infinitely more complicated Carlos so first rule of
First Rule of Parenting
2:52
parenting is you don't talk about parenting now the first R of parenting is that each kid is different right so I
2:58
have three kids one kind of mid- teens one early teens and one is finishing up Elementary School my oldest who 16 has a
3:04
smartphone he only got it last year and he uses it mainly to be in touch with us um with his editor at the student paper
3:11
with his friends my daughter's 13 has one of those little mini oldfashioned iPods which she uses to communicate with
3:18
text and email with friends with her dance group or her Orchestra friends and to listen to books and my youngest who's
3:24
10 wants an Apple Watch but isn't getting it um they don't use any kind of
3:30
social media we don't ban it but we sort of discourage it and part of the trick is that they really don't have a lot of
3:37
free time between you know theater or dance or baseball or student journalism they don't have a lot of time to go on
3:43
social media we're keeping our fingers crossed that it stays that way at least until they reach you know the Age of
3:49
Reason um the age of reasonableness we're still waiting on that at 41 but that is sort of the the way it works so
3:57
far in our home huh that's interesting I mean I don't have kids as you all know um but I've tried to imagine what rules
I dont have kids
4:03
and limits would I want to set and I I think in some ways Carlos what you're describing it sounds like both kind of
4:09
an ideal but also like very very tough because in order to make sure that your kids have like really really full lives
4:15
it probably requires a lot of Engagement from you and your wife and like living in the modern world s we we're all very
4:21
very busy and um and I think about the way that I grew up and we're all Gen X and I had perhaps an extreme version of
4:29
the Freer range childhood even though my mother was technically a stay-at-home mom she did not want to see us home all
4:35
day and we sort of ran wild it's hard for me to imagine wanting anything different for my own children but I I
4:40
realize that's not the world that we live in but Ross you have the youngest kids of all of us so you're you're just sort of staring this down and you have a
The anxious generation
4:47
a bunch of them so we well yeah and the oldest is 13 and
4:52
she still does not have a phone of any kind and my assumption is that we will
4:58
crack and get her some kind of what my kids call a dumb phone next year for 8th
5:05
grade she is trying to negotiate with me to get a smarter phone insisting that
5:11
she would never use social media she will probably invoke the idea that she's so busy you know the excuse the LIE mys
5:18
are feeding me the lie your kids are feeding you but I I it it is very unlikely that we would crack on that but
5:24
we really haven't entered fully into this world but I want to pick up on
5:30
Lydia's comment about the Freer range childhood because one of the reasons we're talking about this this week is
5:37
that this debate has been running for a while but it's resurfaced because of a new book by Jonathan height called the
5:45
anxious generation that's basically height making the case not just that
5:51
there's something specific about let's say the social life of teenage girls on
5:57
Instagram or Tik Tok or the social life of teenage boys playing video games
6:03
that's a problem for mental health but also that this is a substitute for
6:08
exactly the kind of childhood you're describing so it's not just sort of the screens themselves are the devil it's
6:15
also that the screens themselves have reshaped social life and eliminated
6:20
certain features of childhood that taught people how to be adults taught
6:25
people how to navigate interpersonal Dynamics in person how to communicate
6:31
with the opposite sex how to settle fights on the playground with their friends this kind of thing height has a
6:38
number of critics who basically say he's making a correlation causation mistake that yes it happens to be that mental
6:44
health has gotten worse over in the smartphone era but that does not prove that the phones are the problem do you
Do you guys buy the argument
6:51
guys buy the argument I mean I you know have sort of read the competing correlation causation arguments and of
6:58
course have looked in detail at every single study and weigh I personally
7:03
running regression analyses I was going to say I I have so many histograms you would not believe it you would not
7:08
believe the number of histograms but um to me the bigger question is the one of emphasis should we be more concerned by
7:16
the vacuum that was created by putting children into a much more protective
7:22
bubble is the problem that we need to solve the transformation of childhood into what many kids experience as
7:30
much more tightly controlled and scheduled and mediated through parents as opposed to mediated through your
7:36
friend groups and and learning how to build your own boundaries and relationships and things like that or do
7:41
we tackle the problem at the level of smartphones look I personally believe that I have a dysfunctional relationship
7:47
with smartphones and so it's very easy for me to look at kids and be like oh yeah of course they must also have a very dysfunctional relationship but
7:54
honestly I don't know I think it's always a problem to put too much emphasis on any one particular culprit
8:00
and it is generally our impulse to blame technology I mean TV did TV ruin kids
8:07
probably but that is one of the one of the panics that we had and then for
8:12
years everyone told us that violent video games absolutely positively we
8:18
turning our children into sociopaths this on one level is what we do we
8:25
decide it's something that we can tackle simply or blame simply but then there's 30 questions I have as to what we're
8:32
really worried about here I mean are we upset about kids sitting around on their phones whether than playing outside uh
8:37
worried about them doing less in-person socializing worried about them becoming addicted to external affirmation from
8:43
their online groups upset about them having access to scary news and inappropriate information upset that
8:49
they're not as independent worried about bullying I mean there's so many things that fall into this category that we've
8:55
just decided are all about smartphones so I think the virtue of the height
Divergence
9:01
argument it's a technology is doing something bad argument that has a pretty
9:06
narrow and focused zone of concern and that zone of concern is the fact that
9:14
young people report being unhappier as young people than was the case generally
9:20
in our cohort and preceding generations and this pretty clearly tracks to a kind
9:27
of point of Divergence I think 2012 to 2014 is sort of a break point in the
9:33
data if you just look at the charts that height puts together you say well yeah
9:38
something clearly happened in this window that is not just teenagers or
9:44
teenagers you need some explanation and that's why his critics have tended to sort of also put forward contingent time
9:52
bound speculations like it's the aftermath of the financial crisis it's the rise of school shootings and school
9:58
shooting there is I think a sort of quest for a
10:03
particular kind of explanation because you have this Divergence in the data now there is also the response or argument
10:11
that what we're seeing here is just better diagnosis that kids have had these mental health problems all the
10:17
time and For Better or Worse many people would say for better some people would
10:23
say For Worse we're talking more about mental health maybe that's the whole Divergence we've become more open to
10:29
these discussions or more likely to offer these diagnoses and that alone istic societ we're a therapeutic society
10:35
and it's finally achieved takeoff and that's where we are now I try to be skeptical of the height thesis because
10:42
it confirms my priors like Lydia I have a toxic relationship to my smartphone I
10:47
don't use that much social media but the social media I use I'm addicted to and make the excuse that it's part of my job
10:53
so I have a natural inclination to buy into the argument so I try and be more skeptical of it but I think that right
11:00
now it's a pretty parsimonious explanation for at least some of this Divergence you're saying parsimonious in
UNICEF Report
11:06
a positive way in a positive in a positive in a positive sense yeah because the data are quite dramatic I
11:12
mean I I I was looking for sort of other sources of information about this because height in his book talks about
11:18
actually this data is global that these are things that we're seeing in other countries so I was looking at other kind of alternative sources of data on this
11:24
and there was a there was a UNICEF report that was published in 2020 and it's really interesting like actually how much of an outlier the US is and
11:31
this is a place where I actually have a significant amount of of skepticism about the hate book it counted 38 of the
11:37
wealthiest countries in the world and the United States was 32nd in terms of mental well-being on this list and the
11:44
top five were not what you would expect they were uh the Netherlands Cyprus Spain Romania and Denmark um so this is
11:51
just I mean I would have predicted Romania absolutely maybe not the rest absolutely the reports in this study on
11:57
the effect of technology use was one4 the size of the effect from bullying for
12:03
example so I came to this information saying like oh yeah this all sounds plausible but the the more I dug into
12:10
other sources and and other cuts at looking at this question of child happiness the more skepticism that I had
12:16
that this sort of one explanation was enough I think you need to take the two the changes of childhood and Technology
12:22
together height does push back against the critics who say it is a monocausal explanation by saying that look I'm
12:28
talking about the changes to the independent childhood that we had in you know the 70s or the 80s versus today and
12:36
I I accept that defense of his but in some ways he if you look at just his his
12:42
body of work even just like his Atlantic articles over the years right he does
12:48
feel like he's sort of beating the same drum over and over again with you know slightly different speeds I read each
12:55
piece individually and I feel persuaded I read them together and I feel
13:00
suspicious right I don't mean suspicious in in kind of an ill intent on the part of the writer kind of way but I think of
13:06
a world view that maybe explains too much and I I also wonder if like
Childhood Creativity
13:11
different kids are different so when I was a kid my mother was obsessed obsessed with us not watching too much
13:17
television because she thought it was going to rot our brains she would come home and she would put her hand on the top of the TV set and if it was warm
13:24
she'd know that we broken the rules and my mother did not mess around she'd unplugged the TV she'd get out a pair of
13:30
scissors and she'd snip off the plug oh my God as a punishment so that we would not watch it again totally totally
13:36
badass we were we were that's that's real parenting but I I want to tell you I want to tell you it's even better
13:41
parenting you know what my brothers and I did we would go to Radio Shack and we would buy a a plug and then we taught
13:47
ourselves how to reattach a plug and then not make it look like so you have skills this is
13:53
exactly going to childood are going to bypass any form of control but height
13:59
would say that is the kind of like childhood creativity that is being lost the ability to do end rounds
14:07
when exactly Ross you mentioned school shootings I mean this month believe it or not will Mark 25 years since
Columbine
14:15
Columbine and the kids that heid is talking about are kids that have grown
14:21
up entirely in a world formed by that experience I don't
14:27
just mean Coline but I mean this of experience of lockdown drills and schools knowing that every day they're going to a place where they're meant to
14:35
be taught and educated and protected but that they feel at risk the reason my son
14:42
has a smartphone is because there were bomb threats at his school which he covered as a student journalist but
14:48
that's why he has a smartphone to begin with I find that argument totally unpersuasive to explain the Divergence
The Divergence
14:56
that you see starting in the early 2010 like it doesn't track particularly with the
15:01
rise of school shootings it doesn't track at all with General violence in schools which was much higher in the
15:08
1980s and early 1990s than today and it does you know with allowing lyia point
15:15
that the data is complex it does show up the teenage mental health issue in lots
15:20
of other countries that don't have active shooter drills and so on what's odd in this debate is that height is
15:29
making an argument that in a way sort of tracks pretty well with a lot of traditional leftwing preoccupations he's
15:35
saying a bunch of big rapacious capitalist entities in order to make a
15:41
profit are exploiting your children and destroying their mental health and a lot
15:48
of people on the left are like no that's not satisfying enough it has to be something that like Republicans did
15:53
right cuz Silicon Valley isn't coded as Republican it has to be climate change CU we can blame Republicans for that it
15:58
has to school shootings CU we can blame Michelle's Southern relatives and their guns for that um that feels very
16:06
sensitive but like like I don't I don't know it's like you're just looking for I mean there are many reasons why children
16:12
can be anxious all at once I worry a little bit about height pointing to smartphones as the overwhelming reason
16:19
there are multiple reasons why any one kid can be having trouble and another
16:25
and and this is where I was headed I wasn't sort of saying that you know therefore the explanation is school shootings you know in the panoply of
16:31
possible reasons for kids to be struggling another is you know Lydia and Ross have mentioned that you have your
16:36
own toxic addictive relationships with your phones I mean these are also kids who have grown up with parents who are
16:42
entirely Tethered to their devices and who basically a few years ago I read
16:47
this book by Sher turkle called reclaiming conversation and she had a line that like has stuck with me since then where she says that all our
16:54
relationships now come with the Assumption of divided attention and that is all all the more so with children
Reclaiming Conversation
17:01
seeing the divided attention that their parents already distracted and busy and tired parents give to them all right
17:09
let's take a break and when we come back we'll talk about whether we should be even looking for Solutions here and if
17:16
so what they might [Music]
17:27
be
How are we going to save our children
17:34
[Music] one of the things that I'm interested in is when you start talking about what to
17:40
do about it then it gets really sticky though and I think one of the things that does bother me is when the states
17:47
start looking at well how are we going to save our children they start talking about putting limitations on what kids
17:53
can do on their phones and you quickly get into questions of First Amendment rights and things like this none of which is going to matter
17:59
if you've got kids who are watching their parents sit on their phones all day long 24/7 that's like lecturing kids
18:07
not to do drugs while you're sitting there dropping acid so there is a question about how we're going to tackle
18:14
this and this just seems to be one of those areas that we rush to because you know it it seems like very easy to
18:22
tackle you know we've we've had several States try and limit what kids can do and what their social media account ages
18:29
but it's a lot of constitutional questions and a lot of time and energy going into something that doesn't strike
18:36
me is going to be all that useful let's I mean just on the personal side Michelle's first right since you're the
Are there things you wish you had done differently
18:44
the senior parent in this conversation meaning you know meaning the one with the most experience the one with the
18:50
most experience the wi back the wisest backpedal um your kids are basically
18:56
through through High School into college right and if you look back over the last 10 years setting aside the state setting
19:04
aside government are there things that either you as a parent or you as a
19:10
consumer of school-based services like are there things that you wish you had done
19:16
differently or things that you wish your kids schools had done differently so no one problem that I do think parents have
19:22
is once you hit a certain age with kids you can't limit their screen time because they're doing homework online so
19:30
I would try to keep limits on my kids screen time and they would just be like oh well we're just doing math homework
19:37
on our computer and unless you are going to stand over that child every minute and let's be clear it wasn't a question
19:44
of I didn't want to put in the time or effort to stand over my child it's also like you can't police your children like
19:50
that I mean you have to give your children a little bit of freedom to screw up or whatever so it was
19:56
absolutely impossible on some level it got even worse during Co yeah and and was impossible it all got my kids
20:03
friends and my kids themselves had real covid isolation issues and it became
20:10
really dark at certain times and it was really hard to tell whether you know
20:16
being able to connect with their friends on their smartphones was helping or hurting or whatever because technology
20:22
has taken over our lives I tend to think that as a society when we've given up on
20:28
being reasonable about something we then try to put limits just on the kids I asked my daughter who's 13 I told her we
Rules and limits
20:36
were going to have this conversation and uh I asked her what she thought about rules and limits and bands and she said
20:44
she didn't have a problem with there being rules and limiting access to certain things she's like we do that for lots of other stuff that seems okay but
20:51
maybe you all should have some limits too she felt that you know her her her reaction was that it shouldn't just be
20:57
for children that that a lot of bad things happen on social media when adults use social media yeah I don't know how we think we can save our
21:03
children if that's the approach that we're going to take well I guess I'll speak up for the kids first approach
First approach
21:11
then I completely agree that obviously you know the example that you set for
21:16
your kids makes a huge difference and I obviously think social media and smartphones have a deranging effect on
21:22
adults too but childhood is both a era of Greater personal social emotional
21:30
vulnerability than adulthood and also a period in which we take for granted that
21:36
it is possible to impose substantial regulations that in a free Society we
21:41
can't impose on adults and we do this with lots of things we do this with driving there's lots of terrible drivers
21:47
on the road but we don't say oh you know we can't let adults drive because we're showing kids that they'll be bad drivers
21:53
when they grow up same with you know alcohol tobacco products all of these things and we can argue back and forth
21:59
about where the exact line should be but I I do think that social media age
22:04
requirements things like Banning smartphones from schools and so on are just obvious first steps that don't get
22:11
you close to fixing all of the problems but are things that you should just do and see what happens as you were talking
22:17
I was thinking about some of the cultural differences about this you know I don't think there's any society that's like okay we want to teach our children
22:24
to have a healthy relationship with uh with tobacco but when it comes to
22:29
alcohol there is a different attitude alcohol is seen as an important source
22:35
of conviviality of pleasure of enjoyment and cultivating one's temperate
22:41
enjoyment of it is something that starts relatively early in life and let's set social media aside for just one second
22:47
and just talk about technology and screens in general we are all going to live in a world where screens are going to be a part of it and I'm not going to
22:53
give my baby a bottle filled with uh watered down wine right but I might give
22:59
my 13-year-old a very very small glass of wine watered down with Seltzer at
23:04
Thanksgiving or whatever that to me feels like more of approach that that I could get behind rather than just ban
23:10
and I think about my own consumption of Television I mean I told that very funny story about my mom and cutting the cord the reality is that if there is a
23:17
television on in a room I cannot pay attention to anything else I mean if there was a television over the other side of your shoulder Ross I would be so
23:24
distracted whereas my wife who grew up in a household where the TV was on all all the time can just tune it out it's
23:31
just white noise to her so I guess like if we're going to live in a world with these Technologies how do we prepare
23:36
kids to have healthy relationships to them to turn them into tools that can serve them the problem is is if it just
23:43
takes over your entire life um to be The Optimist the cockeyed Optimist here
Legislation
23:50
right Lydia brought up tobacco the United States had a massive Public Health campaign against tobacco that in
23:57
fact did lead to dramatic changes in smoking social acceptability and all these things and there is this range
24:05
of proposals in Congress there's the kids online safety act which would require Tech platforms to make various
24:12
design changes protect kids on social media act which would establish an age minimum and parental consent and then
24:19
there's sort of this General there's a lot of grandstanding in Congress about you know what meta has done wrong and
24:25
you know the different ways these platforms have ed kids and to the extent
24:31
that you find the public psychological Health arguments around Tech and social media
24:37
persuasive is there any law or public health measure that you would like to
24:42
see pass or imagine would be helpful or is it does it just not seem like a political problem I'm not convinced it's
24:48
a political problem and I also think a lot about the ways in which such laws could be used as a queer person I think
24:55
about like kids who are trying to figure out who they are and you know what are the places that they might connect with
25:00
other people like them obviously I grew up in a connection desert growing up in
25:05
in eastn West Africa we didn't even have a home phone for a while so I don't romanticize the disconnected life at all
25:12
I think loneliness has lots of different facets to it and I think that IRL friendships are great but friendships
25:18
over distance I think can be very very meaningful we have a whole literature of epistolary friendships letter writing
25:24
another Lost Art another Lost Art I mean you know the smartphone has killed yeah voice memos on the other hand so yeah
25:30
I'm I'm skeptical about the about the role of legislation in this area I mean I think actually like profound social
25:36
changes are needed I think that you know we need to rethink the way that we treat children in society the amount of
25:43
Freedom the amount of autonomy that we give them obviously I believe that they need to be protected from dangerous
25:48
things but and this is just my bias from my own experience having been a very very independent kid I I I'm a strong
25:53
believer in child Independence I think laws sometimes reflect social change and
25:59
sometimes anticipate them and I would be open to a lot of the kind of reforms
26:07
that Jonathan height suggests to some degree of of limiting access to social
26:12
media I'm persuaded by the potential educational impact of smartphone bans or
26:18
at least severe reductions in smartphone use in schools at the same time I still
26:24
believe that there there is a Multiplicity of factors
26:30
behind the mental health and well-being crisis that we're seeing with kids in
26:36
the United States so I'm both open to them but skeptical that they would solve
26:42
the underlying issue that we're facing all right well let's close out by just
Looking Forward
26:47
looking forward a little bit because I'm curious where you guys think this debate
26:54
will be in 10 or 20 years maybe at the point point where some of our children
27:00
are parenting themselves oh can't wait for that can't wait for that and grandchildren you know reversing the
27:06
burst Earth anyway um different podcast podcast different episodes but but isn't it all the same episode Lydia I'm
27:14
curious sort of generally because there's also a way in which when technological change happens sometimes
27:20
by the time you figure out what's going wrong in one particular dispensation we're headed into a new dispensation
27:27
right so just hearing the way that schools rely on the internet and Tech for assignments and so
27:35
on does that survive the age of chat GPT and AI assistance is it possible that
27:42
we're going to head into a landscape where all of education is going to have to recalibrate itself they're never going
27:48
analog they're not going back to analog it's too it's it's not going to happen Okay but so then what is what is the
27:54
world you know on the other side of AI or on the other side of any other looming technological change on the
28:00
other side ofal what's so great about it could you have predicted where we are now 20 years
28:05
ago I don't think you could have come on I mean once once once Elon Musk has put chips in all of our brains then um you
28:13
know we'll experience The Singularity and we'll and we'll know what's happening let me let me let answer all
28:18
right Carlos but no let me first say I am I am detecting just an incredible
28:23
level of fatalism from all three of you about Technologic
28:33
undo excuse paging Dr Freud we know what you
28:38
want Ross we know what I want I want the singularity too but it seems to me that there's a huge question here which is
28:45
are we going to master these kind of Technologies or be Mastered by them and I feel like are all of you just content
28:52
to drift into the nuring future Carlos the humanist I appeal to you to close us out with
28:58
resistance come now speak speak for paper speak for print speak for analog I
29:05
I only read on paper the um here I am saying that on a podcast who's read canical for Lebovitz well you know I
The Existential Perils
29:11
have that's a that's it's a book that I highly recommend um it's a book in which
29:18
the the existential Perils of Technology are taken so seriously that we attempt
29:24
to fully simplify Our Lives to purge ourselves of these Technologies yet
29:31
inevitably we recreate them with the same destructive results and just because it fails it
29:39
doesn't mean that we shouldn't make the attempt so I think it's foolish to be
29:44
optimistic in this world but it is not foolish to be hopeful but even as we make those attempts I'm I'm skeptical of
29:52
a sort of Silver Bullet answer to the problem that we've discussed today we
29:58
will simply move on to a new version of it which then we will we will look back with longing on this simpler time the
30:05
way that Lydia talked about the television story we're going to talk about trying to um you know you remember back in the in in the 2000s when we
30:12
tried to you know regulate smartphones and we didn't know that the the fill-in the blank was coming next and that was going to be even more Insidious and
30:18
destructive bra lyd is right brain chick no but I think that's I think that's a really good way of putting it Carlos and I think that the reality is that things
30:24
stop being cool like Facebook has been abandoned to the Boomers um you can pay
30:29
kids to be on Facebook other other social media and I think you know that it's sort of one of those things that's seen as a punchline but you know kids
30:36
reject the things that their parents are into and are addicted to and want to talk about and want to focus on and I
30:42
think that Things become not cool and you know that's definitely a thing that I'm seeing among young people that I
30:47
know that they're like you know what's not cool is spending all your time on social media and on that note I'm going
Back Home
30:54
to return home and explain to my 13-year-old daughter that it is her duty to make the smartphone
31:02
uncool in her middle school and high school and we'll leave it there and when
31:07
we come back we'll get hot and cold just tell her how cool you think it is and that's going to do
31:16
[Music]
31:26
it
Palm Sunday Mass
31:35
[Music] all right guys it's time to get hot cold who's got one this week uh I'm hot cold
31:42
this week Carlos so I just returned from matter of opinions official vacation
31:48
destination which is Italy Italia um and I happened to be there during Holy Week
31:54
and so we did Palm Sunday mass and and Easter Sunday mass in
32:00
Venice the Palm Sunday mass it was first of all very few people we thought like how on Earth in Venice on Palm Sunday
32:08
there are only 50 people in this church because we were at the Latin and
32:13
Gregorian Mass service and we experienced my children
32:19
my children experienced still be still my heart my my children experienced the Latin Mass which they had not done up to
32:26
this point in their lives and it was wonderful we had an
32:33
absolutely see I I was afraid I was afraid that this would kind of like trigger an an outpouring of rosess but
32:40
it was it was so beautiful just to stipulate for listeners who may have
32:46
some stereotypical view of me I do not attend the traditional Latin Mass
32:51
neither do I and I I went to Catholic I went to Catholic um you know grade school high school and college so I've
32:58
been to many variations of our liturgy and my wife and I were trying to explain to the kids even even Whispering during
33:04
the service that they had entered a sort of Time Warp where they got to experience something that is that is a lot less common these days and I think
33:11
of myself as very very much a Vatican 2 Catholic I'm all in favor of the opening up of the lurgical experience of the
33:17
role of lay people in the church but um you know it it took a long time Palm
33:23
Sunday mass is generally long and the Latin Mass version is I think a good bit longer than normal but even so it was
33:29
both a wonderful experience for me to think about a church sort of before the church that I have known and also for my
33:37
children to have a sense of this experience and to have them feel I hope some small part of them felt part of a
33:44
much longer history and tradition that's so beautiful you heard it here I am hot
33:49
on the Latin M don't have anything can add anything to hot on the Latin that that sounds like a really really amazing
33:55
experience I'm I'm glad for you and your family that is down beautiful amazing okay we got to stop there before you
34:01
know anything happens to to spoil to spoil the Catholic mood don't say a
34:07
