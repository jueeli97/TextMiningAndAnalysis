The Pro-Life Movement Had a Plan Post-Roe. The G.O.P. Didnâ€™t.



0:00
there's Michelle can you hear us is it not working in here either oh what was that you sound like a demon from Hell
0:08
guys I think you're going to be glad to have some Catholics on this episode just
0:14
just putting it out there from New York Times opinion I'm Lydia pen I'm Michelle coddle I'm Ross D
0:22
I'm Carlos lzada and this is matter of
0:28
opinion [Music]
0:36
all right guys so I wanted to talk about where the debate over abortion is going and I want to talk about it in light of
0:41
a recent decision by Alabama Supreme Court which ruled that Frozen embryos should be considered children and that
0:48
the destruction of Frozen embryos can amount to the wrongful death of a human being this decision obviously is coming
0:54
at a very politically potent moment since the Supreme Court overturned roie Wade fights over abortion have upended a
1:01
lot of our fixed ideas about politics it played Havoc with the midterms in 2022 and now it seems as though other areas
1:09
of uh reproductive Health Care are up for grabs just in time for the 2024 election but before we go to where the
1:15
debate is headed this ruling took me really by surprise I wasn't expecting it and so I'm curious did you guys have any
1:21
personal reactions to hearing it and were you surprised uh yeah you know often with
1:27
significant cases that are going to generate either big public controversy or potential big policy impacts you know
1:34
we we hear about them sometimes months ahead of time this came like a lightning bolt but you've been hearing a lot of
1:39
warnings that post dos things like IVF could potentially be at risk so there's
1:44
also some kind of I told you isms going around but not with me this was very surprising so I like Carlos had not had
1:52
forewarning that this was in the pipeline I just had missed it somehow but what actually happened does not
1:58
surprise me um I'm never surprised by anything so yeah no I mean I I think I I was not
2:06
familiar with all of the details of the specific Alabama laws that were
2:12
interpreted in this case and so I won't pretend to have had forn knowledge in that sense but having some kind of IVF
2:19
flash point in the abortion debate I think was pretty much inevitable yeah
2:24
yeah well before we get too deeply into you know how this is playing out politically and what what some of the
2:30
big issues are that are at stake here could somebody just walk us through the specifics of this particular case in the
2:36
decision um Carlos I have a feeling you actually sat down and read the entire decision and all the all the Des so I'm
2:42
G to call on you where would you where would you get that where would you get that idea um yes I just assumed we all
2:48
did but I will go ahead yeah I read it last night actually I do recommend that folks read it it's incredibly
2:54
interesting so as Lydia said the Alabama Supreme Court ruled Frozen embryos can be considered children referred to them
3:00
as extrauterine children under state law the case that led to that ruling involved three couples whose Frozen
3:07
embryos were accidentally destroyed in a fertility clinic in Mobile Alabama now
3:13
they were not harmed in the normal course of IVF treatment or in the transport of embryos as sometimes
3:19
happens but rather when someone just kind of wandered into the unlocked storage area the the cryogenic nursery
3:25
uh as they call it and dropped several embryos on the floor now these coupled it's important to know are people who in
3:32
some cases had already had children through IVF treatment they sued the clinic and also the local hospital where
3:38
the storage facility was located for wrongful death and the Court ruled 8:1 that the failure to secure the storage
3:45
area violated the state's wrongful death of a minor act the court also relied on
3:51
a constitutional amendment from 2018 pre-dbs it should be noted that recognized the sanctity of unborn life
3:57
and of unborn children now since the rule came down the Alabama State Legislature has voted to protect IVF
4:03
providers from lawsuits but one thing that's gotten a lot of attention is that while the main opinion Drew largely on
4:09
interpretations of state law and the state constitution there was a concurring opinion by the chief justice
4:15
that invoked sort of very overtly religious language he wrote that all life is made in the image of God and
4:21
that human life cannot be wrongfully destroyed without incurring the wrath of a holy God so this has you know as you
4:28
can imagine become a big part of the story of this case yeah I mean I think
4:34
this question of the wide variety of religious views on this issue is actually important and I think there's a
4:39
pretty diverse set of views on this Ross maybe you can give us a sense of like what the lay of the land is for
4:46
Christians in particular I can try it's I would say in
4:51
certain ways a fairly unsettled area where I think you have a lot of people Christians and otherwise who haven't
4:58
necessarily sort of thought thought through all of the implications of their own positions on these issues but there
5:03
is a specifically Catholic objection to IVF style fertility treatment which is
5:10
connected to the idea that human beings should be created in the loving Act of a
5:16
man and woman not in some sort of method that is alienated from that act it's
5:21
different from what you might call the sort of generic pro-life issue with IVF
5:28
which is not about those Catholic arguments exactly so much as it's just saying to the extent that IVF involves
5:36
the intentional destruction of embryos it you know involves the destruction of a human life a lot of people who are
5:43
sort of generally pro-life just don't honestly think that closely about this issue at all sometimes have used IVF
5:50
themselves sometimes just you know like most people in contemporary America know someone who's gotten pregnant through
5:56
IVF and if some of these issues were pointed out to them might become more
6:03
concerned about how IVF is practiced but generally just take the view that the
6:08
IVF debate and the abortion debate are kind of separate and it's that perspective I think that's driven much
6:14
of the political reaction to this where you know most prominent Republican
6:19
politicians starting with Donald Trump you know never never a man especially interested in sort of moral and
6:25
Theological consistency have basically come out and said oh you know well obviously like IVF should be allowed and
6:32
we want to encourage people to have families who have issues with fertility and so on right all right so taking a
6:38
step back I'm not so much fascinated by the people who object to IVF I figure
6:45
that is a pretty consistent position from a religious standpoint especially if you are of the mind that an embryo is
6:52
a child what I am finding completely fascinating and I have to admit to a little bit of satisfaction on this are
6:59
the large number of ostensibly pro-life Republicans who have just flat out
7:05
panicked about this ruling either because they were just lazy in their
7:10
thinking about Reproductive Rights or because they've realized that they were
7:16
not prepared for this outpouring of public outrage on this issue I mean if
7:23
you are extremely consistent in your pro-life views you really shouldn't IVF
7:30
that's pretty shabby moral thinking I'm sorry just is yeah and I think there was
7:36
also a lot of punditry in the immediate aftermath of dobs that poo pooed the idea that Clarence Thomas's descent that
7:43
talked about going after oer gafel that that was all kind of liberal overreacting hyperventilating um and you
7:50
know there was also a line of argument that was basically like yeah look this is not going to affect birth control or IVF this is just about abortion and to
7:56
me that's a little bit like the people who are like don't worry Trump will accept defeat and leave office in in 2020 so I I think political Panic is
8:04
probably the the right word to describe what we're seeing but it is important to stress and I think Carlos as the Deep
8:10
reader will agree that this decision was actually not texturally based on dos or
8:18
on abortion law it was it was based on laws that were in existence and were sort of accepted under row you know as
8:25
long as you had legal abortion you also could have laws that said if somebody injures a pregnant woman and their child
8:31
dies they can sue for damages but I want to jump in here and say that this being a legal issue you use every ruling for
8:38
your side's furthering of your approach to this you can parse this all you want to and I've seen people like Ed wheelen
8:45
doing this saying oh it's not really about abortion it doesn't really count on dobs but as we know part of what
8:51
chief justice Parker in Alabama has done is he's used every opportunity even if it's not really closely related to
8:57
abortion rulings to build this legal infrastructure that can then be pointed to by other courts to say well if this
9:05
is true then this must be true so I am not actually comforted by whether or not this was strictly based on or not
9:12
there's a reason we're see hold on car caros even wanted to jump in yeah what's interesting to me about the the politics
9:19
of this is I feel there's a sense in which Republicans are going to have to
9:25
make up their minds about what it means to be pro-life the sort of caught in a bind as Ross mentioned you have party
9:31
leaders like speaker Johnson like Donald Trump coming out in strong support of IVF but there is a non-trivial segment
9:39
of the party including speaker Johnson in the past who have supported you know life at conception acts constitutional
9:46
protections for you know pre-born humans and so I think that you have to decide
9:53
if being pro-life means being pro- natalist you know which would make you
9:58
Pro in vitro or Pro personhood which would make you perhaps
10:04
question in vitro fertilization much more along the lines that Ross explained so that's a dilemma that's something
10:09
that they're going to have to square and they haven't so far and what you wind up having then is that people like Nikki
10:16
Haley and like the entire Senate Republican campaign arm which sent out a memo to its candidates saying if you
10:23
don't come out in favor of IVF you are committing political malpractice and this is insanity you
10:30
need to be pro pro pro okay well if the whole idea of protecting embos is going
10:38
to be consistent except when it suits like affluent people who can afford IVF
10:44
then you start to question what actually their problem is that's when it starts to get into well maybe they just only
10:52
care about certain people or certain processes or things like that right and
10:58
I think the context is important here what is IVF for and you know we are a a group of gen xers um you know Ross sort
11:04
of on the cuss in I'm in Gen X you will not you will not you will not read whether we
11:12
want you in here but like I mean I think we all know personally people who have struggled with fertility and and
11:19
probably know people personally who have accessed IVF right tons of them tons and tons of them and you know IVF is a
11:25
really important technology that helped people start families later and that you
11:31
know starting families later is often a way for women to have more control over
11:37
how their careers unfurl you know so so IVF is a real felt need and you know I
11:42
think a feminist drive for women to have more control over when and how many children that they have so this is all
11:49
in the same bucket as abortion right like I mean I think that's the it's fundamentally about like your
11:54
reproductive Destiny and who gets to make decisions and on what timeline and how many children and all of that kind
11:59
of stuff and I find it particularly Rich the conservatives who don't like contraception who have come after
12:05
contraception on the off chance that you know certain kinds prevent implantation and they cannot abide that because that
12:13
embryo is a baby well I'm sorry but if that's the case you can't back IVF
12:19
because those embryos are babies too and the way it's practice you are looking at thousands of Frozen babies in cryogenic
12:27
nurseries if you're going to be that strict about it you got to stick to your guns people I I feel like you're you're
12:34
angry at Republicans whichever stance they take here basically trying to say to you're saying to conservatives either
12:40
you have to bite the bullet and acknowledge that which for the purpose of this conversation I'm happy to
12:45
acknowledge yes I think it's a big problem that there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of essentially
12:51
human beings that we keep on Ice in this country um I'll bite that bullet but the
12:57
alternative you're saying is Well if you won't bite that bullet if you want to essentially carve out an exception for
13:03
IVF then you are you know a terrible hypocrite who just wants to control
13:08
women's bodies or something when in fact all Republicans are doing in that case is doing what Democrats do with late
13:14
term abortion which is trying to sort of be a little fuzzy have it both ways and get closer to the muddy the muddy middle
13:21
on abortion right I mean isn't that what you want shouldn't you be happy if Republicans are moving towards the
13:26
center rather than then saying oh well just proves again that you're building the handmaid's tale
13:32
dystopia well look I mean I think hypocrisy I mean what's the saying hypocrisy is the nod that Vice gives to
13:37
Virtue I don't expect total consistency from any politician but I do think that
13:44
there is a sort of fundamental problem here that which is that like ultimately you have a political party elements of
13:51
which are pushing and successfully in shining law that is really really really
13:57
far away from what most Americans think and believe and you can do that on the basis of a moral principle right I mean
14:03
if you like Ross believe that these are children then just as abolitionists believe that slavery was absolutely morally unacceptable and you could do
14:09
anything in order to stop it that is a point of view right but just to be just to be clear it is not my position that
14:16
you can do anything oh no in order to just just yes no I I didn't I didn't
14:22
think that it was can I jump in and ask Ross what is your position on IVF what is my I I think I VF should be
14:30
permissible but I think there should be limits on the number of embryos created and there should be an effort to
14:35
encourage people to only create embryos that they are likely to implant I think there's going to be some gray area
14:41
because obviously the state can't like force you to implant embryos but my goal would be to have fewer embryos on Ice
14:49
which again is what exists to some extent in other developed countries Ross comes out for harm reduction this is
14:54
great Carlos this is what the opinion the the Alabama opinion says there's this extensive discussion of IVF laws
15:03
and regulations in in New Zealand and Australia in Europe I think they mentioned Italy in particular it struck
15:10
me as interesting because I know that often in American conservative jurist Prudence it's not cool to site um you
15:16
know socialized medicine in Europe the the laws of other countries um but but here it certainly was but you know one
15:22
thing that I am struck by in the political debate here is that I I wonder if IVF is a more sort of politically
15:30
advantageous issue for Democrats than abortion because the just the polling you know suggests that there's there's
15:36
an overwhelming consensus in favor of IVF and I know I mentioned in our discussion last week with Paul Krugman
15:43
how the the original it's the economy stupid slogan actually was you know the economy stupid and don't forget about
15:49
Healthcare I can imagine in this next election cycle a version of it being
15:54
it's the economy stupid but don't forget about abortion and IVF right because these are going to be uh I can only
16:01
imagine there will be a very significant Focus for the Democrats except that the Republican
16:06
nominee is one Donald Trump who everyone consents doesn't care remotely about
16:13
abortion except in so far as it sort of helps or hurts his political prospects and whose immediate response to this was
16:20
to come out with a guns blazing Pro IVF statement so I think in that sense like
16:26
there is some odd political neutral of this issue by having Donald Trump rather than certainly than Ronda santis or you
16:33
know but even Nikki Haley as the Republican nominee yeah no I think I think there's going to be a lot of
16:39
sticky questions that are going to have to be answered and people are going to have to take stands that might be uncomfortable and while I think it's
16:44
true that Donald Trump you know doesn't give a damn about this issue and and will just do whatever is politically
16:50
expedient I think what's clear and what what's become clear is that through the you know the different kinds of of
16:57
judges uh who've been either elected or appointed in various parts of the country on Federal and and state benches
17:03
the different state legislatures you know some of which are really quite captured by you know particular
17:08
political point of view and reflect to some of the more extreme edges of of this debate I think there's just going
17:14
to be a lot of things like this that are going to pop up and surprise people and that I think is going to be a big
17:19
challenge for the Republicans to deal with I think that's totally right and it's not just the specifics I mean
17:24
Republicans can come out and say they don't like they definitely support IVF but anything that puts the question of
17:30
Reproductive Rights front and center makes people start to think well what
17:35
are their motives how far will they take this and there are a lot of states that are trying to get abortion access
17:42
amendments or ballot measures into this election year and that sort of thing is
17:47
going to drive voters the more that we're talking about anything to do with Reproductive Rights all right let's take
17:54
a quick break we'll be right back [Music]
18:07
[Music]
18:15
one of the sort of big questions that I'm hearing bubbling up in our conversation here is you know I think Michelle and I feel quite strongly that
18:22
this is a direct result of dobs and while the argument around is it or not it's all happening under the Umbra of
18:29
this new era that we're in this new post row era and that to me feels inescapable you know voters are not going to sit
18:35
down and read this decision they're going to be like oh my God there's a new thing about my Reproductive Rights and
18:40
they're going to think dubs whether or not the decision actually argues that so I think you can't really run away from it perhaps the way in which the media
18:47
covers these things also plays some role in influencing how voters receive
18:52
rulings just wanted to that's true that's true of every issue right it it is yes yes yes it is no I think I think
19:01
Ross is right that Trump as in as in so many things is able to somehow get a
19:06
free pass on issues of abortion of Reproductive Rights because people look at him and think like ah he doesn't
19:12
really think this or that but you know what there's a lot of video of Donald Trump taking Victory laps for his
19:19
ability to get Gorsuch and kavana and Barrett on the court I think it's going to be hard to make too strong a
19:27
separation and the way this Alabama ruling plays into that is interesting because as I read the decision there's
19:33
one sense in which it didn't feel like dos played a major part in it it drew on
19:39
on laws and Constitutional Amendments that long predated dos at the same time
19:45
you know it it also felt to me that you can have state justices feel more
19:51
empowered to write rulings such as this one in a Do's world not because they
19:56
draw explicitly from it but because the window has opened more widely there's a there's a cascading effect where I I
20:02
think dos grants a quote unquote permission structure to move in this direction well that's what I'm saying
20:08
about it's not the specifics of this particular case or in some instances
20:15
abortion being kicked to the states in general it's the pro-life reaction to it I think Ross is totally correct that the
20:21
pro-life movement was not prepared for road to fall and they responded in ways
20:28
like for instance thinking about making it a crime for women from a pro-life
20:33
state to cross over and get an abortion elsewhere things like that just make
20:39
people freak out because whatever your moral claims people are like wow that's
20:45
just punitive and was not what I was expecting let me say something in defense of the pro-life movement in this
20:53
context I I'm not I mean I think it's fair to say the pro-life movement was wasn't prepared for the fall row at the
21:00
same time in fact the pro-life movement is a bunch of people relatively small
21:06
group of people in the context of America working in activist groups many of them in Washington DC some of them
21:12
around the country who are trying to deal with the political reality of this larger thing called the Republican party
21:20
and it's the Republican party that's totally unprepared to like talk about
21:26
abortion argue about abortion handle it in any way in public and the pro-life
21:31
movement doesn't have the power to sort of determine what either a random state
21:36
legislator in Louisiana or Alabama does or what you know Donald Trump or Nikki
21:42
Haley says and what we're witnessing playing out is yes it's it's the
21:47
failures of the movement in some way but it's also sort of a testament to just sort of the limits of a discret movement
21:54
as an agent operating in a context where most of the people involved in US
22:00
politics don't want to think about abortion don't want to talk about abortion and when confronted with
22:05
abortion Veer in all kinds of directions badly yeah well but but but in both way
22:11
you know I think what you see with Republicans is both on the one hand you get like you know the outliers who are
22:17
saying things like you know oh we're going to prosecute women and so on and then on the other hand you have Republican legislators who are like what
22:24
can we do to make this issue magically go away and you have both things going
22:29
on and I don't think the pro-life movement has figured out what to do about that but that's the situation look
22:35
it's useful to sort of compare the two parties in this regard you know not specifically on abortion but think about
22:40
what is considered to be like an extreme kind of left point of view like defund the police no one actually defunded the
22:47
police right that was a thing that created this huge uproar there were city councils that maybe in some places tried
22:53
to do XYZ and then ended up like not actually even really being able to do it and so I I think that there is this kind
22:59
of cohesive sensibleness that is broadly enforced in the Democratic party whereas
23:06
it seems on on the right with the Republican party there are just all of these things that just keep popping up
23:11
and popping up from you know judges in particular places who are either elected
23:16
or appointed or state legislatures that are completely uncompetitive and therefore can play in these like highly
23:23
ideological spaces so again to me it speaks more to the fact that the Republican Party seems like much more
23:29
effectively hacked by people who hold opinions far outside of the mainstream
23:35
than the Democratic party is at the moment I mean I don't know about that I think that I an example I think that
23:41
there well well so on the Republican side right let's see what happens with with IVF right and we can revisit this
23:48
conversation in six months or a couple years and if you get a bunch of Republican states that either ban IVF or
23:55
sort of embrace models that effectively close all IVF clinics in the state then
24:02
I'll agree that that is sort of a surprising example of a very small faction within the Republican Party
24:08
working its will politically I'm pretty skeptical that that's going to happen you know I know more people who are anti
24:15
IVF I'm sure than anyone else who works at the New York Times and I am pretty skeptical that their views are going to
24:22
actually be law in Alabama or Mississippi in 2 years right but let's see I mean we'll we'll see no but but
24:28
Ross I'm sorry like can you give me like what's a comparable example on the left you sort of said the comparable the
24:35
comparable example the way American politics works is that the comparable examples on the left tend to be in city
24:41
government rather than state government well that's a pretty big difference right well I mean what's you know which
24:47
what is more important to America Philadelphia and San Francisco or a you
24:52
know a rural or a rural Red State yeah I think that's I think these are open questions I think control of the city
24:58
governments of the Bay Area is more politically important than political control of the government of Nebraska yes absolutely okay 100% I want to take
25:06
a step back here speaking to whether or not this is like some kind of outlier example or whatever so in the
25:12
last Congress 167 House Republicans co-sponsored the life at conception act
25:19
which would confer full personhood rights incling speaker Johnson 14th Amendment rights fertilized eggs then
25:26
you start a battle between the rights of the mother and the rights of the fertilized egg at whatever stage that if
25:36
we're taking this seriously it's going to lead to all kinds of problems by
25:42
definition that's like 167 members of the House of Representatives that is not a a friend but what you see from the
25:48
reaction from House Republicans to this ruling is that the people who signed on to that did not in fact take it
25:54
seriously which is why you see the extremely conser conservative speaker of the house immediately coming out with a
26:00
statement in support of IVF which is I think a reflection of again the actual position it sounds like with Ross saying
26:08
don't take the life at conception act seriously and Lydia saying well no one really defunded the police it sounds
26:15
like we don't need to take seriously the sort of fringer positions on either side
26:21
of the spectrum here and that's great but it really says something about what
26:28
we mean when we speak out in politics I think this question of like oh let's not take the extremes of either party
26:34
seriously is actually not what I believe Carlos I think these voices and particularly if they bubble up into
26:41
state level politics or national politics in a meaningful way we should take them seriously you know I think
26:47
defund the police never took off as like a thing that actually happened but I think it it had real political
26:53
consequences for Democrats Democrats have never been seen as particular particularly strong on crime and you
27:00
know that movement I think really harmed Democrats with voters and I think something very similar is going on here
27:06
there's already a belief and an inclination to not trust Republicans
27:12
when they suddenly backpedal and say no no no no no no no because the reality is this is a country where there is
27:18
majority support for abortion the polling is you know we can argue and dice the polling one way or whatever
27:23
even Donald Trump who our colleagues reported favors a 16we abortion ban
27:29
because it's a nice round number four months I think that one of the sort of core questions here is like in a
27:34
democracy to what extent should policy and like the policies that these parties are putting forward respond to the
27:42
beliefs of the people who live in that country and how far over your skis can
27:49
you get from public opinion particularly through the courts I think the question you rais is incredibly important what I
27:56
found interesting in both dos and in the Alabama ruling is how they both
28:03
recognized that what they were doing could be the cause of great social upheaval
28:11
and certainly controversial but they both basically said that's not our problem in the Alabama ruling you know
28:17
it says that the text of the wrongful death of a minor Act is sweeping and unqualified it applies to all children
28:23
born and unborn Without Limits it's not the role of the court to craft a new limit itation based on our view of what
28:29
is or is not wise public policy and Alo in dobs said something very similar he
28:36
was talking about Casey versus Planned Parenthood the 1992 case that upheld row but with some limits he wrote the Casey
28:42
plurality was certainly right that it is important for the public to perceive that our decisions are based on principle I.E not just political
28:49
decisions right and we should make every effort to achieve that objective by issuing opinions that carefully show how
28:55
a proper understanding of the law can lead to the results we reach but we cannot exceed the scope of our Authority
29:00
Under the Constitution and we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as
29:07
concern about the Public's reaction to our work so like public opinion public
29:14
reaction the social context in which these opinions land is irrelevant in
29:20
this View and both the Alabama decision and dobs present that point of view
29:25
which in a kind of like Juris credential sense sounds very Sage but to your point
29:31
when it means that courts are getting well pass public opinion um can cause a
29:37
huge backlash not the least of which is to the legitimacy of those institutions themselves I think that's absolutely
29:43
right and um I suspect we'll have lots more to say on this issue and I am sure
29:49
that our listeners do too so listeners we want to hear where you think the abortion debate is headed

30:23
back so lady we missed you dearly last week terribly a but in your absence we
30:31
recruited our colleague in times opinion Paul Krugman to talk about the economy and how it will play a role in the
30:37
presidential election and then we ask listeners how if at all the state of the economy would impact their vote and
30:45
there was one answer that we heard over and over again it's not going to affect it one bit very little hi my name is
30:53
Kelly I'm from Bloomington Indiana and the economy will not affect my vote at
31:00
all why Trump that's it just because of trump this is M from Sacramento
31:06
California the top issues for me are democracy and avoiding
31:13
authoritarian and uh women's reproductive Health as well as civil
31:18
rights the economy is well down after those hi my name is Evan I live in Tron
31:25
North Carolina the tiny tiny little town just across the border from South
31:30
Carolina in the middle of nowhere definitely Trump country the economy for
31:36
me has nothing to do with the election this year the phrase isn't it's if the economy stupid for me it's it's
31:42
democracy stupid I do not want Trump to be back in the white house I will vote
31:48
for Biden I don't care if we go into a recession huh it is all about democracy
31:55
ah he's hardcore I like it wow so one of our listeners Larry in Southbend Indiana
32:01
did South Bend University of Notre Dame for Carlos go Irish that's right go
32:10
football go footb go footb all right so Larry did point to Rising housing costs
32:15
and food costs as factors that might influence his vote but overall are very
32:20
unscientific measure of listener responses does align with Paul krugman's opinion that the economy likely won't be
32:27
the main factor driving voters decisions to selection can I I just want to
32:32
suggest that the listenership of our podcast might not be fully
32:38
representative well you don't think we're the heartbeat of America Of The Nation I what do you mean I just I love
32:44
our listenership they're the best people the finest people um but I yeah I I
32:50
think this was a slightly unscientific poll aren't we anti-science we're anti-science aren't we I I suspect our
32:56
listeners are uh more varied Than This Crew is currently giving them credit for now okay we can conclude that they're
33:04
varied it's a diverse tapestry Carlos I just I just think there might be a skew
33:10
towards what you might call postmaterialism in voting behavior all right I Trump voters out there need to
33:15
call us this week if you are listening please please vone us or people who are voting for Joe Biden because they love
33:21
