Let the Trump Vice President Auditions Begin


0:00
guys it's been a whole year that we've been doing this can you believe it happy birthday move happy birthday it feels
0:08
longer wow wow it's 50 episodes 50 5 I mean happy anniversary that's golden
0:15
right yeah this is our golden anniversary it's just like 50 years of marriage a somebody owes me a
0:22
[Music] cake from New York Times opinion I'm
0:28
Carlos Lozada I'm Michelle I'm Ross doit and I'm Lydia pgreen and
0:33
this is matter of opinion Oney old where thoughts are still allowed not
0:42
potty trained not walking yet not quite toddler actually the most annoying kind
0:48
of age yeah anyway um all right this is this is our first of uh two vep themed
0:57
episodes of matter of opinion we'll get to kamla Harris and Joe Biden sometime
1:02
soon but today we're going to talk about Donald Trump's potential running mate so
1:10
back in January so long ago when when we still cared about Iowa and things like that um we had an episode where we
1:17
shared some thoughts even some vague predictions about who Trump might choose but now we we may have a slightly
1:25
vaguely potentially clear picture of who he might be considering it's going to be
1:31
Pence oh sorry I'm sorry I know you know like don't get me started on the great U
1:37
Mike Pence but he actually kind of seemed to have an audition of a few options at a fundraising event in Palm
1:42
Beach this past weekend so for our purposes I hope we can evaluate this
1:49
parade of V hopefuls both in terms of what they tell us about Trump and kind
1:54
of how he's thinking about a potential second term and also how you know how they might fit into a second Trump White
2:01
House how does that sound we're ready let's do it so purely for reference among others that were invited to this
2:07
donor retreat thing Trump had Senator Marco Rubio of Florida JD Vance of Ohio
2:14
and Tim Scott of South Carolina he had both dtas W Doug buram of North Christy Nome
2:21
of South and New York representative Alise stonic um anyone on that list that
2:29
surprises you that elicits any kind of strong reaction somewhere between you know clear Contender or snowball in
2:37
hell I mean I was surprised that Doug Bam's name has been bopping around for a
2:42
while now just because he's super boring the only kind of benefit I see to him is
2:49
that he is low drama and would Fade Into the background and he is super rich he's very rich that that always helps good
2:56
hair good hair he does have nice hair looks the I envy his hair that's the hair I expected to have back when I
3:04
thought I was going to keep my hair you know I love that we've gone full substantive very early absolutely very
3:09
early Carlos isn't that part of the problem is that like you know the last time around Trump ran this as a you know
3:16
not as the kind of process that you would think that he'd want to right like this is a guy who's made his bones as a
3:22
uh reality television star and uh running beauty pageants and instead he had to sort of make a safe pick to sh up
3:29
his base so I feel like we're getting the full Trump treatment this time we get to do it his way but even Mike Pence
3:35
looked like he was straight out of Central Casting right so he talk about some nice hair he has some super hair so
3:41
Michelle back in January when we last left our heroes you suggested that Trump
3:47
might consider um South Dakota governor Christy gnome um you know I'm wondering
3:54
how how you stand by that or or you know is it are you kind of barking up the wrong tree
4:01
I knew you were going to do that oh there's many I could have chosen I did not have puppy kill on my bingo card I
4:08
will give you that but I still think
4:13
that you know if we move right along from Governor poppy Keller I still think the model has a lot of Merit you know
4:21
throw a little peace offering out there to the women uh find somebody who is super
4:28
loyal but you you know at the time we thought she wasn't dramatic enough to completely upstage him but but who knew
4:35
I mean do do we need to explain why we're making dog jokes about the governor of South South the governor in
4:41
her upcoming book which I understand Carlos has already mind from front to
4:47
back um has a story that she tells about how she blew away her 14-month-old puppy
4:56
Cricket um for no apparent good reason he was a bad dog and needed to be put
5:01
down that was okay Carlos I'm going to need some fact check here that was my understanding okay I received the book
5:07
last night and I finished it today just before our recording it is fresh in my
5:14
head but here's what's amazing about the dog story for some reason it's this
5:20
interlude right in the middle of her big Forum policy National Security chapter
5:26
but no but it actually works it actually works like remarkably because here's the story like she was having one of these
5:33
hunts with like some fancy friends you know like like kind of fake hunt where you like put all the pheasants in one
5:40
place so that your people can like then shoot them and did that just last weekend familiar if one of us had done
5:46
that Ross I would have guessed it would have been you oh it's funny I would have guessed Michelle but but go on yeah so
5:53
but no here's the thing so she had these dogs you know most of which were well trained except for Cricket to go up
6:00
ahead of them and kind of like Rouse up the pheasants so that the the fancy
6:05
friends could then shoot them but cricet went too far ahead before any of the hunters got there so it ruined the hunt
6:12
then on the way back crickets in in the truck or something and she stops at
6:18
someone's place a place that they have all these like chickens and Cricut jumps out and like attacks the chickens so she
6:26
writes in the book like now I hate this dog and so she decided to kill Crick she
6:33
killed Cricket because she was both embarrassed and angry it doesn't end there so what's even better is that next
6:41
she remembers that like you know what I've always had this goat that I hated and now that I'm kind of in the mood for
6:47
killing I'm just going to kill the goat too wow meanwhile all these all these workers at her house are like freaking
6:53
out because they think like she's gone she's coming for them next she's gone crazy you know and then she ends the
7:00
story of the dog and the goat and then moves into like here's the gnome doctrine of foreign policy wow it it was
7:07
it was crazy it was crazy to me and this is the chapter on foreign policy so of course I thought like this is like
7:13
invading Afghanistan and then invading Iraq just because you can right because I've always hated Saddam Hussein so I am
7:19
now pleased that she might not be in the running because of like the manner which she reacts to anger and embarrassment
7:25
like this dog made her look bad I'm going to kill the dog I don't know Trump's not really a dog guy just saying
7:31
yeah but I I I think it's a little bit like a much more extreme version of like the Katie Brit problem you know like
7:37
your your one job is just like just like kind of be a little bit normal and I mean this is just like such an extreme
7:44
version of failing at normal all right so if we've knocked Christin Nome out of contention who has a case to make for
7:51
someone who is a a strong option Ross save us save us from this discussion please all right um I think you can make
7:58
a good case that of this list Rubio makes a certain sense for Trump but he
8:04
and Trump are both residents of of Florida obviously and that is constitutionally prohibited in order to
8:11
be picked he would have to move out of the state that he represents in the Senate that seems a little challenging
8:19
but with all that being said I think setting aside the Constitutional issue um he checks various boxes the box of
8:26
you know submission in the sense that Rubio was vehemently anti-trump in 2016
8:33
and there's nothing that Trump loves more than a convert to his cause um at
8:38
the same time Rubio has remained a kind of hawkish establishment friendly
8:45
Republican through the Trump era to a greater degree than for instance JD Vance I think he would be a more
8:52
reassuring pick for a lot of Republican donors and foreign policy types who
8:58
would think okay you know if r Rubio is the VP we probably not pulling out of NATO on day one or attacking Mexico I
9:05
mean that's right Rubio Rubio can give a really good speech he's
9:10
hispanic um you know I I could go on but I think that's a good actually a good mix for where Trump is right now Ross so
9:18
you're you're off the JD Vance train I think he he was your your thought last time around right well I think it's
9:25
these are they're separate questions I I don't think I've ever thought that van is sort of the ideal pick for Trump in
9:34
terms of sort of winning the 2024 election I think Vance is much more of a pick that you make if you're saying okay
9:41
this time we're doing populist policy and we're you know and we're doing it
9:47
right and we're not letting the establishment sort of co-opt us and run rough shot over us so picking Vance is
9:52
making a pretty clear policy statement about where a trump second term would go
9:59
I'm just saying if you're doing if we're doing it sort of like as a you know beauty pageant electoral votes you know
10:07
demographic and strategic move I I think you can make a case for Rubio BL you well you know I I think
10:16
that I'm going to go with the choice who is most similar to Rubio and that is Tim
10:21
Scott you know he is obviously has shown like incredible surv loyalty but I think
10:28
that Scott you know like Rubio his roots um he came to Congress as part of the
10:33
establishment rather than part of the Maga horde uh and I think that's helpful he can sort of read as normal although
10:40
his willingness to embrace you know election denialism and things like that I think does seem like that that
10:45
mitigates against his normaly I also think that in Trump's incredibly
10:50
reductive I would say quite sort of racist way he probably thinks that Scott's going to help him attract black
10:57
voters and in particular black voters I actually don't think that uh the old
11:03
school conservatism of Scott who's very much a kind of pull you up by your bootstraps kind of Republican is
11:09
actually the pitch that appeals to the male voters of color who who are drawn to Trump so I think he's actually kind
11:15
of mistaken about that but I could see how Trump could get there as like oh yeah this guy's going to help me with
11:20
with a growth uh constituency and possibility um I I think he's wrong about that but I think that would probably be part of the calculus
11:27
Michelle now that gnome is out who's uh who's in well surveying the group of non- poy
11:35
Killers I think Alise stonic is kind of the you know the model with a Twist she
11:41
gives a nod to Suburban women you know she pre-trump spent a lot of her time working to make the party more female
11:47
friendly and still has done a lot to try and increase the number of women who run
11:53
for office who contribute to the party she's got a lot of those networks she's good with the establishment very
11:59
business friendly good with fundraising at the same time though she has come
12:05
around to be incredibly obsequious and a kind of big Maga bootlicker and has
12:12
distinguished herself with the bass by going hard after college presidents she's been big on the kind of grilling
12:19
them about the anti-Semitism on campuses this want her a lot of brownie points with Trump now I don't know if she's
12:26
Glam enough for him he might want her to get kind of a Chris no makeover but he
12:31
desperately needs um at least some small entree to Suburban women especially in
12:37
the post row era she would not be a bad pick well and I think the college President stuff um isn't actually just a
12:45
Bas play I think that there's sort of a set of college educated Suburban voters
12:51
who are not prootest right on college campuses who are very much on this
12:58
stonic side of that debate who are authentic swing voters but I I would
13:03
have said six months ago that her profile in the last couple years has been sort of almost too pure magga
13:11
convert to make her an ideal pick right but I do I do think that her role in the
13:16
hearings has sort of gotten her a little bit of that sort of potential swing
13:23
voter appeal back what's what are her positions on abortion um I assume that
13:28
she's Pro life but has she said anything that would would make us believe that she could help uh Trump amarate on the
13:36
the the party's difficulties in that issue she she would be more of a straddler I I'm sure in her record than
13:43
than gnome Rubio Vance oh yeah I wonder Lydia if in in the same way that you
13:50
suggested that Trump might in a sort of simplistic way
13:55
see Tim Scott as Shoring up his is you know Outreach to to Black voters I
14:02
wonder if in a similar way just having a woman on the ticket might seem to him regardless of like the specifics of
14:09
where she stands and what her you know specific positions are just having a woman on the ticket which sort of help
14:15
his quote woman problem right yeah no I think I think he definitely thinks that I guess the question that this all of
14:21
this raises for me though is like does Trump believe that he has weaknesses and like is he trying to solve for them
14:27
really in this process I mean I asked that genuinely because I'm I'm not sure that in his heart of heart that he
14:32
actually believes that he has any weaknesses I mean he's a eye alone can fix it guy well he picked I mean we know
14:38
that in picking pence in 2016 he was certainly acknowledging his weaknesses
14:43
now obviously the the situation is different now and he is for instance leading in the polls not trailing in the
14:50
polls right so I I definitely think you should expect a real calculation going
14:55
into the choice but you're right that he feels far less constrained our colleagues on
15:02
the news side of the times uh Maggie hman Charlie Savage and Jonathan Swan
15:08
have done a really good series on sort of what Trump's second term might look like and if I had to boil it down it
15:15
would be that he will pick up where he left off in other words he would not feel that he has to pick those kind of
15:22
reassuring figures in key positions including the vice presidency yeah we
15:27
keep reading those stories but at the same time Trump when pushed for instance
15:32
on the Ukraine vote ended up lending his tacit support to Mike Johnson's deal
15:39
with Democrats whatever his true intentions he needs money he needs donors on his side he needs to hold some
15:47
segment of suburban Republicans and moderates who don't love him even just
15:53
this list right like he's not looking to pick Steve Bannon as his running back
15:59
right he's assembled a pretty normal list of Republicans and they're leaking
16:04
things like oh maybe Tom Cotton will be Secretary of Defense right that is quite different from making like Mike Flynn
16:11
right Mike Flynn a guest from Tucker Carlson show or something Secretary of Defense I I just I think Flynn will be
16:17
back by the way in some capacity I mean he'll he'll appear at the White House that's for sure but I just don't think
16:22
we know I think this pick will tell will actually tell us a lot picking Rubio versus picking Vance versus is picking
16:29
stefanic each of those choices signal something in particular about Trump's
16:35
second term that we don't know yet but I also think that like Trump's greatest need and this is I think where we bring
16:41
in the LW is loyalty because if he wants to be able to pick up where he left off
16:47
what kept Him from doing quote unquote what he wanted you know were all of these people who got in the way who are
16:54
establishment types and loyalty doesn't necessarily mean just do whatever Trump
16:59
says it could also mean helping keep Trump in office but I think that loyalty
17:07
is to me the the most important characteristic that he's looking in in anyone and no one on this list that
17:13
we've talked about has shown any sign of any kind of disloyalty and I think falty to election denialism is probably the
17:19
you know kind of the number one kind of litmus test for that loyalty you saw that with Tim Scott this past weekend
17:25
right in that that interview totally the the question I believe it was on on Meet the Press was that sort of
17:31
straightforward you know would you accept the results of the 2024 election regardless of who wins and he he kept
17:38
saying something along the lines of how he he expects the election to be completely you know fair and above board
17:44
and for Donald Trump to win right sort of putting those things together and then the moderator kept saying like well
17:49
well no but wait what I'm saying is like regardless of who wins and he kind of like wouldn't move Beyond those talking
17:55
it's just not possible to imagine that Trump wouldn't win well or you just have to keep saying that because any other answer would be a sign of disloyalty
18:02
well ideally for Trump I think loyalty is not a passive matter I mean you see the people who have been auditioning
18:08
aggressively for this position out there on the campaign Trail and especially on
18:14
TV he's doing test drives for who can make a good argument on TV for all of
18:20
the things that are important to him I mean this is a guy obviously for whom media ability is very important so it's
18:29
not just a matter of agreeing with him or working behind you know you need to be a fighter you need to get out there
18:36
and make that case for him in an ideal scenario well but the other question here is if Trump wins the second term
18:43
he'll be in an unusual situation where he has a new vice president but not
18:49
eight years to go the vice president will immediately be certainly in the vice president's mind candidate for
18:56
president in the year of Our Lord 2028 and in that sense I think Trump's
19:02
concern might be less about like are they going to be loyal to me during the course of the 2024 election and more to
19:10
what extent does this person have a kind of independent brand that they could
19:16
sort of cultivate to get separation from me over the course of four years and in
19:22
that sense if Trump is worried about his vice president essentially just starting to run for president 6 month in or
19:29
whatever that's a case for not picking the two senators with the biggest
19:35
profiles and the biggest brands Vance and Rubio on the other hand it could be like super fun to watch him just kind of
19:41
serially perpetually humiliate either of them for the duration of four years to
19:46
constantly put them in their place which I think he would actually take a certain amount of pleasure in if he's not really
19:51
that worried I don't actually know that he would necessarily be successful at that it might turn out to be more
19:57
difficult than he'd think I mean I think the idea of succession is probably quite
20:02
intolerable to Trump I mean the idea that like somebody coming after him and picking up his mantle and to me that's
20:09
the strongest reason why Rubio and and Vance are probably out of the question their planetary gravitational pull is
20:16
just too big and the idea of the future Beyond Trump is is just kind of a priori
20:22
a solvent to loyalty I mean if you're thinking about what's next for you then you're not willing to put absolutely
20:28
everything on the line in order to protect a trump presidency particularly since Lord help us hopefully if he wins
20:35
this is his last term you know and we move on to a new post-trump political era but I think that the person that
20:41
that that thinking most benefits is actually Doug bergham yeah great head of hair Central Casting fits the part isn't
20:48
weird doesn't turn people off seems like a pretty nice guy and can only imagine being president if Trump stays with him
20:55
all the way true although I do think that's also kind of a case in a negative way for stonic because I don't think
21:01
Trump thinks about women as logical leaders I don't think that that's kind
21:06
of how he views them I think he's an old-fashioned sexist in that regard I don't think he's that intimidated by
21:12
them I don't think he looks at them and thinks oh well you know they're probably plotting to overthrow me because that's
21:18
just not how he rolls but there's no greater compliment in Trump's vocabulary
21:25
than killer and that's what he calls stefanic you're never going to hear him calling Tim Scott a killer he that would
21:31
be that would yes that would be a mistake to call Tim Scott a kill other ways maybe although you know maybe maybe
21:38
chrisy Nome Now dog killer she is absolutely definitely a killer and we're back full circle okay so we started
21:45
dabbling into succession here and I want to maybe play the succession theme yeah who's the B bur B is
21:54
the so let's take a quick break there speaking of success and when we come
21:59
back we'll talk about whether any of these potential running mates could signal some kind of future turn for the
22:06
GOP after Trump or if it'll just be trumpism all the way down trumpism all
22:11
the way down [Music]
22:34
so we're back you know we keep talking about this job as if it's overtly and
22:41
obviously and self-evidently a wonderful thing that all of them desperately want
22:47
and that may be true but let's explore that a little bit what are they getting out of this themselves and what do these
22:53
potential candidates Risk by taking on such a job I I don't know about you guys
22:59
but I just have this vision of Marco Rubio resigning the Senate moving to
23:05
some Far Away State and then Trump deciding no I'm not going to pick you but thanks maybe next time H yeah I mean
23:13
look the vice presidency has not historically been described as an attractive position and yet lots of
23:19
people seem to want to do the job it's like G I wouldn't possibly want to do that and then when the opportunity is in
23:25
front of you you seize it and I think for each of them there are many many different reasons but I think that a big
23:30
part of this is that the future of the Republican Party feels so up for grabs and you know the person who is his vice
23:36
president could potentially shape what that's going to be but there are many many different possibilities on offer
23:43
here and I think that that sort of speaks to I don't know the sweet generous nature of trumpism um but yeah
23:49
I don't know this it seems like an incredibly unattractive job I mean look at what happened to Mike Pence I mean he you know almost lost his life as part of
23:56
it so but everybody in high level politic you know you hit a certain level and it requires a certain ego and a
24:03
certain delusion that you have answers and gifts that other people don't have
24:08
much like being a New York Times columnist yes exactly real some real similarities um so obviously they all
24:15
think they're going to be different they're going to be the ones to crack the code and without that I'm not sure how they could continue as they go you
24:22
know well and it's not just it's this is again an very unusual situation where
24:29
you're becoming vice president to a term limited president who in the normal
24:34
course of events stipulating that nothing with Trump is normal in the normal course of events becomes a lame
24:41
duck between 6 months and 18 months into his presidency and also he's not really
24:48
interested in the details of governing and I don't believe that Trump is sitting there you know oh he's figured
24:53
out the bureaucracy now he's got a list of 1,700 offices he's going to personally go through and replace no
25:00
Trump even an angry out for Revenge Trump is just not going to care about the details so if you're his vice
25:06
president you are in a position one where you are certainly potentially his
25:12
successor and two you get to run a real part of his White House and yeah the
25:18
Mike Pence situation is it hangs hangs over your head every day but I just
25:24
think for the so to speak but for these guys people who are crazy enough to want
25:29
to be United States senators and president of the United States I don't see how it's a scenario you could turn
25:36
down I think that the great promise of trump is the way that he has reshaped
25:41
the Republican party right and remains to be seen whether this is real but the potential coalition to include certain
25:48
more conservative leaning voters of color this is not a you're just going to hand over and take over the machine I
25:54
mean and you know we talked about this the last time we talked about vice presidents but the person who also fumbled this was Barack Obama right he
26:01
had a very smart VP pick in Joe Biden but then when Joe Biden didn't end up running for president right then it
26:06
turned out the person that he ultimately blessed in the end wasn't capable of picking up and running with the
26:12
Coalition that he had built so I think the question that I have is who among these names is capable of picking up and
26:18
running with the Coalition that Trump has built and can Trump tolerate having
26:24
a person as his number two who is capable of picking up and running with the Coalition that he's built and even
26:30
build on it that's my question for you wouldn't he prefer somebody who would fail just to satisfy his ego as see I
26:38
told you I was the only one who could do this you mean someone who would run after him and lose yeah or I mean that
26:44
just he wouldn't care if they ran after him and lost because that's of no interest to him that somebody else could
26:50
do it or that he has helped the party in some way yeah he has no interest in that he would certainly create a situation
26:57
where whoever follows him will have to endure some sort of humiliating test in
27:04
order to get the blessing from Trump that will enable Trump to claim credit for any victory that we can be
27:10
absolutely certain of I think probably he would still want to beat the you know
27:15
extremist leftwing far-left terrible Democrats hates the Rhinos too right he
27:21
hates the Rhinos let's let's be clear though he's going to be 82 by the time this is all over 're 82 by the time I
27:29
like I'm already 82 I don't know past 82 spirit I think again I think the answer
27:35
is pretty clear that if you were just designing candidates to sustain a more
27:41
downscale multi-racial workingclass trumpist Coalition you would go either
27:47
with Vance or Rubio and I could imagine an African-American candidate who would
27:53
fill that role I don't think Scott is that candidate and you know bergam and stonic they're not inheritors in that
28:01
way but again I think that could make them more attractive to Trump so do you
28:06
think that any of these candidates as vice president could
28:11
signal a meaningful evolution of the Republican party from trumpism or does the mere
28:20
fact of all the Loyalty tests Etc that they have to pass to even get the job
28:26
make that difficult to imagine I think they're fluid enough that they'll pivot again I mean these people are chameleons
28:32
a lot of them he's not picking margorie Taylor green to run on the ticket yeah I think if there's anything we've learned
28:38
from the Trump era it's that many many politicians who you thought were deeply
28:45
deeply committed to a particular ideological profile um discover that
28:50
they have other and more important commitments to their own success I remember a time when I was sure that
28:56
neither Marco Rubio nor Ted Cruz would endorse Donald Trump for president so if
29:02
Marco Rubio were Trump's vice president for four years and then was elected president could Rubio reinvent himself
29:09
as a version of the Marco Rubi of 2016 oh hell yeah AB absolutely the great
29:15
Republican Hope on the Time Magazine cover all over again I mean I think this is a very much as as needs must
29:21
situation and it's very kind of readymade but I can easily imagine a scenario in which Trump chooses someone
29:28
relatively weak and we have a much more wideopen situation in 2028 for the
29:33
Republican nomination which is how he'd probably like it yeah that's assuming he doesn't run for a third term right third
29:40
term coming up baby I can't even think about it let's let's not go doing the third term debate this this time save it
29:47
for the 101st episode Ross you never let me have any fun concluding on the
29:53
malleability of politicians is always a pretty safe bet so let's end there and
30:00
uh after the break we will getoo don't you show
30:11
[Music]
30:24
off so finally it is time for our hot cold who's got it this week all right I
30:30
got it and I'm going to stay political but I'm going to go in a different direction I am cold on presidential
30:35
candidates not making their medical records public or at least coming out with very very detailed doctor's reports
30:42
and this is on my mind this week because of a great piece in the times about how
30:48
RFK Jr has revealed all of these medical
30:54
conditions that he's dealt with over the years including having a dead parasitic
30:59
worm in his head that he says ate part of his brain TMI I'm going to I'm going
31:06
to pause and let that sink in for a while before we also note that he talks about having you know apib and having
31:13
gone through mercury poisoning something about hepatitis from intravenous drug use but he's not releasing his medical
31:20
records we're just supposed to like take that and go okay but come on this is pretty this is pretty amazing right and
31:27
especially given the Kennedy family shall we say longstanding history of not
31:32
revealing serious serious medical problems this makes me more likely to vote for to vote for R it's not a letter
31:40
from his doctor saying that he's the healthiest person ever I want more and he is the best of the bunch that's what
31:46
I'm saying I mean Trump just what was it just a few months ago again released one of those doctors notes that just
31:52
basically you know says yeah he's a great guy and he'll live forever uh I think Biden has released several pages
31:59
of a doctor's summary but so so look I get the logic of FDR and JFK you know
32:07
you want to convey strength and comfort people when you're a sitting president
32:13
but that makes it all the more important that when you are a candidate you just lay it all out there and while I do
32:20
really really appreciate the parasitic worm story I just I need I need it all
32:26
out there for us I mean if that's what he's telling what is he not telling just say I'm I'm sorry RFK Jr has announced
32:34
to the American public while he's running for president that part of his brain was eaten by a parasitic worm I I
32:43
don't I don't think we need I think put the man put the man in the White House
32:49
vote make him president by acclamation I haven't grown up in in subsaharan Africa mostly I have a lifelong you know fear
32:56
of to par itic worms uh just in general so um this has been a tough couple of
33:02
days for me but um I I guess I'd just like to bring us full circle all I want to say is RFK Jr Christy gnome 2024 like
33:12
you know just like the two dream ticket together the dream ticket oh my God
33:17
sometimes the only way to remove a brain parasite when you're out out in the
33:25
prairie and I I just just just for the I I I'm worried some of our listeners you know will think that I am I am mocking
33:33
this I I have spent a lot of my middle age dealing not with brain parasites but
33:39
with extremely bizarre tickborne illnesses right and so I I feel like I have a when I hear this kind of
33:46
Revelation from RFK I don't think this is bizarre I feel a deep a deep kinship like who knows once eating all of our
33:52
brains well that's I want those Medical Records I mean like you can throw that at you can't just throw that out there
33:58
and expect me to go oh cool I want to know more show me the corpse of the
34:04
worm um all right we're going to we're going to um put this episode out of its
