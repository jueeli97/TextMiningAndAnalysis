Texts From the Swamp


0:00
I have spoken way too much about this book I've lost all perspective on what's interesting or not we will ruthlessly
0:06
inform you yeah I I have no doubt I have no doubt so you're a Critic huh I'll show you
0:13
critic not anymore yeah no now now you're an essayist oh God Carlos he's a
0:24
fler from New York Times opinion I'm Michelle coddle I'm Ross D I'm Carlos
0:29
Lozada and I'm Lydia pgreen and this is matter of [Music]
0:40
opinion I want to welcome Ross back from his spring break gallivanting around with the family welcome Ross hi Ross did
0:47
everybody have a good time yes no it was great um I'm still suffering from re-entry problems but I'm sure they
0:54
won't manifest in any way shape or form we'll be gentle and and you can wait until afterwards done here to uh show me
1:01
all the pretty souvenirs you brought me I that's right that's right I brought you nothing but pasta you're so good to
1:08
me perfect but on to today's topic now matter of opinion fans may have noticed
1:14
that Carlos reads a lot and not just the collected works of Jimmy Carter he reads
1:20
Supreme Court rulings commission reports God love him a ton of political Memoirs
1:25
better you than me that's what everyone says but now he has his own book out he
1:31
writes too he doesn't just read he writes it's incredible yes Carlos has
1:37
just published a new book called The Washington book and it is his case for
1:43
why we should all be reading these kinds of things so today he's going to try to
1:48
convince us to care about these documents and after we grill him we'll
1:53
go around and share what texts have shaped our understanding of politics too
1:59
so to get started Carlos my friend State your case why should we read Washington
2:06
so the one thing people almost always say to me when they realize that this is
2:11
in fact how I make a living is some variation on what Lydia said you know thank you for reading all that so we
2:18
don't have to like I'm to be commended for discharging some painful Public Service exactly but I am and have long
2:25
been a believer in Washington books I find them enormously useful for my work
2:32
as a journalist and that's because even when politicians present themselves in sort of the most benign or favorable
2:38
light they still find ways to reveal themselves it could be something Obama
2:43
said to his personal aid on a campaign plane something Vladimir Putin said in
2:48
an essay like 25 years ago I love finding those little details and holding them up to the light and holding them to
2:55
account um I don't say it's the perfect way uh to to understand Washington it is
3:01
my way to understand Washington when I sit down to read a political book I'm skimming it as fast as I can mining it
3:08
for you're giving it I think you you called that the Washington Reed right it's the Washington re but it never do I
3:15
sit down and go by God I cannot wait to tear into the acknowledgments for footnote number 75 I don't understand
3:23
how you do how you even have time to read those things like when you sit down with a stack of like eight books well
3:30
when when you get paid to do it it makes it a lot easier I I want to talk a little bit
3:36
about the thing that everyone says to you better you than me reading all these political books I'm curious how you feel
3:43
about that line cuz it seems to me reading reading and rereading in some cases these essays there's there's a
3:50
pretty sharp distinction between how you talk about a lot of official documents
3:56
or semiofficial documents I'm thinking about everything from Supreme Court decisions to you know
4:03
the January 6th or 9/11 reports the sort of products of committees or official
4:10
governmental statements and how you talk about books by politicians and reading
4:15
it it seems like you might say that there are certain documents that come out of Washington that all Americans
4:22
should read that are worth reading I'm not sure that you feel the same way
4:28
about the political Memoirs that you read I feel like in that case it's more like you are doing us all a favor by
4:35
finding interesting things in them like everyone should not read camea Harris
4:42
and Ronda sanz's Memoirs right it's better to have a Carlos Lozada finding the interesting thing in
4:48
them but they aren't fully worth it and I'm curious if you actually would endorse that view I hadn't thought about
4:55
that distinction that you raise you know I thought about memoirs have thought about official documents but I hadn't
5:01
thought if there was like a clear through line into how I treat them I largely agree with what you're saying I
5:07
do think that things like the 911 Commission report the January 6 committee the Kerner Commission report
5:13
from the late 60s about sort of the racial unrest in America at the time those are vital documents that tell us
5:19
so much about American history and help us understand the place and I do wish those would be more widely read I don't
5:27
think everyone needs to read so help me God by Mike Pence um but that said I I
5:32
do think that there's a lot of utility and at least being curious enough to
5:37
read what someone else says about Mike Pence's book you know maybe if you care deeply about the Trump presidency or
5:44
about the events of January 6 you might be interested in what some of the people who dealt with that day in particular
5:49
have to say you know LZ Cheney's Memoir touches a lot on that Cassidy Hutchinson's Memoir there's a bunch and
5:55
so you know if you care about a certain topic I I think it makes sense to jump into that now now the reason that I
6:01
think I might treat those differently is that the sort of personal Memoirs of of
6:08
politicians often give you insight into the character of a person and they give
6:13
you insight into what that person thinks of you they reveal how they see the
6:19
audience they're trying to persuade of something but those other documents the 911 Commission report and all the others
6:25
they reveal something about the character of the nation and ultimately I think that's a more
6:32
important thing to focus on I really enjoyed so many of the and I read a lot
6:37
of these pieces as they came out um but revisiting them sort of grouped in this way was really fun one of the things
6:43
that really struck me was there's clearly a line between kind of a delicious gotcha like I Unearthed
6:49
something that is a bit of hypocrisy or self-regard or whatever and there's some
6:54
of that uh in one of your essays titled the self-referential presidency of Barack Obama I thought oh you know is he
7:00
being a little unfair to Obama like don't all presidents use their biography as a way to kind of illuminate but the
7:06
essay ends up actually going somewhere deeper so I'd love to hear about that tension between like these sort of
7:12
delightful gotcha moments and like when you know that you've Unearthed something deeper and more profound than just this
7:19
person is a hypocrite or they said something and they they didn't really mean it or whatever thank you for
7:24
seizing on that particular piece that one took me on and off about a a year to
7:30
write I was writing other things but I was kind of thinking about it for a long long time I knew I wanted to to pop it
7:35
sort of when Obama was was leaving office but I'll tell you the origin story of that I was reading and reviewing a different book I was reading
7:41
Michael Eric Dyson's book The Black presidency and I Came Upon just one line
7:48
Michael ER Dyson writes a lot on on race and politics um and he said that you
7:53
know Obama lauded the racial progress that he had witnessed quote in my own
7:58
life substituting his body for our black bodies his life for ours and signal that
8:05
again how his story of advancement was hours and I have here my original copy
8:11
of the Michael ly Dyson book and I wrote in the notes he always does that H about
8:18
everything I wrote in the margins and then I wrote parenthesis fodder for bigger essay question mark and and and
8:25
and Clos it right and then I forgot right and then I just we getting the inside dope here like
8:30
process but I'm saying it's like it can be like one random line in something else you read that suddenly just like
8:35
unveils everything and it was that moment when I realized Obama does this about not just race in America he does
8:43
it about you know using his biography to explain how he'll fix sort of relations
8:49
with the Muslim world or why he cares about America's founding documents because when he was little his mom would
8:54
wake him up to read them to him when they were living in Indonesia you know and it hit me that you could understand
9:00
Obama through this lens you're right that all presidents use biography to
9:06
illuminate their message what was remarkable to me about Obama is that the message and the biography were the same
9:13
thing there was that time during the transition to his presidency when people were complaining that you're just hiring a bunch of like Clinton era retreads
9:21
like where's the Hope in change and he was like I'm the change I I'm the
9:26
message you know I alone I alone it is it is a more benign version of I alone
9:33
can fix it he was the change we were waiting for not we were the change we were waiting for and so sometimes that
9:39
happens when I'm sort of trying to get my arms around a subject and I find like one way that just captures it for me
9:48
okay so there are some of these that it just feels like you had more fun writing than others and we brought up poor Mike
9:54
Pence I have to say I was impressed by the viciousness with which took him
10:00
apart it just felt like you had some demons to work out there and that it was probably a whole lot of fun to write Am
10:06
I Wrong um be honest it's like I never I
10:12
never I don't derive like more pleasure from writing something negative than
10:17
writing something positive about about a book I think that I'm where I dve the
10:23
most pleasure is from sort of revealing something useful about a book something you can take away that then you can
10:29
interpret how you want with Pence there were a couple of things that people
10:35
seized on in that piece one is that you know he spends a lot of time on January 6 where he famously did not move to
10:43
decertify the election you know he went contrary to what Trump was encouraging him to do even when people were calling
10:49
out you know hang Mike Pence and he quotes Trump's video message from that
10:54
day when Trump finally called on the riters to leave the capital and he says
10:59
that Trump said something like you know I know you're hurting I know your pain
11:04
dot dot dot there's an lipsus there but you have to go home now we have to have peace Trump did say all those things but
11:11
I remember when I read it I wondered like what did Pence skip over what was caught in that little ellipses so I went
11:17
to the video you know thank God for C-SPAN and in between there Trump had doubled down on the LIE of the election
11:24
he's like you know this was a landside election we won it was stolen from us everyone knows it Pence skip that part
11:30
so even on a day when Trump did nothing to protect him or to help him he was
11:35
still kind of covering for the boss and I found that I found that remarkable you know to me so much of that vice
11:42
presidency was captured in those three little dots of Pence's ellipses now I have to assume that as you read all of
11:48
these things they then sit there and help you process the new stuff that
11:53
comes out like there was a lot of talk about Trump on the stump last weekend talking about there would be a blood
12:00
bath if he lost and and then there was all this discussion about you know what were this the context of this and I'm
12:08
guessing that from your extensive readings on Trump and the way he
12:13
presents himself which I think was your previous book right I mean you had a you you did a lot of Trump reading that that
12:21
you have a lot of uh material in which to contextualize yeah I I would love to
12:26
hear what you all think of that incident as well Ross if you were blissfully unaware of it dur during your vacation
12:33
even in Italy even in Italy all the way how do you say blood Italian cannot I
12:38
mean I was in the Coliseum at the time you know so so perfect so I I was I was fascinated by the bloodbath controversy
12:45
because I think it captures not just a lot about how Trump speaks and operates but of how people respond to him and
12:51
interpret him so he gave a speech in Ohio over the weekend and he was talking about how he would impose big tariffs on
12:58
you know cars factured outside the United States when they enter the country and he said that that's if I get
13:04
elected now if I don't get elected it's going to be a bloodbath until that
13:09
moment it seemed plausible that yeah he's mainly talking about the Auto industry then he went on to say that's
13:15
going to be the least of it it's going to be a blood bath for the country the stages of interpreting a 30-second Trump
13:22
clip are vast when I first saw it on social media I thought like I I I just saw that if I don't get elected there'll
13:27
be a blood bath and I think like oh he's calling for political violence right then I see a fuller clip and I think oh maybe he's just talking about the Auto
13:33
industry but then I actually sit down and read the words and try to parse the language and I see that I honestly don't
13:40
really exactly know what he means in that moment the words are kind of a mess that's frustrating for me because I try
13:45
to be as precise as I can in interpreting texts and speeches Trump makes that kind of hard but so how do I
13:51
end up processing that in the moment one way is to look back on the things he said before and from his rally in 2016
13:59
when he was remember offering to pay the legal fees for anyone who like got rough with somebody at a with with protesters
14:05
to right now when he's promising to Pardon The Heroes of January 6 who stormed the capital you know after he
14:11
told them to fight like hell to save the country his rhetoric around political violence has been permissive so I can
14:18
hear that clip and be worried I can hear it also and plausibly interpreted as
14:24
like a media freakout especially when there's far more unambiguous material that has said along those kinds of lines
14:31
the last thing I'll say about it and this this gets to the things that that you see in sort of books about Trump that have tried to kind of explore his
14:37
rhetoric and that is that he has a tendency to move back and forth from the controversies that he creates and so I
14:44
this is I hate to make predictions as you know but I would not be shocked if now that bloodbath has entered the
14:52
bloodstream if he would at some point down the line kind of embrace some
14:57
version of it his um of being open to his you know his supporters who just feel very strongly about things you know
15:04
engaging in Acts that that he seems to be distancing himself from now well I
15:09
mean he did give a inauguration speech that described the state of the country as American Carnage he's an upbeat guy I
15:16
don't know I I think to put this in ladan terms the question that Trump raises for your approach to analyzing
15:25
American politics is a difficult one because so
15:30
much of your reading assumes not just that words matter but that even when politicians are writing
15:37
books that are self-serving and effectively propaganda and so on that there is a core there that you the
15:44
Discerning readers can get to and learn something and it's not clear to me that it's always true in general I think
15:51
reading you persuades me that it is true more often than one might think but I think with someone like Trump whose
15:58
whole thing is the gashes ramble joined to the real
16:03
estate developers pitch where words are really just there to sell and you have
16:09
no personal commitment to them you'll abandon them if criticized you'll double down on them if it seems adventti isn't
16:16
that sort of a particular challenge for your kind of analysis that like there is
16:21
no real meaning of certain Trump lines that people obsess over it's all
16:27
contingent and provision and you it's like he's scatting yeah no but he he like deeply believes things right like
16:34
there are some very very consistent through lines of things that he believes and has talked about I mean I share
16:40
Ross's perspective that yes he does present challenges to your method of analysis but there is a kind of
16:46
remarkable consistency um in some things that Donald Trump believes and has spoken about over the years yeah I'm a
16:53
little I I absolutely um agree that that Trump presents challenges to textual
16:59
reading there's no there I mean you know I I don't know how easy it is to be an an originalist when you're looking at
17:05
Donald Trump trying to understand what he actually believes from day one I worry a little bit about sort of
17:11
concluding that well therefore his words don't really matter because they mean something to different audiences and
17:16
different audiences act on them that's why I think it's actually vital to continue interrogating those words but
17:23
sometimes it's not even the word sometimes it's the inflection I'll give you one example has like stayed in my
17:29
head you know forever from the January 6 committee report and that is you may remember Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony
17:36
she was this young Aid in the Trump White House and she was there on January 6 and observed a lot of things firsthand
17:44
and she's describing the moment when Trump is about to give his big speech at
17:50
the ellipse outside the White House and he's upset because there's these metal detectors there and they're not letting
17:57
people through because some of them were armed and so he starts yelling like take
18:02
the magnetometers away let my people in and he says they're not here to hurt me
18:10
that's the quote they're not here to hurt me and of course the moment you look at that
18:16
sentence you wonder what word did he emphasize there's two very different ways to read that sentence if he said
18:23
they're not here to hurt me right if it's hurt then it's kind of benign it could mean know they're not here to hurt
18:29
me they're here to cheer me or support me if he said they're not here to hurt me it's a far more Sinister sentiment
18:37
right they're here to hurt somebody else I don't know which one it is and it was driving me crazy so then I went back to
18:43
see how Cassidy Hutchinson said it in her video testimony and for her it was kind of neutral maybe a slight emphasis
18:49
on the more benign interpretation but like you can have a running transcript of a moment and still not be sure what
18:57
someone means there an ambiguity to text to history that is inherent and that can
19:05
be a source of frustration but it's also just reality and so that's the level of
19:10
granular parsing Carlos that does make me fear for your sanity in the long don't you see how it matters I do I
19:17
absolutely and there well and there's a way and this is where I would plug your earlier book Carlos which was less about
19:24
Trump than about all the ways that people wrote about Trump right is that
19:29
this sort of instability in Trump's own Persona the extent to which people can't
19:35
agree if he's sincere or he's a Salesman or both and so on has then played out in
19:41
these endless iterations of interpretation part of the value of reading all these books as Carlos does
19:49
for us right is that you can understand the effect that Trump has had on our
19:54
society only by seeing not just what he himself has said done but just sort of
20:00
the Endless Hall of Mirrors and so on that goes outward from his own rhetoric
20:06
which is really the sign of a great demagogue well and I I you know I think a sign that we should all be grateful
20:11
that Carlos takes him both literarally and seriously oh I see what you did there nice well done okay let's take a
20:20
break and when we come back we're going to get a little more
20:27
personal [Music]
20:43
[Music] thank you for um taking so much time
20:48
with this book I appreciate it um I wanted nothing more than to have some smart critics kind of pick it apart and
20:55
tell me what I'm really saying and what I really think but now I actually want to um turn it around on you you guys
21:01
always kind of mock me for bringing up books and quoting reports and Jimmy Carter Memoirs and so I want to know
21:09
what are the books or texts that have shaped the way you understand American
21:15
politics all right I'm jumping in here first because I have exactly one and if somebody else claims it then I got
21:20
nothing but I have one book that I return to just randomly it's not on a
21:26
particular topic it's not like I'm doing a piece on Joe Biden in need to go back to the 16 biographies or whatever it is
21:33
the woman at the Washington zoo ah yes see I knew it by the late great marjerie
21:38
Williams who was a writer for Vanity Fair and the Washington Post and she was the master of the political profile she
21:47
could take anyone and make them interesting one of her best ones was on Dick Darman George HW Bush's director of
21:55
The Office of Management and budget like I love that can you think of anything more but it
22:01
was a brilliant profile so tasty so tasty I never looked at Barbara Bush the
22:07
same after I read Marjorie Williams like and the other thing she could do is she
22:12
could take something in public life and mix it with something from private life
22:18
and kind of fold them together in a way that few people can do so like I remember one piece she did when
22:24
Washington had snipers there were these you know two guys riding the suburbs of Washington you probably remember this
22:30
Carlos just picking people off and she was trying to explain to her children at
22:36
the time why it was so scary and this happened to be when she was dying of liver cancer and so she kind of folded
22:44
in the whole concept of Randomness why life's Randomness is just so terrifying
22:50
for people and I actually have tattoos on my arms um that say time and chance which is a quote from Ecclesiastes you
22:57
know time and chance happen to them all but it also was like the last line in this piece that marjerie wrote which was
23:04
just kind of heartbreaking and spoton and so anytime I'm stuck wondering like
23:11
why the hell do I do this for a living I get this book out and remember oh
23:17
because it can be done this brilliantly even if I can never ever approach this
23:23
there is a kind of Washington journalist that's very knowing and canny and and
23:28
frankly cynical about Washington and its personalities and you can use these sort of fireworks writing in that mode but
23:35
they're always felt like something true and authentic and real about her approach and I think the very sad Coda
23:41
to it of course was that she died far too young way too young but she wrote the most amazing essay as she was dying
23:47
and I I just just looked it up because this line has never never left me the image she's writing about anticipating
23:52
death and she said sometimes early on death was a great dark lozenge that sat Bittersweet on my tongue for hours at a
23:59
time and I savored the things I'd avoid forever yeah and it's just this I don't know the image of this lozen and you
24:06
know death as a login amazing um so just an extraordinary extraordinary writer that's a great choice Michelle I'm
24:11
rethinking everything now and I love that it's an essay collection right those those are I did not make that clear yeah like and and you know there's
24:18
as all the best books are right clearly Carlos yes clearly yeah okay lyia what's your pick you know it's funny I um one
24:24
of your essays Carlos is about uh Alexis to teville and reading dville just as
24:29
you were becoming a a US citizen rather rather late in the game I think you you yes 10 years ago just just in time for
24:36
the 2016 election 2016 was the first election I voted in yes yeah and it's
24:41
it's funny I I almost chose teville as my choice because I was born in the United States but spent a lot of my
24:47
childhood outside of it and uh I read um democracy in americ college and I think
24:53
it served a lot of the same purpose for me as it did for you as a as an outsider and oh that's great but I did not choose
24:59
teville as it turns out I actually chose a different book that is not even ostensibly a book about politics and
25:04
it's also not a book about the United States but you know if the question was a book that has influenced how you think
25:10
about politics and democracy and all these kinds of things I think the book that is probably influen you the most is
25:15
Tony juts book post-war which is about Europe from 1945 to essentially the
25:21
collapse of the Soviet Union and the you know the rise of European union and all that kind of stuff and the thing that I
25:27
love about this book is it's not a kind of grand theory of history and like how things unfold it's really a book about
25:33
agency and about how the things that human beings do and the choices that we make are actually what history is all
25:39
about but it's also a book that's about memory and forgetting how you know after
25:45
the horrors of World War II you both had to forget what people did to one another but then also figure out how to come
25:52
together in order to move on and then at the same time build a whole culture out of the memories of what happen so I
25:59
think as an American uh for me I think a lot about our history and the ways in which you know memory and forgetting
26:05
work in our politics so this all sounds very abstract but this is the book that I think has has had the greatest influence on me as as a writer and a
26:12
thinker particularly in this job as a as a columnist so um yeah post war Tony jut
26:18
all right Ross you're up uh I guess I'm going to recommend a genre rather than a
26:24
specific book because I think in parallel to the laadan approach to
26:31
politics where you were looking at either the official work of Washington
26:37
and the sort of inner lives or pseudo inner lives of politicians there's the
26:43
question of how the great and good and terrible American public makes
26:48
Washington do whatever it does that there's an extent to which history is made by the choices of Mike Pence and
26:55
Barack Obama and Donald Trump and John Roberts but there's also a sense in
27:01
which all of those figures are constrained in their decision- making
27:07
channeled and pushed in their decision making By changes in the body politics
27:12
so the kind of books I have in mind are books like to take two examples that
27:17
sort of bookend each other Kevin Phillips the emerging Republican majority written around the Nixon era
27:24
and the emergence of the modern Nixon to Reagan Republican Cod ition and then
27:29
John Judas and Rudy tasher is the emerging Democratic majority written in the early 2000s describing the Obama
27:37
Coalition that was then taking shape and of course what's interesting about those examples is that both are describing
27:44
changes in American life but then are also sort of influencing politicians choices right Republicans could read the
27:52
emerging Republican majority and try and pursue the strategies that Philips
27:58
sketched out and similarly many Democrats read the emerging Democratic majority and it influenced their choices
28:04
I think in certain ways our colleague Tom Edsel wrote a book called Chain Reaction about the transformation around
28:12
race and crime and taxes in American politics David from wrote a couple of books a long time ago one called Dead
28:19
wri about the Arc of conservatism after Reagan one about the 1970s I'm cheating
28:25
I'm I'm going on too long I'm just saying didn't somebody write something called the Grand new party about the need for a different kind of Republican
28:33
that's a different podcast I mean I that that out of the books I've written that was the one that was sort of trying to
28:39
sit inside that genre and and in a way it describes certain Trends I think
28:45
quite prly about how the Republican Party had already been transformed and was going to be transformed but then it
28:51
totally failed to anticipate the actual form that this would take which was
28:57
Donald John Trump but I think that genre is a really important compliment to the kind of
29:03
writing that Carlos does about official Washington I I love all these
29:08
suggestions um I think that's especially interesting at a moment when the country feels very very split and the notion of
29:14
a massive realignment while seductive is is sometimes hard to to Fathom if I can
29:21
cheat I'm just going to say that um one book from the last decade or so that for
29:26
me has been sort of for ative and memorable is a book called the speech writer by Barton swam SW was the speech
29:32
writer to Mark Sanford uh when he was governor of South Carolina including during the famous moment when Mark sford
29:39
disappeared for a few days and claimed he was hiking the Appalachian Trail but in fact he was with his girlfriend in Argentina It's a Wonderful book about
29:46
political rhetoric and SW reaches a really interesting conclusion about this
29:52
idea that politicians are always lying he says one hears very few proper lies in politics ICS using vague slippery or
30:00
just meaningless language is not the same as lying it's not intended to deceive so much as to preserve options
30:05
by time distance oneself from others or just to sound like you're saying something instead of nothing to me that
30:13
that line to sound like you're saying something instead of nothing captures so much about political life and I think
30:19
that's why I try to parse their words and write about their books if the art of politics is to drain meaning from
30:26
language right to produce more more words that say less and less then I think it's a fine mission to try to
30:32
scoop that meaning back up and try to jam it back in So anyway that's what I'm
30:38
trying to do in general and I love that I can hash it out with you guys all right well with that everybody now has
30:44
their reading list go get you copies of all these books uh starting with the Washington book of course available
30:50
wherever books are sold wherever books are sold some places where they even when they're not even when they're not
30:57
like right here in my office yeah that's right you can stop by Carlos's office and pick yourself up a signed copy but
31:03
when we come back from the break we're going to get hot and [Music]
31:26
cold [Music]
31:33
all right guys it's time to get hot and cold but first oh my God Lydia your
31:38
couch segment from last week really hit home listeners sent in dozens of links
31:44
to help you find the non-boring couch of your dreams please tell me that they
31:50
provided some inspiration oh yeah I mean I got so many great suggestions discovered like new local furniture
31:57
stores lanyia but as it turns out um I I happen
32:03
to be in the Burk over the weekend and we stumbled upon a little antique store um and they had a an amazing couch that
32:11
that I bought that is actually older than I am um and um does not look like a
32:17
couch that anybody else has I realized when I was looking I was like I want a couch that looks like it'd be in like
32:23
the office of like a very cool old psychoanalyst and uh and that's exactly what I found well I expect to be invited
32:30
over for drinks on it soonest that sounds fantastic absolutely okay now pressing on who has a fresh hot cold for
32:37
us this week I guess it's me because I was away so I have to bring back Tidings
32:42
um and my my Tidings this is maybe the most Bal and predictable statement but
32:48
so we we were in Italy we were in Rome we took our kids to Europe over the summer so we've been to London Amsterdam
32:54
Paris and Rome with our family in the last year which is not a norm noral pattern just to be clear wow fancy and
33:00
I'm going tol miles I'm going to say firmly that uh that Rome is the best and
33:05
all listeners all Parisian Dutch and English listeners I I apologize but it
33:11
really is the case that the scale of History the different layers of history
33:16
in Rome is without I think without peer even among the other great European
33:23
capitals and so I I guess I'm I'm hot on on Rome well it's hard to argue with
33:28
that and I believe I believe that one of my co-hosts one of our co-hosts here is actually about to DeCamp for Italy
33:35
absolutely doing doing the family trip and so I would have been very bummed if you had if I had been cold on Rome cold
33:43
on Ro Italy's the least interesting country so boring boring actually I did
33:48
a walk at night to a dinner with you know some key Vatican insiders not not
33:54
not really but I did take a long walk through the city at night alone and you know I walked past the spot where
34:02
supposedly uh Caesar was killed which is sort of a semi excavated ruin and they have a couple of what are called
34:08
umbrella Pines planted at the spot and there was something about you know it's midnight in Rome and you're walking past
34:14
these sort of shadowy trees where 2,000 years ago the dictator was stabbed to
34:21
death by Brutus and Casas and you know it's just it's it's hard to beat um it
34:26
also freaked me out a little bit but it's hard to beat all right well on that
34:32
note I will be eager to hear Carlos's trip notes as well but until then I'll
34:37
