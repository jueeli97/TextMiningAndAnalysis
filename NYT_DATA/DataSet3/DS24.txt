Paul Krugman on the Economy as a Voting Issue



0:00
hey Paul welcome Paul thanks for doing this it should be fun you say that now
0:06
but now now Ross behave yourself be nice to the guests please Ross yeah there's
0:11
just mild hazing involved from New York Times opinion I'm
0:17
Michelle coddle I'm Ross doit I'm Carlos loado and this is matter of
0:24
[Music] opinion
0:30
[Music] so our beloved Lydia is out but we have
Guest introduction
0:37
drafted an extra special guest to help us out this week we've been talking a lot about big issues at play in this
0:44
year's presidential election and today by God we're going to try to understand what exactly is going on with the
0:50
economy are we headed into a recession are we just having what all the cool kids call A vibe session what's driving
0:58
public feelings about the situ situation and do those feelings favor Joe Biden or
1:04
Donald Trump now we'll get to politics later but first our times colleague the
1:09
Nobel prize winning Economist Paul Krogan has graciously agreed to step in
1:15
and help everyone especially me make sense of a very confusing economic
1:20
picture Paul welcome thank you so much welcome Paul hi there so we are
1:26
obviously delighted to have you here and my opening question for for you about the economy is am I right to be confused
1:33
are are you confused help me out here I'm actually not feeling very confused
Are you confused
1:39
which is probably a bad sign but um you know basically it's still mostly a story
1:44
of a soft Landing uh that a very rough couple of years mostly As a result of
1:51
aftershocks from the covid-19 pandemic inflation with some bumps pretty close
1:57
to where we wanted to be could there be a recession always that's there can
2:03
always be a recession uh but there's very little hint of one in in any of the the data that we have right now so I'm
2:09
much less confused now than I was a year ago right now the picture looks pretty clear um we had never in my lifetime had
The picture looks pretty clear
2:17
a global pandemic as an economic Factor can you just sort of tell us your story
2:22
about why 2021 and 2022 were so bumpy
2:28
what's what's your story about inflation right now and and and other problems as
2:33
well the main thing that happened so it was you know what in the jargon we call a supply shock but a funny one it wasn't
The main thing that happened
2:41
so much that people stopped producing stuff or couldn't produce stuff what happened was that people changed what
2:48
they bought so that uh you know the elitist kind of classic example but it
2:54
representative people stopped going to the gym and they bought pelons instead or they they stopped going out to eat
3:01
and they bought kitchen equipment instead there was this big shift of demand from in-person services to goods
The economy isnt as flexible
3:08
and it turns out that in the very short run the economy isn't as flexible as all that uh so if people start wanting to
3:15
buy stuff physical stuff instead of in-person services well that stuff has
3:20
to be produced has to be shipped and right at the beginning actually the the
3:26
White House did an analysis back in uh in 2021 just as inflation was taking off
3:32
saying what does this look like and they said this looks like uh the immediate
3:37
aftermath of World War II this looks like the the period when we were reconverting from a war economy back to
3:42
a peacetime economy which was a period of major inflation and that analogy you
3:48
know for a while there's people saying well this is going on so long how can that be the story but in the end uh it
3:54
does look a lot like sort of 1947 48
Why does inflation take off
4:00
but why does inflation take off then as the pandemic ends rather than at the
4:07
peak when everyone's ordering pelons well actually the peak remember the economy was quite depressed and so
4:14
overall spending fell quite a lot during 2020 during the worst of the pandemic
4:20
it's when the economy started rebounding but rebounding in a different way well
4:26
we had 14% unemployment in 2020 and with 14% unemployment it doesn't matter what
4:32
people are buying there's plenty of excess capacity to satisfy it but when when you start getting back towards 5%
4:39
4% unemployment but the stuff that people are doing with their wages is now very different from what they were doing
4:45
before that's when inflation takes off by the way it's I think it's worth pointing out you know we we we're
4:50
Americans we don't believe the rest of the world exists but um the cumulative increase in prices in the Euro area is
4:58
almost exactly the same as it was in the United States so you have a place that you know never had the Biden stimulus
5:05
never had uh a lot of our policies and yet their inflation experience there was
5:10
a little delayed inflation took off sooner and ended sooner you know came down sooner in the US but if you look at
5:16
the cumulative from uh you know January 2020 to January 2024 both sides of the
5:22
Atlantic look the same is your implication then that inflation was more of a a reflection of kind of like larger
How inflation came down
5:30
forces and not necessarily induced by policy moves in the United States yeah I
5:36
mean that's a you for a while there it looked as if that big Biden spending package was a you know driving it and it
5:44
may have brought the inflation forward in time so we had our inflation Spike
5:51
sooner than the Europeans did but in the end uh in particular you can look if you
5:56
look at at how inflation came down it was not at all you know the there were a
6:02
lot of uh economists thankfully I wasn't one of them who were saying we we're
6:07
going to need massive unemployment and only only by throwing the economy into a recession can we bring inflation down
6:14
instead inflation came down painlessly and if you look into the details it was
6:19
very much the parts of the economy where Supply expanded as we sort of worked out
6:26
the The Kinks from the the legacy of Co are the places where inflation came down
6:31
most so it's really consistent with a story that says that these were these larger forces that we probably would
6:39
have had about the same inflation uh cumulatively the timing might have been different but it would have probably
6:44
been about the same whatever the policies had been whoever had been in the white house so to maybe simplify
Wages outpacing inflation again
6:51
things a little bit people are now doing better than they were pre pandemic and
6:56
it seems like after a bout of inflation right the key question is at what point
7:02
do wages start outpacing inflation again because that's the point at which most
7:07
people are going to start feeling like the economy is is doing better is actually improving and there's a lot of
7:13
in the data a lot of different arguments about where we stand with that but what's your view on where where are we
7:19
with that when did wages start outpacing inflation again from your perspective how long have we been have wages been
7:26
growing faster than inflation do you think oh no it's well over a year I mean inflation peaked around the middle of
Inflation peaked in 2022
7:34
2022 and has since fallen off drastically and you really have to torture the data not to find that most
7:42
workers are certainly better off than they were in January 2023 and uh better off by a few percent
7:50
than they were in January 2020 and right now if we're just going to be looking at
7:55
recent developments it's all it's all Sunny Paul you I I wanted to ask you a little a little sort of more more deeply
Covids impact on the economy
8:03
about covid I mean there's been so much discussion about how the pandemic has affected our you know workplace culture our relationships our commutes you know
8:10
um the way we live Etc but what would you say is the kind of lasting Legacy of
8:16
covid for our economic lives not just in a sort of aftershot kind of sense but in
8:22
a more Long Haul kind of sense yeah I mean it's not at all clear there were a
Working from home
8:28
lot of things that people thought were going to be long-term affected they thought that you know a lot of people would uh leave the workforce and never
8:34
come back which has turned out to be basically not true uh the big thing is actually working from home which it
8:42
turns out that enough people like it and enough businesses have adapted to it that that's a permanent change which has
8:48
you know lots of it's probably beneficial for the economy as a whole but it's not beneficial if you know
8:54
you're the owner of an office building is it beneficial just because it's more efficient well the the evidence on on
9:01
what it does to productivity is mixed but um there's a lot of time that people spend commuting that is now saved yeah I
Washing my hair
9:09
only wash my hair when I have to come in and see Carlos so I I haven't washed my hair in six months so it's really
9:16
actually one funny thing is the uh when people did start you know I'm I'm back in some in-person meetings but everybody
9:24
gave up on ties fin the tyranny of the men's ties so over so obviously we're in
Vibe session
9:31
better shape now than a couple of years ago but it's not entirely clear that the public opinion has caught up with this
9:37
yet so where are we in in this so-called Vibe session and by that I mean how people are feeling about the economy
9:44
that's I mean I spending a lot of time on that as I think everybody is reading me knows um and that's a very weird
9:50
thing um you know if you say Americans don't feel good about the economy strictly speaking Republicans don't feel
9:57
good about the economy and among self-identified Democrats consumer sentiment uh which was fairly low when
10:05
inflation was at its peak is right back to where it was before the pandemic among Republicans although it's up some
10:12
in the last few months it's still uh very depressed so people's evaluation of
10:18
the economy seems to depend on their politics instead of the other way around all right so before we get too far into
Break
10:24
the politics this seems like a good time to take a break we'll be right back
10:30
[Music]
The partisan gap
10:47
[Music] and we're back now we're going to take all that information that our special
10:53
guest has explained to us thank you so much Paul oh yeah and debate the politics and I know we all have opinions
11:00
on this one so let's start with the voters why do we think that people on both sides are a little bit pessimistic
11:08
yeah I mean I think Paul mentioned the the partisan Gap in the way we think about the economy and that means that to
11:15
some extent your views in the economy depend on whether your party you know your favored politicians are are in
11:21
office that seems to be stronger for Republicans um than than for Democrats whose views tend to track a little more
11:26
with the actual economic indicators but I think there's a way in which even a
11:33
sort of nominally strong economy can still have you feeling pessimistic I just I mean I just look at my own
11:39
circumstances you know I have a good job with a good salary but I'm scared that
11:44
you know AI is going to kill that good job and that my good salary will never be enough to pay three college tuitions
11:50
that are that are facing me down you know and so I think there there ways in which you can sort of look at at
11:55
positive current conditions and still be concerned about sort of long-term economic prospects and that that can
12:01
Cloud that Vision so the anticipation of trouble down the road so it's not that people aren't necessarily responding
The anticipation of trouble down the road
12:08
rationally they're just looking at the a longer term I'm just saying that those those are rational concerns right
12:14
depending on your time Horizon my last newsletter was called believing is seeing and uh it's definitely the case
12:20
that a lot of Voters perceptions of the economy and of other stuff are very much
12:26
based upon what they think based on their politics should be true rather
12:31
than you know what's actually going on and it's really clear in the economic data it's really clear on views on crime
12:37
now should everybody be feeling happy and comfortable and I'm at no risk no of
12:43
course not there's a I mean could technology come for your job yes of
12:48
course it could I guess my question there is always when has that not been true technology doesn't have to be AI it
12:56
doesn't have to be robots it can be any anything but it's hard to really think that the amount of of risk and
13:03
uncertainty is greater now than it's been pretty much since the Industrial Revolution I mean I think it's worth
People dont like inflation
13:09
speaking up for the theory that I know Paul disagrees with to some extent that
13:15
people just really don't like inflation in a way that lingers in polling data
13:24
and people's perceptions of the economy even after the sort of headline
13:29
inflation rate has come down well historically speaking do we have a sense of how long that
How long does inflation last
13:34
lasts uh estimating lags is one of the hardest things to do yeah in principle I
13:41
you know we we tend to look at inflation over a one-year period and uh it makes a
13:46
lot of sense to think that people's memories extend further back than that not forever I don't think people are out
13:52
there pining for the days when a McDonald's hamburger was 15 cents but the idea that people are still shocked
13:57
at how much prices are up since 2019 I was much more of a fan of that I started
14:04
looking at the consumer sentiment numbers which among those who are
14:10
persuadable those numbers started turning up in the second half of 2022
Consumer sentiment
14:16
before you go further can you just explain the difference for those of us who are not economists the difference between consumer sentiment numbers and
14:22
what we were originally talking about oh okay consumer sentiment you know so the we have various surveys that in one way
14:28
or another ask is the economy good or not how good are you feeling about the
14:33
economy uh we also ask people by the way how are you feeling about their your own finances and there's been a a really big
14:39
gap there if you ask how was 2023 we have uh large majorities of of people of
14:46
of all political affiliations saying okay good or great and if you ask how was it for the country then uh if you're
How is the economy
14:53
a republican you say it was disastrous and there appear to be that a lot of people who you ask how is the economy
14:59
doing and their answer is I hate Joe Biden but for what it's worth among people who are not don't appear to be
15:05
answering that question their assessment of how the economy is what's the state of the economy started turning up in the
15:13
second half of 2022 just as the inflation numbers started coming down
15:19
and you know the argument that says that people care about the level of prices not the rate of change of prices which
15:24
is the inflation rate that has a problem with the timing and um among again I want to separate out a
15:32
little bit but among people who don't self-identify as Republicans views of the economy have improved right in
15:38
tandem with the falling inflation rate so I mean I I it it what what Ross was
15:44
saying is something that I actually uh if if you'd asked me four or five months ago I would have agreed with but I've
15:50
been you know looking at the numbers on what people say about the economy and they don't actually seem consistent with
15:57
that story But but so I'm I'm looking at at Gallup data right now on the the question that sort of tries to unite the
Are you better off than you were
16:05
political and the economic the famous are you better off than you were four years ago question right yeah um and so
16:12
in 2020 not surprisingly When Donald Trump was on the ballot this is pre-co
16:18
right 90% of Republicans say they're better off than they were four years ago
16:23
30% of Democrats so you have a big partisan divide on both sides and 60% of
16:29
Independents say they're better off than they were four years ago Flash Forward to Biden and the partisan numbers swing
16:37
now most Democrats say they're better off most Republicans say they're worse off but for Independence it's 48% saying
16:45
they're better off down from 60% under Trump so you if you take Independence as
16:50
a kind of control group and obviously they lean left or right but some of them are swing voters they do seem unhappier
16:57
right now than they were in 2020 and if it's not inflation we need some explanation besides Fox News for why
17:05
those voters are sour on the like how has Biden done question I mean do we
Independents
17:11
think people are just sour in general because they have a pandemic hangover well I I talk to political scientists
17:18
and they you ask them about independence and they say they they basically don't
17:24
exist that uh the great bulk of people who say they're independent are are
17:29
really strongly partisan leaners either Democratic or republican uh there's a only a small segment of the population
17:36
that's truly independent and if we ask why independent voters are down on the
17:42
economy well think of the independence as being half Democrats and half Republicans and we know that these
17:48
partisan effects are much stronger for Republicans than they are for Democrats they exist for Democrats but the
17:53
independent number is going to be somewhat depressed because the the people who say they're Independents but are really Republicans are going to be
17:59
much more passionate in in being negative about a Biden economy than the The Independents who people who claim
18:06
they're Independents but are really Democrats it's not clear to that that's additional information that doesn't make that does not explain the wild swings in
18:14
Joe Biden's approval rating in 2021 in the first year of his presidency he had
18:19
approval ratings consistently near 50% and today his approval ratings are much
18:25
lower and he's losing to Trump which he never want was in the polls in 2020 so even if you say the number of Swing
18:32
voters genuine swing voters is really small still there are clearly some
What should the President do
18:37
genuinely unhappy swing voters whose unhappiness will determine the outcome of the next election yeah which brings
18:44
me to the question of this kind of pessimism does tend to come back on whoever is in charge so what do we think
18:50
the President should be doing about all of this as he goes into this very tough
18:55
race yeah the short answers is uh why should I know uh but look I what I think
19:03
is quite possibly true is that there is a hangover of of discontent uh
19:11
reflecting not just inflation but just in general the the pandemic was an enormously disruptive event I don't know
19:18
if there there's a formula I mean it's there are some people on the left who say oh Biden shouldn't talk about how good the economy is because there are
19:24
lots of people uh who are still poor and suffering you know that's always been true and if a Democrat can't run on his
19:31
record because we aren't Utopia then that's a that's a council of complete
19:36
political despair um they can try to talk it up but I don't know I mean if I
19:42
had to say the the thing that most amazes me about the current state of
19:47
political debate is the way that uh most of 2020 has been kind of vanished down
19:53
down the memory hole you know people talk about all the the great job market under under Trump but you know that he
20:00
was the first president since Herbert Hoover to leave office with fewer Americans working uh than before so
20:05
people sort of say it's as if history stopped in January 2020 and and uh
20:11
everything after that is not his fault but somehow all of the pandemic related
20:17
stuff that continued after Biden came into office uh is his fault I I just
Public expectations
20:22
wonder that one one way to maybe square that circle is that you know the the
20:27
pandemic and 2020 was a shock to the system and perhaps that is one reason
20:35
why Trump would get somewhat more of a pass than when Biden comes into office a
20:41
year later um you know already kind of knowing that that's what he was going to be facing so perhaps the the standard
20:49
can be higher than for the president who is surprised by the event along with the rest of us yeah I wonder how much of
20:55
this is public expectations on kind of what the timeline for return to normal would be and that obviously was on
21:01
Biden's watch Mostly yeah we were all I mean everyone was surprised by you know
21:07
there was within the economics there was team transitory versus Team permanent
21:12
and at this point it looks like team transitory was right but transitory turned out to be 18 months not 6 months
21:19
and um what I think you can say is that it may be true that people saw the
21:25
pandemic as a global event out side the president's control they don't see the
21:34
inflation uh that happened afterwards as a global event outside the president's control even though if you look at the
21:41
numbers it was but you know how many ordinary Americans are looking at European inflation statistics so uh I'm
21:48
not sure that we really know in in these days what to make of any of these things
21:53
I mean again I talked to political scientists and they've been saying you know presidential approval just doesn't mean what it used to mean because we we
21:59
now have such hard partisanship that the presidential approval is remarkably
22:06
insensitive to developments in in the world um so we really don't know what to
22:12
make of this and anyone who thinks that we can predict the election based upon polls right now is in for a tongue
22:19
lashing if you talk to any actual serious political analyst Paul I want to I want to take you for a second in the
Age of Diminished Expectations
22:25
in the Wayback machine here and um you wrote a a book in the 90s called the age
22:31
of diminished expectations yeah um which I read in graduate school and um and I
22:37
if I remember it correctly you you wrote that even during periods of sort of broad economic expansion the economy is
22:44
just not delivering the kind of progress that Americans had taken for granted in the past you had people feeling worse
22:50
off than their parents fearing their kids be worse off than than they were um when you think about that sort of these
22:56
these three decades lat later what are our economic expectations like now well
23:03
I wrote that book you know in 1989 believe it or not so it's you know it was I read one of the later editions you
23:10
you kept updating it it was a different world yeah um when I was writing that book the big story was that uh we had
23:17
all this fancy technology you know uh personal computers um were still new and
23:24
trendy uh but it wasn't showing at all in economic performance then you know
23:29
we've actually spent the last 15 or so years in another period when we have all
23:35
this fancy technology that doesn't seem to be delivering a whole lot in terms of people's living standards uh so I think
23:42
people are feeling sour I think at some level people do look and say you know I have all this technology that my parents
23:49
didn't have why am I finding it so hard to buy a house where is the the American
23:55
dream which is partly just Nostalgia and again just want to come back and say that that this is a we're just a far far
24:02
more divided Society than we were and it's a lot of the negativity comes from
24:09
people who don't like where the country has gone politically culturally rather
24:16
than a response to sort of concrete conditions so wrapping all of this together I mean do we think that this
Trump or Biden
24:22
economy as an issue is going to favor Trump or Biden in this election I mean
24:28
my my thought is it's going to be Trump just because it always comes back on whoever's in charge it it it could
24:33
benefit Trump in the way that you say Michelle I also wonder to what extent we think that that partisan Gap in in
24:40
perceptions of the economy is sort of immovable or if a sustained you know
24:46
period of several more months of you know positive economic outcomes could
24:51
could put a a dent in it in in which case you know it's by the time November rolls around and people are voting you
24:57
could see a a strong economy benefiting Biden I guess I don't know what sort of
25:02
economic growth how strong does the economy have to be to overpower the partisan lens through which voters look
25:08
at the economy I have a actually almost exactly opposite take uh which is that
Will the economy matter
25:16
right now if you look at who thinks that the economy is bad it is basically
25:21
committed Republicans and they're never going to vote for Biden regardless and there's been a big
25:27
improve movement in perceptions of the economy among Democrats which might mean that it actually doesn't matter at all
25:34
that that nobody's going to move on this uh and it it might mean that some people on the fence will in fact notice an
25:40
improving economy and and go for Biden but my personal guess is that the
25:46
economy will actually altogether be less of an issue in this election Than People imagine that it's going to be decided on
25:56
enthusiasm turnout out uh driven largely by uh non-economic issues all right so
Its not the economy stupid
26:03
Paul's a vote for it's not the economy stupid right you know Democrats have been doing really really well in special
26:09
elections but that's not because people voting in Queens or whatever are feeling
26:15
good about the economy it's because the non-economic issues have actually been playing in democrats favor that people
26:23
are being turned out by roie Wade and they're being turned out uh by fear of
26:29
authoritarianism this is not this is really you know it's the economy stupid that was
26:35
1992 and 1992 was a long time ago it was really a very very different country and
26:42
uh since then the economy has mattered it seems to matter less and less for the election all right Ross you want to have
Ross
26:49
the last word on this one yeah I mean I'm I'm a vote for the economy matters we don't know for sure why people
26:58
again not just Republicans are unhappier with the condition of the country than
27:03
Paul's analysis of where we are economically says they should be but I still think the way to bet is that if
27:09
you have you know 6 months of a booming stock market stock market hasn't gone up
27:16
much under Biden now it's going up um 6 months of wages continuing to outpace
27:21
inflation 6 months where inflation actually gets down to where it was
27:26
before Biden which it hasn't yet then that helps Biden win you know there
27:31
there are locked in coalitions yeah of 40 to 45% of Americans but just in in
27:37
both 2016 and 2020 you saw real swings of different constituencies and again it
Biden
27:44
it matters on the margin but I think that happens again whereas if inflation starts creeping back up I think that's
27:51
really really bad news for Biden's re-election campaign so you're a it depends no I'm no I think
27:58
it depends but I think that if you take Paul's understanding of where the economy is right now and you project It
28:05
Forward you just say it continues for six more months I think you would bet on Biden winning reelection one thing I'll
28:11
say is that um even when it was the economy stupid it wasn't really the economy stupid in '92 if you remember
28:18
the full slogan in the in in the war room with uh you know carvill and
28:23
Company it was three parts it was change versus more of the same the economy stupid and don't forget about Healthcare
28:31
so even then it was it was multiple multiple things that they were they were focused on and um and I think that's
28:38
that's still the case can I ask one more question well I guess you can now Paul I
Inflation
28:43
just want to ask about America's fiscal capacity meaning how much money we can
28:49
spend in the future without running into inflation again because it seemed to me like one of the big lessons of the
28:56
entire Obama era where I think you know you you were consistently arguing that
29:02
America could get away with a lot more deficit spending than a lot of conservatives and Republicans and even
29:08
Democrats thought and that seemed to be true throughout Obama's presidency and throughout Trump's presidency um but now
29:15
in the co era we spent a ton of money we got inflation back and I'm just curious where you think that argument stands Can
29:23
America take on more debt in a Biden second term in a trump second term without just
29:30
having inflation immediately come back whether it's via new spending or tax
Debt
29:35
cuts okay I don't think inflation is the issue the question uh now is is there a
29:42
limit on how much debt the US can run up we are running persistent deficits uh
29:49
the the level of debt relative to GDP has been rising and is now at its
29:55
highest level since uh the end of World War II and and it's one of those things
30:00
where you look at it you say well this can't go on forever on the other hand you look at the history of advanced
30:09
countries borrowing in their own currencies and you find that it is really impossible to find any example of
Aging Population
30:17
a country hitting the wall and so there is an issue that we have a an aging
30:23
population uh that we made a lot of promises to people are at or approaching the age of eligibility for Social
30:30
Security and Medicare and and at some point in some sense we have to find the
30:36
resources for that but it really doesn't there's not a hint in Market reactions
30:42
not a hint in international history um that we're anywhere close to hitting
30:47
that Breaking Point okay so listeners we'd like to hear from you on this so please tell us how the state of the
30:54
economy will affect your vote and why leave us a voicemail at

31:07
times.com so let's take a quick break and when we come back we're going to get hot and
31:13
[Music]
31:26
cold
Hot Cold
31:36
and finally it's time for some hot cold where every week one of us shares something we're into over or somewhere
31:42
in between so who's got this week it's me I was going to say something about
31:48
being hot for showing kids old movies meaning from my perspective movies from
31:55
the 1950s 1960s and 1970s but actually what I'm hot for is using old movies to
32:02
acquaint your children with the harsh realities of aging and mortality in
32:08
recent days we have showed our kids a couple of movies the man who would be king uh the rard Kipling adaptation with
32:15
Shan connory and Michael Kane great movie and the even better movie Bridge on the River Quai from 1957 with sir
32:23
Alec Guinness I should say also a great movie and in both cases our kid's previous exposure to Alec Guinness was
32:31
of course as Obi-Wan Kenobi right in Star Wars and to Michael Kane was as
32:36
Scrooge in the Muppet Christmas Carol and so in each case we basically rewound
Alec Guinness and Michael Kane
32:42
the clock on those actors and my 11-year-old daughter just sort of stared
32:47
in horror and shock when she realized that the voice of Alec Guinness as you
32:52
know the middle-aged 40s something British officer was also the voice of the Aged Obi-Wan Kenobi and and Michael
33:00
Kane our kids basically think that Michael Kane is like you know the biggest Global celebrity ever because he
33:06
was also a voice uh I think he was a voice he was a no he was a voice in Cars
33:12
2 where he was a British secret agent right so he's he's everywhere you showed
33:17
them the famous uh you know Michael Kane impersonation that impersonation contest is glorious Michael Kane no no that's
33:24
not Michael Kane we've been doing uh Cold War movies at home so recently the
33:31
murrian candidate Doctor Strange Love war games oh war games yes it's
33:37
excellent um so that's been our kind of you know dip into old oldish movies it's
Rumple of the Bailey
33:44
funny cuz we've been taking a bit of a Time trip as well streaming Rumple of the Bailey I've never seen that well
33:50
we've had fond memories of it you know once upon a time watching it again two things one God Britain was a lot more
33:59
British than careful careful Paul you know it's just the the whole culture
34:05
seems far more alien uh than you know modern Britain does to an American and
34:10
second maybe it's it is getting older and I turned on the closed captioning oh
34:16
yeah cuz I was having a little trouble understanding you know all of this uh received pronunciation is actually
34:22
harder to track than it used to be but actually in a way it's a demonstration of how homogenized Global culture has
34:29
been because I think Britain and America are a lot more similar than they used to be H all right well on that
34:35
International note I think we're going to call it for the week Paul thank you so much for coming to help us out thank
