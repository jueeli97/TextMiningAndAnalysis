Picking a Trump V.P.: The Field of Dreams or a Field of Nightmares?


0:03
from New York Times opinion I'm Michelle coddle I'm Ross D I'm Carlos Lozada and
0:08
I'm Lydia P Green and this is matter of [Music]
0:21
opinion my friends it is election go time we are rolling into the last
0:27
weekend before gaggles of Iowa Republic an gather at their caucus sites to kick
0:32
off the actual voting in this year's presidential race it is time for real
0:38
live voters to start having their say Real Americans oh wow as the resident political junkie I am absurdly excited
0:46
despite not being a fan of the Iowa caucuses per se but I need to know has anyone else here spent them some quality
0:53
time in Iowa I saw Field of Dreams a couple of times no that is not the same that's that's about it that's as close
0:58
as I've come to Iowa as careful listeners of this podcast know I'm from Minnesota but I have
1:04
nothing to say about Iowa I think I've been there once oh my God Ross I have been to political conventions all over
1:11
this Fair country but I have never been to the Iowa Caucasus I am the only one to be lost in an Iowa cornfield so
1:18
Michelle what's it what's it really like I am not a fan of the caucuses I have to say I have a loud critic of the process
1:25
and of having one state be the first off the line every sing single year it is a
1:31
bizarre and fascinating experience and I would love to sit here and pick it apart
1:37
all day long but we cannot we are going to look oh well no no I not going to get
1:45
bogged down in the field of dreams I am going to look farther down the field and
1:50
we're going to talk about vice presidential picks oh so the field of nightmares the field of horror the Field
1:58
of Dreams you can barely remember right come on do not roll your at I love this
2:04
whole selection hubub because even though the job of vep is so wretched and
2:10
thankless that there was an entire HBO series devoted to it who a nominee picks
2:17
as their running mate is really important it tells us a lot about their strategy and State of Mind where they
2:22
think they have weaknesses who they want to woo on and on and on and on so first
2:28
we're going to dig into this process and then we're going to make our cases for
2:34
who the presumed Republican front runner one Donald John Trump ought to go with
2:40
as his next running mate and you will note that I said front runner not nominee yes it's not over but still so
2:46
to start us off I want to know what do each of you think a nominee should be looking for in a
2:52
VP uh three things someone that will help you win someone that will help you
2:58
govern and someone that can do the job if you croak oh Professor Lozada like
3:04
that's it but no but the thing is I think candidates worry far too much about the first one right who will help
3:09
you win forget about the second one who will help you govern and don't really care about the third one someone that
3:15
can do the job if you croak because they won't be around anyway they don't about croaking you're saying that our
3:21
presidential contenders aren't such civic-minded Souls that they don't
3:27
imagine America going on after they're passing can't imagine America without them I think the last two factors the
3:33
someone that can help you govern and someone that can do the job if you're incapacitated are probably most important but there is a logic to caring
3:39
most about the someone that can help you win side as kind of mercenary as it seems I mean it doesn't matter if your
3:45
VP is really good at running the country if you don't win in the first place well L do you want to pick apart one of those
3:51
pieces since Professor lzada has gone broad yeah I mean I it's funny as we were as we were uh
3:59
was doing some reading and and thinking uh before this episode and I realized that all of my perceptions of the vice
4:05
presidency have been so deeply influenced by the way the vice presidency is portrayed in popular
4:11
culture and when I was trying to think about like oh do I have a favorite like historical vice president I realized
4:16
that I didn't but I do have yeah well no but I mean I obviously have favorites of
4:21
the fictional portrayals and basically like the two sort of modes in which the vice president is portrayed in popular
4:28
culture and here I'm talk about TV and movies not books cuz books as we know are Carlos's thing not any of the rest
4:33
of us so we're not allowed to read so if there are literary references you come back with them but they're basically
4:39
either complete bumbling idiots in the mode of Selena Meyer from the show Veep or they're these like absolutely
4:46
makavelian schemers who like want to bring down the main guy you know when I
4:51
was thinking about what the vice presidency is for for Hollywood it seems to be for like making the president look
4:58
good so maybe that's ultimately what it is right you want somebody who's going to like make you look good Ross caros do
5:04
you have a real life favorite VP you'd like to throw into the mix here I mean I I think that the under
5:13
Carlos's rubrics the most successful VP pick of
5:19
recent years is probably the man who's president now Joe Biden the evidence
5:25
that any VP pick obviously helps you win is is usually negligible VP picks don't
5:32
seem to have a huge effect on the race but Biden was a case where Obama was
5:37
clearly choosing someone for sort of Outreach purposes the kind of you know
5:43
white moderate Catholic older welln super well-known guy someone who would
5:50
be presented as at least somewhat reassuring to various kinds of Swing
5:55
voters in a way that like a lot of VP picks haven't really been like Dick Cheney was not an Outreach pick Pence
6:04
kind of was right no Pence was a Shore up your base pick Pence was a yeah I think Cheney and Cheney and Pence both
6:10
Outreach to different kinds of people well there I don't think Cheney was an Outreach pick at all he was supposed to be Shoring up the Republican
6:17
establishment's Comfort level with a governor who had no experience those people were going to vote for Bush 100%
6:24
no matter what I think Cheney was a pure governance pick but even
6:30
Pence there were a bunch of Republican voters especially Evangelical voters who were just not sold on Trump and Pence
6:38
was for them with yeah with a touch of you know here's a sort of more normal politician for the swing voters but if
6:44
you were really going for swing voters you would not pick someone as you know deep dyed Evangelical as Pence I don't
6:52
think camea Harris was an Outreach pick camela Harris was a your base demands an African-American woman at this moment of
6:58
racial Reckoning pick so it's actually unusual that Biden was an Outreach pick he was also a governance pick and I I
7:05
think we have evidence from his own presidency as well as from the Obama era that he is better at legislative deal
7:12
making than Obama ever was so he was effective on that front and whatever you think of his presidency he has gone on
7:19
to be president right so he sort of he can conceivably govern can conceivably conceivably be president and and has
7:26
been so I I think that's that's the closest we get to the trifecta in modern
7:32
American history I don't know what do you guys weird Obama Obama kind of went I mean went with him in part because he
7:37
didn't think he would run for president later yes right like he was like he won't be distracted by like trying to
7:43
run later on you know yeah thought he was going to follow the chy promise that was true it did happen in 2016 it's true
7:50
that he didn't want the vice president to have a sort of separate political agenda he didn't want the Machiavellian
7:56
schemer and he got that Biden did not like plan and execute a presidential
8:02
campaign while he was vice president the way everyone from Richard Nixon to alore
8:08
has had to do he did it later well and and I think like him not running for president had a lot to do with his son's
8:15
death and you know things like that like I don't think that it was a fat compete that he was never going to run for office after Obama's two terms the other
8:21
thing that's striking about the Biden pick in reference to the current situation and the probable Republican
8:26
nominee is that Biden said some not great things about Obama right what do
8:33
you mean he called him clean and articul what wrong with that complim
8:38
having having having received many many compliments of that type over the course of my life I can tell you they're
8:43
extremely flattering that is sarcasm you're detecting but I think that that was clearly intentional and I think that
8:49
choosing someone who you know maybe sort of like made a little stumble around race was a way of kind of opening up the
8:56
field I'm I'm just sort of furthering Ross's Point here but I I do and we'll talk about this later I do wonder if
9:01
that's going to be a uh a part of of the strategy for the Republican nominee well
9:08
picking somebody who tends to be unifying is one way that you can go other ways are traditionally and this
9:15
one has always seemed like a stretch to me you pick somebody from a swing state you pick geography so that maybe you can
9:21
capture their state or as we've been talking about you pick somebody who really appeals to one segment of your
9:28
base like Kam black women or evangelicals Mike Pence and the
9:33
traditionalists do any of those strike you as a better bet than others or are
9:39
they just all pointless and we should just acknowledge that this is all a game they're semi pointless I mean I I think
9:46
it just depends on the presidential candidate you can see why Biden who sort of backed into the nomination by being
9:54
sort of the safe moderate consensus Choice when other candidat Ates had been competing for the activist left would
10:02
feel like he needed something potentially base energizing now whether anyone was actually energized by Harris
10:09
is a separate question but but you could see why a figure like Biden would worry about base energy whereas you could see
10:16
why a more ideological president would worry about sort of Outreach or safety I
10:22
mean George HW Bush who Ronald Reagan picked in 1980 that I think more than Cheney in 2000 that was the pick to sort
10:29
of reassure Suburban establishment Country Club Republicans that this
10:35
California right- Winger was still going to have some of the old Spirit of Nelson
10:40
Rockefeller and Gerald Ford in his administration and that that made sense I think I like it when they're sending a
10:47
generic Vibe out there or a specific Vibe out there you know like with Al Gore on the ticket with
10:53
Clinton it '92 they really wanted to Telegraph new day new generation new
10:59
excitement whatever and even to some degree Al Gore who was always slammed as extremely cautious extremely
11:08
boring or whatever he took a bit of a risk putting Joe liberman as a historic
11:13
first Jewish guy on the ticket trying to Telegraph that I'm not as predictable as you think I am now I don't know that
11:20
liberman was necessarily going to excite anybody but they try these things Jo come
11:25
on fantastic people I think the man pick was effective and and it also
11:31
telegraphed specifically separation from Clinton because liberman had been a
11:36
prominent a moralist a moralist and critic of Clinton and yeah the Clinton Gore race that was the rare Double Down
11:43
Choice yeah it would be if like if Trump had picked n Gingrich which he was considering as his running mate it's
11:49
like you like me you can have more of me all the way yeah that's go well because there's the partnership model which is
11:56
kind of this doubling down and the balancing model The Scholar Elaine kmar has written about this you can do
12:02
balancing right like you know Massachusetts JFK picks Southern LBJ
12:07
conservative Southerner adds Midwestern liberal with Carter and and Mondale but then like Clinton Gore Cheney Bush Obama
12:15
Biden those are much more in the like partnership models where you actually gave your vice president more not just
12:22
like funerals and trips to countries no one cares about you know like actually a partner in governing the the G graphical
12:29
model also belongs to an Era I think where America was less ideologically
12:35
divided and more geographically divided and as ideology has replaced geography
12:40
the idea that picking a southern politician gets you Southern votes has diminished well talking about the real
12:47
partnership model I mean that that brings the question of how has the job itself evolved or been redefined in
12:54
recent decades I mean you can start with anyone you know like Dick Cheney of
13:00
course is the regarded as the strongest VP possibly ever but but Carlos you have
13:06
mentioned a little bit about how the job has changed how do you see it you know
13:11
um the journalist um Jules Whit cover wrote a book about the vice presidency
13:16
something like from irrelevance to power or something like that scintilating story of my life he said from I think
13:23
got you got that backwards right but he said you know he pointed out like the the typical is that with Gore the role
13:31
of the vice presidency became more more substantive and then cheni took it up a notch up several notches it's actually a
13:38
great moment and I think it's something by by Len Kar where right after Bush and Cheney you know took office Quail came
13:45
to visit Cheney to kind of like tell Cheney what the vice presidency is all about oh sweet Jesus right Dan Quail you
13:52
know George HW Bush's vice president potato Fame and he was like you know lots of travel he had been to like a lot
13:58
of of countries didn't matter that much and Cheney just listened very politely and said the president and I have a
14:03
different conception of what this job is going to be so sorry getting back to irrelevance to power right Jules Whit
14:09
cover said that the moment when VPS began to be taken more seriously was
14:15
with Truman after Truman came in and suddenly he was read in on like all this
14:21
stuff he had no idea about including like the atomic bomb program and you know stuff where he had not been really
14:28
up to speed the UF the UFO recovery program really there you go there you go
14:34
you know and then he's like and since then presidents have at least made an effort to keep their their VPS far
14:40
better informed but you know what's what's interesting to see I think is the
14:45
kind of vice president that presidents who used to be vice presidents themselves select oh and I think they
14:53
often select kind of weaker VPS George HW Bush picked Quail yeah wait I want to
15:01
jum here Biden picked Harris right I think that Richard Nixon picked sparo
15:07
Agony I want to jump in here though and defend Dan Quail which like whoever does
15:13
that at the time and I remember where I was when my parents staunch Republicans
15:20
were talking about how excited they were that George HW Bush who is this boring
15:25
weenie of an older you know kind of upper crusty guy had picked this young
15:30
exciting Heartland guy to be his number two no in this is kind of an OB lesson
15:37
and how things can go very badly wrong but at the time George HW really needed
15:43
a jolt of excitement and that's what Dan was supposed to supply he was not
15:49
supposed to become the butt of jokes and not know how to spell potatoes or whatever so I just want to stand up for
15:56
Dan I mean he's speaking as someone who literally suggested that John McCain
16:02
should pick Sarah Palin in 2008 I I know brother I don't believe I'd admit that I
16:08
know where it was a jol it was a j listen I I speaking of political
16:13
conventions I remember getting on the plane from the Republican convention the
16:19
night after Palin gave her first big speech which was a huge hit and some
16:24
nice liberal Democratic woman was on her cell phone in the row in front of me she was like I can't believe they're going
16:30
to do it to us again there was 48 hours maybe even 96 hours there when Sarah
16:37
Palin was the best vice presidential pick anyone had ever made and oh my God
16:42
and on that note I can't think of a better way to say I could see Russia
16:48
from my house no but the the Palin nomination in
16:54
hindsight is really really significant in American politics right like like it's interesting we've been talking
17:01
about the vice presidents who won right about the the winning tickets Palin is
17:06
one of is perhaps you know this is also recency bias but Palin may be one of the most consequential losing vice
17:12
presidential picks in recent memory in part because she legitimized a kind of like protot Trump style of of politics
17:19
that would come to dominate the right Palin Palin was like John the Baptist to Donald Trump's like orange Jes why must
17:26
no do not bring God into this pick that V pick feels really really consequential
17:31
oh no no on the no we are cutting this off because Carlos has brought the Bible into Sarah Palin discussion we were
17:38
going to take a break Sarah Sarah would do that herself were she were she with us and that does not make it right on
17:45
that sacriligious note when we come back we're going to take a look at the folks auditioning for that number two slot I
17:51
had a whole thing about how Jimmy Carter picked Mondale I me I brought his White House Memoir you did not bring the book
17:58
Jimmy Carter went through you know what I'm going to smuggle it in to the next segment Jimmy Carter went through a fantastic process wait save it save it
18:05
save it save [Music]
18:22
it all righty we're back we have chewed over what makes a good vep candidate and
18:28
a not so good one now we're going to start naming names and here I feel like I need to throw in the caveat that the
18:34
Republican nominee has not been chosen it ain't over the fat lady hadn't sung y
18:39
y y but the GOP base loves its some Trump and he has been dominating the
18:45
primary for months so we have to prepare ourselves emotionally for the strong possibility that he is going to be on
18:51
the top of the ticket and for obvious reasons he will not be bringing Mike Pence along with him this time as his
18:58
dance partner so with the understanding that nothing is definite we're going to assume Trump is going to be the standard
19:04
Bearer and we want to talk about who we think he's going to tap as his understudy this time well that was a
19:10
heavy sigh from Carlos when you said we're going to assume that no I just Carlos no no no I'm I'm I'm GNA cheat
19:17
I'm G to cheat far be it for me to get into the head of of Donald Trump it's a very turbulent place but but listen all
19:23
I can do I'm going to lay out like just a few of his Tendencies and then you can me figure out who fits that bill right
19:30
like I don't think he's going to pick someone who sees himself or herself as an obvious Heir Apparent as as the next
19:37
president maybe president someday but not the next one Trump sees himself as president for all eternity I don't think
19:43
he wants anyone who's already as Ross mentioned running the shadow campaign second I don't think he wants anyone
19:49
who's like a really big personality he has to be the alpha in the room so I don't see like Marjorie Taylor green or
19:57
Carrie Lake it's got to be someone who was on board with stopless steal someone completely completely loyal about 2020
20:04
election fraud claims he feels he got screwed with Pence he doesn't want that anymore and his final thing what's the
20:10
thing Trump always likes someone who looks the part Central Casting Central
20:15
Casting so an attractive woman or a strapping man you know like I think that's what he wants so who's that vend
20:21
diagram your first thing has ruled out everybody there is no person who could be picked by Donald Trump at moment who
20:29
would not see themselves as the president four years hence that person does not exist yeah but they can less
20:34
Telegraph it than others yeah I think that's everybody looks in the mirror and sees himself as president Ross do do you
20:40
Michelle everyone who would be considered for a political ticket I don't I don't I wasn't born here I mean
20:46
I think Ross is the only one Among Us who probably he's been mentioned I'm sure he's been mentioned Vice Roy I see
20:51
myself as a vice Roy that's right that's right Catholic Imperium magga King not for R Us Vice Roy of New Spain
20:58
all right stop I need to hear what Lydia thinks so I think that Trump is in
21:04
survival mode and I think that his path to survival is through winning the presidency so in this current political
21:11
climate winning the presidency will require something very different from what it required of him last time he
21:17
chose Mike Pence who was Shoring up the base and you know reassuring evangelicals he doesn't need to do that
21:23
now they're all on his side so if Trump were like a rational actor who was like I want to stay out of jail in my way of
21:29
staying out of jail is becoming president again which you know a big if turns out I think that actually might work for him but that wouldn't have been
21:35
my sort of strategy to stay out of jail just in general but but you know let's just go with that to each his own you start from where you are Lydia exactly
21:42
um but if his goal is to actually win the presidency then there's really only
21:48
one person he should pick and that person is Nikki Haley I don't think that he necessarily will pick Nikki Haley but
21:54
the argument for it is I think uh and pardon the pun impeachable like if he
21:59
wins the nomination what's he going to need to do he's going to need to reassure people who are on the edges of
22:06
his political Coalition that he's okay and I think Haley helps him Telegraph
22:11
like I'm okay normal people want to be around me and want to be part of my
22:16
Administration if you consider Nikki Haley normal I think it could really help diffuse abortion as an issue
22:22
because I think the two of them together could say look we agree with the Supreme Court that this should be decided by the
22:27
states you know they could also change their minds later and that would be fine uh because that's the way that our politics works there's a question about whether
22:34
she would actually take the role but I think no there isn't yeah I mean she's like a craving OPP th% no question about
22:41
whether she would take the RO doesn't the Bas hate Nikki Haley I don't think it matters the bass hates n up but they
22:49
love love love Donald Trump they don't matter I'm assuming that you do not agree with this no I I completely agree
22:55
with Lydia do you I mean not no I I don't com well you think that's who he's going to go with not who he should go
23:01
with no I think I think it's it's an airtight argument thank you Ross for Val I think I think I think it is a strong
23:07
argument I don't think it's like one you know not like take it to the bank but but yes Trump has always liked One
23:15
getting people who have been his Rivals to bend the knee now this is like a complicated situation where Haley bent
23:21
the knee and then broke from him and you know she'd be bending the knee again up and down but but that's fine right part
23:28
of trump always wants to be in the good graces of the mainstream media even
23:35
though that's sort of hard to imagine from his actual behavior that that is still there in him he definitely wants
23:41
to win the election the fact that he picked Pence as opposed to one of his flunkies and Toadies and yes men even
23:48
though Pence you know sort of remade himself as a yes man showed that he can think strategically about these picks
23:55
and you know there might be someone else in the kind of like you know establishment moderate Zone besides
24:02
Haley but Haley is the one who has Brand recognition at this point and also people like I would not be reassured by
24:09
Trump picking Nikki Haley I haven't written my anti- Nikki Haley piece yet but um I give us a preview PR I mean I
24:17
think I think Nikki Haley is a dangerous warmonger who would you know bring some of the worst Tendencies of George W
24:24
Bush's presidency into an Administration that she inuence dick Chen and heels as
24:29
they um I'm not going to you know I'm not going to you're not going to par it vivc I'm just saying I would not want us
24:37
foreign policy in Nikki Haley's hands at this particular juncture in history that that is my concern but none of that
24:43
would keep Trump from naming her I endorse Lydia's logic so this is the window into Trump's thinking that I am
24:49
fascinated by because I agree with all of that logic that said I'm also
24:55
interested in how it butts up against Trump's loyalty issues and there is there is a difference between kind of
25:01
mildly annoying him and say running against him as Ronda santis can tell you who has become you know Public Enemy
25:07
Number One of sorts in Trump World also there's the possibility that she
25:13
would outshine him on certain occasions which he cannot abide also the Mike
25:20
Pence pick may have convinced him that he should just tell everybody to S off
25:25
who wants him to go in the Strategic Direction because that was such a disappointment to him he went with Mike
25:31
Pence when he didn't want to because it was the smart thing to do and he wound up with somebody who wouldn't overthrow
25:37
the constitution in his favor or an election and I I don't know how on
25:43
balance this all comes out so while I completely think your logic is what the
25:49
smart way to go is I don't know if Trump is just so confident in his like
25:55
glorious popularity that he's going to say screw it and go with somebody he prefers like Christy Nome the governor
26:01
of South Dakota so make that case yeah who's on your list yeah if he I mean if he doesn't go with Nikki Haley then I would think he would go with somebody
26:07
more like South Dakota governor Christy Nome who has been a hardcore early endorser been lobbying for the job hard
26:15
attractive media Savvy woman no loyalty questions there you know she once gave
26:20
him a replica of Mount Rushmore with his face added in for God's sake she knows how to stroke that ego well I think I
26:27
mean the other question with Trump is to what extent does he want to be engaged with the day-to-day of running his
26:34
presidency in the second term cuz cuz who he P right now did he want to be
26:39
engaged in the first term no well exactly not he was he was clearly not super excited Super motivated by it so
26:46
it was helpful to him to have a kind of Heritage Foundation approved vice president and in his second term if
26:54
there is one he's going to have a thinner bench of experienced people to draw from to staff
27:01
his administration so who he picks as vice president is sort of going to be a big signal in a way it'll be a signal to
27:09
people who would be on the fence about taking a job in the administration in the first place whether they should come in to me the issue with a pick like
27:17
gnome or Sarah hakabe Sanders Carrie Lake you ran through Michelle in the P
27:22
She Wrote about this a number of sort of Mega friendly female politicians the issue with a lot of those figures unlike
27:29
Haley is it's not clear like who they're bringing in to sort of Staff a second
27:35
Trump term whereas if Trump's view was I'm going full populist full magga in
27:40
the second term but I want a vice president who will be focused on all the
27:46
policy I don't care about I think the natural pick for him would be JD Vance yeah I think there are various reasons
27:52
why that might not happen but someone like that there there might be other figures like that who are who are I mean
27:59
there's another one that we haven't got into which is Alise stonic who has been debasing herself pretty significantly to
28:07
wipe away all of her kind of moderate sins from early in her early in her term and is very Trump loyal and has a lot of
28:13
establishment ties and a lot of experience with leadership on the hill exactly no that's true and stepanic
28:18
unlike Vance doesn't have any kind of sort of policy portfolio or Vision but
28:24
she would be able to say to Trump I can manage the hill for you yeah and I don't know that Trump wants a policy portfolio
28:31
I mean he has his vision of of whatever and there's no indication that he wants to be a policy president so I I'm not
28:38
sure that Vance brings that much that Trump wants he seems to care so little about governance that I can't even
28:45
imagine that he would pick a vice president on those grounds yeah he would say like well I'm not really that
28:51
focused on governance I'm more the figurehead but I need someone to be you know worrying about how to pass this legislation like I don't I don't think
28:57
he sort of views the presidency that way like well but if I think we're giving him way too much credit here think he
29:03
cares about winning I think he cares about winning cares about winning because he's always cared about winning
29:08
but he also he sees winning and he may be right about this as a way to get out of it's his get out of jail free card
29:14
like I mean this is a guy who's got legal hounds at the door at at multiple doors into his many doored Mansion now
29:21
here's here's a question off of that though who among these folks I assume
29:26
every one of them would take it which means that on balance they think even what happened like does the Mike Pence
29:32
example not disturb any of these folks I mean risk of death is part of being in
29:38
politics right I mean it's a no I mean not specifically about getting hang it it is high risk in a way that obviously
29:45
a more normal vice presidential role isn't but it's also a rare case where
29:51
you'd be joining a president who would be a lame duck like you know well I I
29:57
know probably there is the like Trum Trump is going to be a dictator and you know run for a third term and so on
30:03
scenario and I'm sure we'll get to that in a future episode assuming for the sake of argument that Trump is in fact
30:09
not going to be president three times then as soon as he's elected you know
30:16
we'll be starting to talk about 2028 and the yeah whoever is his vice president
30:21
will have a unique well no I mean yeah he may sabotage that person but they will still have an opportunity most vice
30:29
presidents come in and it's like eight years to go till you can be your own person that's not going to be the
30:35
scenario here at all I know but I do Wonder like he so hates the idea that he
30:40
isn't singular he would legitimately sabotage kneecap his own
30:46
vice president just to prove no one else could do it that is true very early in a
30:51
second Trump Administration he will begin the drum beat that he should be
30:57
allowed to run for another term because his first term was sabotaged and
31:03
Toro AB by the Mueller investigation by all the rest so the first term doesn't count and like like this is not I'm not
31:10
I'm not being funny like this is like the most predicable thing in the world but also like depending on how things go
31:16
at the Supreme Court he could dispatch SEAL Team Six to assassinate his vice president if they got to no that was not
31:23
of the Supreme Court no I I know I'm saying that that it eventually that argument will eventually be made to the
31:29
Supreme Court which hopefully they'll reject I think the Seal Team Six scenario is best saved for a future episode all right fine fine fine okay
31:37
you guys you guys are better at predicting I just I I can't imagine Nikki doesn't fit any of the qualifications that I I laid out um I
31:44
can't imagine JD Vance but Carlos then who is he picking who do you want Carlos
31:49
who pick your qualifications you can't just do that you can't shoot down Nikki and then say I don't no but here's what
31:56
Nikki for first of all Nikki wants to be president would be running for president immediately y Nikki does not pass the
32:02
Loyalty test and if you read um the divider uh by Peter Baker and you saw
32:07
that he didn't want Nikki a secretary of state because he didn't like her complexion she didn't look the part I
32:12
don't think he think she looks the part of a vice president like all the all the petty Trump reasons go against Nikki ha
32:19
I agree but the most Petty Trump reason of all is survival um and and winning so
32:24
that's you know my QED if Haley wins New Hampshire and there is more of a Live
32:30
presidential campaign between her and Trump that could dramatically change the
32:36
calculus I think it's worth just throwing it's early it's early we could save this for a future episode but uh I
32:42
I think uh some wild speculation on who uh Nikki Haley or or Ronda santis would choose as their vice president would
32:47
they choose Trump hey I'm all about wild speculation bring it on babies there's a
32:53
moment when I will I will share with you how Jimmy Carter picked Walter I just I
32:58
it just kills me your will come Carlos your your day will come it is not going to be today all right we're going to
33:05
leave it there and when we come back we're going to get hot and cold oh God it's really good I should tell you
33:25
sometime all righty friends it is that time of the week when one of us gets our
33:31
temperature taken which sounds way weirder than I me to not but who's going
33:37
to get the hot coal this we um I am I am a hot little potato this week see Go
33:43
With It C with with an e at the end alternate spelling potato thank you Dan Quail so first of all um I just I have
33:50
to start with a question what were you all doing Monday night of this past week
33:55
oh God I know where this is going Monday you see I like a like a real American oh
34:00
you were watching football was sitting on my butt with Tostitos and salsa watching the college football national
34:07
championship pulling for Michigan no I was not pulling for Michigan um as a as a proud graduate of the University of
34:14
Notre Dame and a devoted fan of the Fighting Irish I officially hate Michigan um but I still congratulate
34:20
them on their Victory Hail to the to the cheaters so go um shots fired I used to
34:26
teach a class for the Michigan and Washington program I have lots of former students who are Michigan alums and they're terrific but um all that to say
34:33
is that I've been a college football fan for about more than three decades now and in that span I have been subjected
34:40
to super weird and super random ways to determine who won the championship that
34:46
year when I first became a fan you know we had the bowl system and different conference champions have to play in
34:52
different bowls which meant that sometimes the best teams wouldn't play each other at the end end of the year
34:57
and then you know the Associated Press poll told us who the winner was right which struck me as a little absurd then
35:04
it got worse then there was the Bowl championship series which was this complicated formula that um would spit
35:11
out who were the top two teams at how to play each other at the end of the year wow then it got slightly better but
35:17
still bad when this secretive committee gathered and every week released a poll
35:24
of you know the the top 25 teams and in the end the top four teams would play in the semi-finals and then the two winners
35:30
in the final so I am C on all of those prior systems and I am reasonably hot on
35:37
a new system that will begin next year which is the four team playoff is being expanded to a 12 team playoff that still
35:44
involves you know the conference champions and still involves the rankings but will give 12 teams a chance
35:51
to compete for the championship at the end this may be partially colored by the fact that Notre Dame has a better shot
35:58
um getting in a a 12 team playoff I will I will admit that with all these weird
36:04
things happening in college athletics these days I am actually somewhat
36:10
cautiously optimistic hot on the 12 team playoff that will begin in college
36:15
football next year ask me in a year if I still feel that way can I can I ask can we ask them to sort out the uh way that
36:22
we elect presidents cuz it sounds like it sounds to me like like the Electoral
36:29
love to see stick to sports there you go there you go guys I'll see you on the other
36:36

38:10
Carlos you have been so patient would you like to give us your story about Jimmy Carter picking his
38:16
VP so um why yes I mean thank you I don't I don't know how you how you realize that so I I recently read I'm
38:23
holding it up now I know this is audio but it's such pretty blue keeping faith
38:29
uh Jimmy Carter's uh presidential Memoir it's it's the worst of his many Memoirs but anyway Jimmy Carter explains in
38:35
great detail how he picked Walter Mondale hashtag Minnesota Pride for Lydia um and it's a really good process
38:43
so first of all he's you know he was a governor so he realized I need someone with Congressional experience so he
38:49
started going through Democrats on the hill he said if he had his brothers he just would have gone with senator Frank church or or Senator scoop Jackson
38:56
because he was comfortable with them he wanted to cast a wider net so he and his staff looked like 20 different people
39:02
they they ranked them and I'm going to tell you how we rank them by their leadership ability their voting record
39:08
their attractiveness not physical their attractiveness two key constituency groups among whom I needed help uh their
39:14
campaign Effectiveness their experience where my own was limited their geographical strength the overriding
39:19
consideration was how a person could perform the duties of President he came up with like a bunch like John Glenn Ed
39:26
musky ad Stevenson Pete Rino and Walter Mondale eventually comes down to musky and Mondale and he chose Mondale in fact
39:33
because Mondale had a really good pitch mandale came down to Plains and said here's exactly how I want to make this
39:40
job be useful to you and productive for the country that whole thing struck me
39:47
as just a very sensible reasonable wide- ranging process didn't go with his
39:53
initial gut looked around found someone he was comfortable with with wait car Carlos I is that the
40:02
story Ross that's that's the I mean I love you I love you no it's it's a story
40:08
we like brothers and as your brother I'm going to say it's a process that story did not live up to a processed person
40:15
expect have you not been listening you're all you're saying is that Jimmy Carter ran a really responsible vice
40:21
presidential that's the story that's what thrill why is that wrong he got down on
40:27
his knees and the Lord Jesus appeared to him
