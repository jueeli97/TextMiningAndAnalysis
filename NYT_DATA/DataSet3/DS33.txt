Swiftonomics, Kamala Harris and Decadent Real Estate: Your Questions, Answered.


0:00
my general position is a lite refusal to engage with AI generated art until it
0:09
fools you exactly right now one of my three co-hosts is actually an AI
0:14
generated version but I don't know which I don't know which one nobody knows which one I think that's the plot of
0:19
Blade Runner from New York Times opinion I'm Ross DED I'm Michelle coddle I'm Lydia P
0:27
Green I'm Carlos Lozada and this is is a matter of [Music]
0:40
opinion so it's a very special time of the year it's the holiday season for
0:45
those who celebrate Christmas Hanukkah K Quanza festiv Us St rest festiv us for
0:52
the rest of us um and it's also the last of our episodes for the year of Our Lord
0:58
2023 three and in the spirit of the Season since we love our listeners we
1:04
asked you to send us what you want to hear us talk about for this episode from
1:11
episode ideas to sort of quick hot cold reactions to things that all of you put
1:18
forward and so we're responding so we're going to start out in the first segment with quick reactions and I think we're
1:25
starting with a voicemail so let's hear it I'm Joe I'm 22 I'm from Minnesota and I
1:33
actually went to one of Rock's talks when I was a student in college I was actually in a Monk class I was on a silence so I'm wondering um if you guys
1:39
are hot and cold on aestheticism um and I'm just wondering if you guys meditate or exercise or how you selfcare all
1:46
right thank huh wow wow wow I wonder he was meditating during your class during
1:52
your clearly clearly he abandoned the monastery way to go Ross you drove him
1:58
out another failure um so who has a take on asceticism hot or cold I can jump in
2:03
on asceticism weirdly um Joe from Minnesota says that he was on a vow of
2:09
silence when he was in your class which is why he couldn't complain and I it was in speaking engagement not
2:16
a class Carlos wow well so aestheticism aestheticism is a sort of intense
2:23
self-discipline and self-denial relating to sex and food and other Indulgence
2:30
right is that is that is that a fair description um often often religiously based um but you know speaking of the
2:36
vow of silence I actually in the late 90s when I was a we lad I did a silent
2:42
retreat at the Abbey of Gethsemane in Kentucky which is where Thomas meron the famous trapis monk uh spent so much time
2:50
he called he called it the four walls of my new Freedom which was just a wonderful description um that's in the
2:56
seven story Mountain um I sort of cheated during the silent Retreat because I would go into the library a
3:01
lot and listen to the tapes of Merton's sermons so it was it was silent in terms
3:07
of my speech but not not in terms of my you couldn't talk well it's like hearing you can hear preaching on a silent
3:13
Retreat I think that's I think but so I I think I'm I think I'm hot on aestheticism as as weird as that sounds
3:20
I'm so hot on aestheticism but in the kind of meron way I think in the it's not I don't think he thought of it in
3:26
terms of restricting your body from pleasure but giving over your will to
3:31
try to live life in imitation of Christ which is how he saw it so it's a lot more to it than just like giving up
3:37
chocolate for Lent I mean I like it theoretically but I don't have the time or brain space I it's just like this is
3:43
that's the whole point to give yourself the yeah well who's who's going to pick up the pieces of my life while that
3:49
happens that's my question the Lord our kids uh some of our kids school
3:56
uh does some sort of semi secular meditation uh and my son who is a big fan of all
4:03
forms of warfare he's s years old you know at one point one of his grandparents heard about this and said
4:09
well what do you you know what do you think about when you're meditating and he he looked at her and he said weapons
4:15
boom dropped the mic so all right let's do another one let's hear it hi there my
4:20
name is Olivia I'm a college student in Baltimore I would love to hear your take on Taylor Swift and her economic impact
4:28
her social impact now what you guys think love your show um okay so I am a fan I I'm into
4:36
Taylor love Tay folklore got me through the pandemic like she's made some fantastic music she's times person of
4:43
the year she's on the cover and like I'm here to call it enough maybe Taylor could like take a take a break you know
4:50
like this is just like oldfashioned Milton Friedman supply and demand economics but I feel like I worry that
4:57
we're we're teetering into overs supply of t and and and maybe she could tighten up Supply and and increase demand see I'm
5:04
I'm completely in disagreement with this I inrease demand you increase the price when you TR
5:10
Supply Carlos Carlos are you perhaps a professional Economist are you a trained econ might you have worked for the FED
5:16
at some point yes talk to us about Swift nomics no no no no no I have I have nothing to say on Swift nomics and I I'm
5:23
with Lydia okay Michelle has we need the pro tailor take no I'm I'm totally Pro
5:29
Swift omics people have broken down not just kind of what her tour contributed
5:34
to her Pockets which I'm all about you know girl power you go you you rake in that money baby she has created a
5:41
product that people are dying for and that's great but it also has been estimated that she contributed like 5.7
5:48
billion to the US economy when you factor in travel and hotels and food and
5:55
merch and outfits and all these like screaming swifties um I'm fine with this I don't see any
6:02
problem with it you know it's not like she's selling drugs so onward this one
6:07
is a reader email from Matt and he is asking about the Las Vegas
6:14
sphere the huge venue slash it's not a
6:19
dome I mean it's a sphere right Rising above the strip and he asks is it a Gody
6:25
isore operated by a malignant businessman that is wasting
6:30
insane amounts of energy and money or is it a testimony to Humanity's Ingenuity a
6:37
brilliant Act of anti- decadence I think Matt might be pushing my might be
6:43
pushing my DEC Buton I I don't know anything about the Las Vegas sphere but I will say there is a lot of room
6:49
between a Gody eyesore and a brilliant Act of anti- decadence there's a lot of
6:55
space in between there is there it's it's a tribute to man enduring love of
7:00
spectacle it's like you know it's it's our Roman Coliseum H maybe it's a brilliant Act of God eyes plus when it
7:06
turns into an eyeball it is so freaky has anybody been to it have you seen it in person or is just just experienced it
7:12
virtually no I've not been to I know lots of people are going to the YouTu con I'm in Vegas every weekend so
7:17
obviously Ross has a little gambling Ross a roulette oans 11 was actually about me
7:23
um the Julie Roberts character was based on my my work I'm no I'm honest torn I
7:29
mean I think in general under my definition of decadence Las Vegas is inherently decadent that like no matter
7:36
how awesome you make Vegas this sort of simulation of great human landmarks
7:42
dedicated to casino gambling it can't escape decadence but I will concede that if something in Vegas were to escape it
7:50
would be something as Brazen and balls out absurd at the sphere it's at least
7:55
not pretending to be something else it's not a fake pyramid f is a really weird
8:01
sphere you're tipping me towards anti- decadence yeah all right um let's move
8:07
on to our next which is I guess a surprise from our producers oh dear that
8:13
we're just going to play I'm afraid terrifies me hi it's your producer
8:18
Sophia um and I have a hot cold for you based on something I have become quite
8:24
cold on this year which are self checkouts um I'm often not going to self
8:30
checkouts anymore and preferring the human contact at a grocery store but I
8:36
think about this in the larger span of this year where there's been so much talk about the Doom of technology and Ai
8:43
and so I'm wondering what piece of technology you are now called on um
8:49
going into 2024 well that was the best question we've had so far I can't even answer it
8:55
such a good question um who's got who's got this one Carlos you hate all technology what do
9:01
you got well you know it's funny because you're right I do hate all technology but I kind of love the self checkout
9:09
that's cuz you hate people even more in the hierarchy of phobias the worst
9:15
technology is is the human I kind of I kind of love the self checkout it's I
9:20
don't know how meaningful the human interaction is that I attain in the
9:27
checkout line so I I am not anti self check I I am lukewarm on the self
9:33
checkout has anyone turned on a piece on a piece of tech I mean I I've done a real 180 on on social media um you love
9:41
it now I love it now no you know like I recently left uh I recently left Twitter
9:46
and I think like maybe for the last time although I'm against definitive declarations you're cold on I think this
9:51
was this was the year that it really turned for me and I was like you know what I'm I'm peace out I'm I'm no longer doing this and I'm I'm on some of the
9:57
other the other platform forms but in a much more dister way but I'm I'm actually grateful for that I'm I'm glad
10:03
that it doesn't doesn't give that dopamine hit in quite the same way taking back your brain my terrible
10:09
realization is that actually Elon musk's algorithm works on me the For You tab
10:15
where he just sort of delivers curated tweets to me about you know collapsing fertility and Lord of the Rings actually
10:21
keeps me scrolling and more I hate myself for it but it's it's the reality
10:27
all right Let's do let's do one more more voicemail hi everyone this is Pete
10:32
from Minneapolis Minnesota I'm calling to see if you are hot or cold on making
10:39
statements it seems that whenever there's a major event most recently with Israel and Palestine individuals and
10:46
organizations are compelled to come out with a statement and I think there's more than just moral showboating here I
10:52
think there's something deep in our psyches As Americans as members of a democracy that makes us think our
10:59
individual voice can turn the mammoth carriership of history and affect social
11:05
change and that in the face of Injustice somehow we not powerless to make a
11:10
difference that's pretty fascinating and something I would love to hear you all talk about thanks for the show and I
11:16
look forward to hearing more bye the MTH carriership of History these motans this
11:22
is great warms my heart I I feel like they're all showing up up Lydia my people are showing up yeah so here's the
11:28
thing that was such a good question that I think we need to go more than just quick hot cold on it so I'm going to use
11:34
that as a moment to say thank you to Joe Olivia Matt and Pete and especially our
11:43
producer Sophia for your hot and cold suggestions and we'll take a quick break and be right back to talk about
11:49
statements stay with [Music]
11:57
us
12:15
[Music] and we're back and we'll try and answer
12:20
some of your questions both Broad and even personal uh but let's start with the last listener voicemail from before
12:27
the break which asked us about making statements the pattern of every major
12:32
American institution from Ivy League schools down to your local Progressive
12:38
daycare issuing you know a statement after any event of national import what
12:43
do you guys think about this I'm serious that obviously they can
12:49
do this I'm sure some of them feel compelled to do this but you're just asking for a world of hurt do I really
12:56
need to know if the guy who sells me my big goal what side of the Israeli Palestinian conflict he's on do I really
13:03
need to know you know going bigger if the people who make my car what their
13:09
political positions are or how they come down on these no no I don't I just think
13:14
that that is going to land them often in the middle of a giant poop storm and
13:20
they're just asking for more trouble than it's worth well I I think what what
13:25
has happened to a lot of Institutions is that there was this period basically from you could say the
13:32
election of Donald Trump onward when there was a set of political issues
13:37
where the sort of Center left and the further left liberals and progressives
13:42
were very United and so all these institutions that were themselves mostly left of center felt really comfortable
13:50
having a kind of corporate institutional opinion on what was happening in the world and what we've seen lately with
13:56
Israel and Palestine is that it's soon as you get an issue that divides a lot of Centrist liberals from
14:03
a lot of progressives these institutions have a big problem because everyone is
14:09
mad at them for either making a statement or not making a statement or being too pro-israel or too Pro
14:14
Palestinian and it seems like the answer is just a sort of beat a strategic Retreat from this pattern of statement
14:21
making but once you've established the pattern if you try and beat a retreat it looks like you are you know copping out
14:28
and showing bias or favoritism or what have you I mean I'm generally I generally
14:34
think that like stay in your lane um you know and of course we are all paid to write our opinions so it's easy for us
14:40
to be like stay in your lane because like this is our lane we write our opinions we make statements you know
14:45
wait you guys are piding and boy we take a beating for it though um but it's interesting you know like when I was running a small podcast company with a a
14:52
mostly Progressive staff during the the the George Floyd protests and all of that kind of stuff and it wasn't so much
14:59
a need to make public statements because the you know our parent company Spotify did most of that and you know the public
15:04
statements were quite sort of anod and you know doing things like turning the album covers black you know things that
15:10
were just gestures rather than actual action um but the way that I responded to it was like to actually just kind of
15:16
like write letters to the staff about what I was thinking and feeling um and you know it's funny I've actually never
15:22
thought about this but I think that writing those letters to the staff was actually part of what convinced me that I wanted to be an
15:29
colist cuz I enjoyed doing them you know and and they were they were they were personal and they were like you know I
15:36
know you know it wasn't I feel your pain it was like here's how I how I'm thinking about these issues you know um
15:42
so these weren't public statements but it was just sort of me talking to a very you know amped up and emotionally upset
15:49
staff about a range of issues um and that that to me felt like a like a normal and natural thing to do in a
15:55
small institution uh but these big institutions with their big public statements no thank you what what I will
16:01
say about about these statements is setting aside editorial boards for
16:08
whom this obviously does not apply um institutional voices are usually less
16:14
interesting than individual ones and especially statements that are issued in
16:20
in the middle of very contentious political debates um have a a sameness to them that is that is kind of
16:26
deadening you know it's it's the same reason that I that I really don't like open letters open letters that have been
16:34
uh written by sort of very prominent and talented writers almost always are the
16:40
worst thing they will ever write the least interesting kind of writing that will ever be produced is that appears in
16:46
an open letter so the the kind of drab sameness of the statements and the you
16:54
know very unpersuasive low quality of the writing makes me um in the in the anti-stat camp
17:02
I'd much rather hear individual pieces or individual expressions or individual statements
17:08
than than any of these institutional or Collective ones you object to the Aesthetics I I would only lary quality I
17:15
would only qualify that analysis by saying that there is a kind of perverse
17:21
pleasure to be taken in reading the statements put out where it's clear the school has no idea what to say and
17:29
they're trying to use that kind of anod predictable language not to sort of make
17:36
an anod point but to make no point at all and there is a kind of you know Las Vegas sphar like Majesty that some of
17:43
these statements achieve they a brilliant Act of anti no it's it's a brilliant it's a reach anti decadence
17:50
all right let's dive into some more um listener correspondents so Todd wrote us
17:57
an email um to bring us down into the muck of presidential politics people my
18:02
people Todd Todd asked vice president camea Harris was nowhere to be found in
18:09
the episode we did where we designed imaginary presidential tickets so why
18:14
not Harris as part of anyone's dream matchup well
18:20
Todd when you have a politician who is even less popular than the president
18:26
that everybody is worried about in many polls even Democrats are talking smack about her she was a mediocre candidate
18:33
in 2016 such that she dropped out pretty early and she has not dazzled as VP
18:38
which admittedly is a hard job to Dazzle in it is worth a bucket of warm pea um
18:45
it's usually not good to staff a dream ticket with those kind of stats so you
18:50
know even if you think even if you think KLA has done a better job than she's getting credit for if you're Staffing a
18:57
dream ticket she's not going to make the cut I will I will follow up on Michelle here and I think if none of us mentioned
19:04
kamla Harris it's because none of us find her worthy of being on our Dream
19:10
ticket but the um I read her 2019 Memoir the truths we hold and there is this one
19:16
thing she did that kind of bothered me a bit and that has affected the way I I
19:23
view her when presented with a difficult conundrum between two eting ideas she's
19:29
like oh that's just a false choice you know she writes uh it's is a false choice to suggest that you have to be for the police or for police
19:34
accountability I'm for both you know I'm not for American citizens and against immigrants um or the other way around
19:40
I'm for both she constantly brings up this idea of of false choices and of course it sounds very sage and wise to
19:47
call something a false choice but politics is all about making difficult choices among competing priorities and
19:53
Harris seems to want to stay on both sides of difficult questions which made me instinctively not
19:59
trust her as a president or vice president but there's an interesting way in which like what's Downstream of what
20:07
there right like I remember when Barack Obama was sort of emerging on the national stage and um sort of casting
20:14
himself as you know a new leader for a new generation and I think in The Audacity Of Hope and sort of things he
20:22
wrote and said around that time he did a version of that right he said you know I'm a Democrat but the Republican to
20:28
write about some things and he did some of what maybe she's trying to do she just she doesn't carry it off she has a
20:36
problem as a candidate lyia what do you think well I mean I think like I'm I'm probably the most sympathetic to to
20:43
kamla Harris um among this group in part because I think it's a very difficult
20:49
and tricky thing for a black woman of her generation to um find a a place of
20:56
equilibrium within politics and you know she's of a generation that came into politics via law enforcement which is
21:03
kind of a tough fit in figuring out how to how to make that work with the current dynamics of the sort of
21:08
progressive uh side of the democratic party that that whose support she would need in order to kind of like really
21:13
really volter forward I think that you know black women often need to be just much much much more careful about how
21:20
they manage their emotional energy um in how they present themselves so I I I I I
21:26
look at kamla and I see a lot of things that I deeply understand of you know a
21:31
woman of a certain age with a lot of talent working within a culture that has
21:37
certain expectations and um so I'm I'm sympathetic um all of that being said um
21:43
she's she still doesn't make my dream ticket all right let's uh let's go to the next question which is Jerry
21:49
listened to our recent Election Day episode and wants to know why are journalists still so interested in polls
21:56
have you not read James fow's critique that's my former Atlantic colleague and
22:02
distinguished journalist and critic of the press uh his critique of journalists fascination with polls so what do what
22:09
do we think are journalists still drunk on the polling Kool-Aid I guess you don't get drunk on Kool-Aid
22:16
so depends on how much sugar there is in it I can tell Lydia has much to say Lydia I can't I I mean I am going to
22:23
take a slightly I mean I have an enormous amount of respect for for Jim Fallows he's an extraordinary journalist and his positions on these things I
22:29
think are sometimes flattened and and charactered in a way that isn't actually true I mean I think that um as a
22:36
journalist I always want to have more rather than less information and the question is what do you do with that information how do you analyze it what
22:42
weight do you put on it so to me polls are just another form of information um and the reason you started doing you
22:47
know polls is because understanding what large numbers of people say is really useful to um getting a sense of like
22:54
what's going on out there in the country and there are lots of problems with it and you know particularly now with like cell phones and who actually answers
23:00
their phones and all that kind of stuff there are issues um but uh coming back to Jim fellows he has this line where he
23:07
says that we should think of polls as climate versus weather which I think is actually a really useful thing uh
23:12
weather is like is it going to rain tomorrow and if your if your poll is like is so and so going to win or is so and so up or down um that's actually not
23:20
that useful but if you think of it as a more kind of like this year is going to be hotter than any year that we've had
23:25
in human history then that that way thinking about polling is is actually more useful yeah so I'm going to take
23:32
Lydia's brilliant reference to the climate versus weather uh analogy as a
23:38
bridge to the next question which is from Rebecca who emailed us because she's interested to hear how we think
23:44
about parenting in the age of climate crisis she writes not so much in the
23:49
sense of how to talk to children but how to be an adult handing off a world in so
23:55
much trouble to younger Generations I like it best when the four of you get into ethics and questions of how to live
24:01
and think about right and wrong in this very confusing time now I have strong
24:07
feelings about this idea of the climate crisis as sort of this special challenge
24:13
to Parenting um my general View and one I'm coming to this as someone who does
24:19
worry less about climate change as an existential threat to humanity than some
24:26
people do so obviously the more existential you imagine climate change to be the more worried you will be about
24:33
what it means for your kids but my general view is that the human race
24:38
depends on people having children and making optimistic decisions about the
24:44
future and having hope for their children even in the face of the various
24:49
inevitable calamities to which human beings are air and that if you know
24:55
climate change presents a set of real and substantial problems to our civilization at the same time our
25:02
civilization is the richest healthiest in many cases not always but pretty
25:08
healthy longest liveed civilization in all of human history and even if climate
25:13
change threatens that it still in no way creates conditions at all like the
25:19
conditions in which your grandparents and great-grandparents and infinitely far back great-grandparents had children
25:26
and made it possible for you to exist today so I think there's just a fundamental hopefulness that human
25:32
beings should carry with them in the act of forming families and be getting children that yes there will be
25:38
challenges it may not be climate change it might be you know just as no one anticipated the Corona virus it may be
25:44
some alien invasion it may be the alien thank you it may be the Alien Invasion
25:49
but you have to assume that it is it is good for human life to continue even in
25:56
the face of these challenges and that your kids will be no worse off in facing
26:02
these challenges than the generations upon generations of people who had kids and flourished and struggled and
26:09
suffered in much more difficult circumstances certainly than we in the United States are likely to face that
26:15
was beautiful Ross all right let's go on to Leslie who says please more book
26:22
recommendations oh God I love the readers I read the transit of Venus
26:28
after Lydia recommended it this summer what an Exquisite book I would also like to know more about Carlos reading out
26:34
loud to his kids in my experience as they age they sometimes become less Cooperative with reading aloud but he
26:41
seems to be reading with older kids High School aged I'll let I'll let you all deliver
26:47
the recommendations and I can no and then I can and then I can I can give the specific answer to the specific question
26:54
that was that was aimed at me I want to hear your book recommendations I do that all the time this is just for you Carlos care I when people say like what book
27:01
should I read what book do you like like I don't know I don't know you overthinking
27:06
it it always bothers me I'm reading a book I'm very enjoying it's called fire weather okay by John veent I'm not
27:13
trying to pronounce the last name v a i l l a n t oh yeah it was one of the New York Times top 10 books yes it was yes
27:19
it was um and it is about a extraordinary fire in Canada uh in
27:29
2016 what I what I'm enjoying so I'm about halfway through what I'm enjoying so far about this book is how the fire
27:36
itself is a vibrant and compelling character in the book um it it it com it
27:45
comes alive in in just a sort of extraordinary way um so fire weather
27:50
that's it I'm read that but now about about reading with my children um that is one of the great pleasures of
27:58
my life not just my my family life but my life period I hope it's a great pleasure for my for my wife and my
28:04
children as well um but the thing is I'm not that worried about the issue that
28:09
Leslie raises uh in terms of like you know Finding books that can appeal to different ages and that they kind of age
28:14
out of it um because think of the books that you've read and reread in your own
28:20
life you keep finding new things in them because you're a different reader you're a different person every time that you
28:27
read one of my favorite books growing up and still one of my favorite books is is Louise Fitz hu's Harriet the Spy when I
28:33
first read Harriet the Spy I was focused on Harriet at school and on her spy route you know because those were the
28:39
most kind of interesting and accessible and relevant parts of the book to me as I got older I was much more interested
28:45
in Harry's relationship with her parents which is a fascinating part of the story
28:50
so when I'm meeting with my kids who I have like one in high school one in middle school and one in elementary school um you know we end up reading
28:56
books that can appeal to each of them in a different way like you read Animal Farm it's different to a fourth grader
29:02
and to a ninth grader you know they can both get a lot out of it do you do funny accents when you read um I sometimes
29:09
change the voices a little bit and they they like that they think it's fun um
29:14
but I don't Focus so much on that okay okay because that's one of my special Pleasures as a reader all right let's
29:21
end on one of the shorter questions we received from listener Doug who asked
29:27
what would this show be like if you were all drinking wine thank you Doug I have asked that a
29:34
million times and nobody's listening to me who who's to say we're not you can't
29:39
see us yeah I'm I'm more of a martini person than a wine person but uh I think
29:45
that um Ross would probably um agree with me more If he if he was drinking no
29:52
the truth the truth is I am my that's such a sneaky way of saying that deep
29:57
down R actually subscri to your world view that's the invino verit view but
30:03
the other view is that yeah if you if you you know sort of altered my Consciousness in some sneaky way I would
30:09
have some bad opinions I would fall I would fall asleep that's the sad truth I would sing and nobody wants that oh I
30:16
would I I would sing be a lot of singing there'd be singing there'd be some Taylor Swift being being sung Carlos
30:23
does it have to be oh God don't be a baby we were both Young when I first saw
30:30
you all right let's leave it there singer privilege when we come back we'll
30:35
share what we would like to see stick around from this year into next hang in
30:41
[Music]
30:52
[Music] there
30:58
[Music]
31:10
[Music] and we're back so since this is our
31:18
final episode of the year I thought we would just end by talking about what we want to take with us from 2023 into 2024
31:27
thing or a feeling or an experience that will stick with you uh from the year
31:32
that was or the year that still is but is Vanishing as we speak um anyone well I um am moving as I've
31:41
mentioned a few times on this podcast my wife said to me the other night I feel like our whole personality is that we're moving because we just talk about it
31:47
constantly um but the thing that has actually been really wonderful in the move is uh the buy nothing group that I
31:54
belong to on Facebook um we are downsizing from a big apartment to a smaller one and so that's involved like
32:01
trying to get rid of a lot of stuff and it turns out it's really hard to give things away but like I love my buy
32:06
nothing group like I'll post something on there I'll be like hey I have this backpack it's a great backpack and the ability to like give it to a person who
32:12
will actually like use it and appreciate it and to have that kind of humant to human connection rather than just
32:18
stuffing in a bag and leaving it at the at the at the Goodwill Depot or something I don't know it's just been really great so I want to take that
32:25
energy of giving and sharing and perhaps consuming less uh with me into
32:31
2024 well I'll go next uh I took well I should say my wife and I took our family
32:37
of four children 12 and under to Europe this summer we went to London and
32:43
Amsterdam and Paris and Back to London and to Stonehenge and to various manners
32:48
and castles all the way up to Scotland um and you know it was a wonderful time
32:56
and honestly this is a very sort of dad thing to say but it was one of the
33:01
greatest logistical triumphs of my entire life and I I intend to carry I
33:08
intend to carry that satisfaction with me into whatever trips await in 2024
33:14
Michelle okay I'm going to get uncharacteristically mushy so um without
33:21
getting into too much detail this was a year when my household had multiple kind of heart stopping Health scares and
33:28
crises and multiple surgeries and at every step of the way no matter what I needed I discovered
33:35
that my friends were going to be there and they were going to step in whether it was food or sitting in a waiting room
33:41
or calling in the middle of the night or just letting me cry they were going to be there for me and at some point I even
33:49
told my husband you know you always have these fantasies about well we're going to retire and we're going to move to you know the south of France or this island
33:56
or you know you know the villages or whatever and I'm like honey I don't I don't think we can actually move away
34:02
from this group of people that we have come to depend on so much and love so much so it's completely cheesy to say
34:10
you can't live without somebody but my end of the year shout out for my friends
34:15
is we would not have made it through this year without you I love that wow it's beautiful Carlos tough act to
34:20
follow see us see us out into 2024 I I changed jobs about a year ago and
34:26
changing jobs is not always easy you know new colleagues new rhythms new
34:32
expectations self-imposed and um I discovered a couple of things one that the job of an opinion columnist as sexy
34:40
and exciting as it sounds high profile can be a little isolating it's kind of
34:45
you and your words and your thoughts but one thing that was new to me this year
34:52
as cheesy as this sounds was this podcast was matter of opinion and matter of opinion has given me a community that
35:00
I did not expect to get when I came to the times I did not think I'd be doing audio um and you know working every week
35:10
with the producers and the editors and the co-hosts has been a small unexpected
35:20
blessing for me um so I hope you're you're not crying I'm no I'm not crying
35:26
cry if if all of you and as as sort of as as um as unnatural as the audio um medium
35:34
feels like for me um it's been a a wonderful presence now I hope to carry
35:40
it forward in 2024 that kind of depends on on our listeners um
35:46
but happiness is in your hands yes so anyway thank you um to the listeners but
35:53
really to the team here that has given me this um this one wonderful new
35:58
community in my new professional home group hug for Carlos group hug for all of us group hug all right that concludes
36:05
