Carlos Sums Up the 2024 Election in Two Words


0:02
hey matter of opinion listeners it's
0:04
Carlos we're taking a break for the rest
0:06
of the year your favorite podcast host
0:09
will be back in January to share more of
0:11
our thoughts aloud in the meantime I'm
0:14
leaving you here with an audio essay
0:16
think of it as a stocking stuffer for
0:18
your feed that explores the two words
0:20
that Joe Biden and Donald Trump rely on
0:23
so much two words that I think reveal
0:25
the stakes in next year's presidential
0:28
election
0:38
so I read this book a few years ago
0:40
called the speech writer by Barton swam
0:42
who served as a speech writer for a
0:44
southern
0:45
governor and one of the points he made
0:48
is that politics is the art of
0:51
subtracting meaning from
0:53
language the politicians try to use as
0:55
many words as possible to say as little
0:57
as
0:58
possible and I think I think part of my
1:01
job as a journalist is to look through
1:05
those words and try to put the meaning
1:07
back so recently when I was reading
1:10
through a lot of President Biden's past
1:11
speeches I noticed a word he uses quite
1:14
a bit it's a very simple word and the
1:17
more I found it in his speeches and his
1:19
press conferences and his Zone writings
1:22
the more I realized it reflects his view
1:24
of America America still has the most
1:27
productive workers in the world America
1:28
still has a choice to make that sacred
1:31
flame still Burns America is still the
1:34
beacon to the world he doesn't just
1:37
believe in America he believes in
1:38
America
1:41
still it's never ever ever been a good
1:44
bet to bet against America and it still
1:49
isn't so Biden says stuff like we have
1:52
to show the world America is still a
1:55
beacon of light he wrote that in an
1:57
essay after the unite the right rally in
1:59
charlott film and just last fall in that
2:03
famous speech he gave at Independence
2:05
Hall in Philadelphia he said we are
2:07
still in America that believes in
2:08
honesty and
2:10
decency and respect for others
2:13
patriotism Liberty justice for all hope
2:15
possibilities we are still at our core a
2:20
democracy that still changes
2:24
everything because to say America is a
2:26
democracy is to make a statement of your
2:28
belief to say that we are still a
2:31
democracy is to make an argument that
2:34
still assumes that many Americans May no
2:36
longer believe in our profess virtues
2:38
and principles there's an insistence
2:41
almost a stubbornness to
2:43
still it's like Biden is trying to
2:45
persuade us of the value or the
2:48
endurance of American democracy it's
2:50
still here that still can be very
2:54
reassuring but it can also be kind of
2:56
alarming America is still the largest
2:59
economy in the world world we still have
3:01
the most productive workers and the most
3:03
Innovative Minds in the world but we've
3:06
risked losing our Edge as a
3:08
nation it admits fragility it admits
3:11
that something is at risk even while
3:13
it's arguing for it being permanent it's
3:17
the difference between seeing America as
3:19
somewhere between a reality and a
3:24
possibility the more I thought about
3:26
Biden still the more it made me think of
3:29
the again in Donald Trump's make America
3:32
great again
3:34
slogan the again is what makes or breaks
3:37
that slogan it hearkens back to some
3:39
kind of vague glorious time that was
3:42
taken away and we have to take back we
3:45
will make America powerful again wealthy
3:51
again strong again we will make the
3:55
pitch of make America great again is not
3:58
really about creating greatness it's
4:00
about restoring greatness safe
4:04
again and we will make America great
4:09
again thank you thank and the contrast
4:12
between Biden's still and Trump's again
4:15
says a lot to me about what a possible
4:18
rematch between these two guys in 2024
4:21
would be all about still is about
4:23
holding on to something good that might
4:25
be slipping away again is about bringing
4:27
back something better that was taken
4:31
way so they both look to the past but
4:34
they look to the Past in very different
4:35
ways the message of still is a message
4:38
of hope hope for what we might continue
4:40
being the message of again is a message
4:44
of nostalgia Nostalgia for what we once
4:47
were it's the difference between America
4:49
is an ideal worth preserving and a
4:52
memory worth
4:56
reliving I'm not a pollster right I
4:58
can't tell you which Mage will like play
5:00
best with you know swing voters or
5:01
whatever but I do feel that Nostalgia
5:04
can be more powerful than
5:07
hope hope is about the undefined
5:11
uncertain future Nostalgia is about
5:14
however you want to define the past so
5:17
if our presidential election is a Biden
5:19
V Trump rematch you can also think of it
5:22
as still versus again
5:28
