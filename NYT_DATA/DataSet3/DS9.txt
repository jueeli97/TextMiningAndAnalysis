hi there matter of opinion listeners
0:05
quite a Newsweek as you may have heard
0:07
yesterday Donald Trump was convicted on
0:09
34 felony counts in the hush money trial
0:11
in New York turns out my fellow co-hosts
0:14
aren't around right now to dig into that
0:15
with me Ross just had a baby Lydia's
0:18
covering the election in South Africa
0:20
and I think Michelle is reporting in a
0:21
saloon somewhere in Colorado we had an
0:24
episode already for you and you'll get
0:26
to hear it soon but given the breaking
0:28
news we're going to hand things over to
0:30
our colleagues in opinion they met right
0:33
after the verdict was announced to
0:34
discuss what comes next for Trump and
0:36
the presidential election your regular
0:38
matter of opinion crew will be back soon
0:40
I promise till then
0:43
[Music]
0:51
enjoy I'm Patrick Healey Deputy editor

of New York Times opinion I'm Michelle

Goldberg opinion columnist I'm David

French opinion columnist and recovering
1:01
[Music]
1:04
litigator Donald Trump has been found
1:06
guilty on all 34 felony counts of
1:09
falsifying business records in the hush
1:12
money case there's really no other word
1:15
but historic for this moment and we're
1:17
in uncharted waters in terms of the
1:20
political implications of Trump's
1:22
conviction and what it'll mean for the
1:24
presidential race for American unity and
1:27
for the
1:28
future guys we're recording this just 2
1:31
hours after the verdict was delivered in
1:33
one word how are you both feeling
1:36
Michelle thrilled David unsurprised oh
1:41
David you took my
1:43
word okay we're gonna have a arm Russell
1:46
unsurprised but Michelle you go first
1:49
why thrilled okay so it's not that I
1:51
think that this is going to finally put
1:53
an end to Donald Trump or even change
1:55
the trajectory of the election all that
1:57
much but I do think that if had been a
2:00
hung jury or an acquittal it would have
2:02
been really good for Trump and it would
2:04
have given him even more wind in his
2:05
back going into the election whereas
2:08
this is I think a reminder that Trump's
2:11
Aura of invincibility can be pierced
2:14
that you know he loses in court again
2:17
and again and again the fact that our
2:18
political system has proven so unequal
2:22
to restraining his rampant criminality
2:26
has I think given people a feeling of of
2:28
hopelessness and I hope that this
2:32
verdict punctures that a little bit
2:34
because you know when he's judged the
2:36
way other people are judged again and
2:39
again people juries judges see through
2:43
his misdoings it's so true the
2:45
institutions really have held up David
2:48
why surprised unsurprised unsurprised I
2:52
apologize unsurprised well that we're
2:54
really going to arm us that well I'm not
2:56
surprised because the strength of this
2:58
case was in the facts of the case and
3:00
that's what a jury decides a jury
3:02
decides the facts the the judge decides
3:04
the law the court of appeals decides if
3:06
the legal posture of the case was
3:08
correct but the jury addresses the facts
3:11
and the facts here are stronger than we
3:15
knew they were going into the trial
3:17
going into the trial I thought that the
3:19
evidence that Donald Trump falsified
3:21
business records and that he falsified
3:23
business records with a consciousness of
3:26
guilt
3:27
surrounding the entire hush money
3:30
process I thought the prosecution could
3:32
make that stick and then during the
3:34
trial itself the facts of the case were
3:37
stronger than I had believed before and
3:40
and one of the things that I thought was
3:41
particularly important in the case was
3:43
actually the Stormy Daniels testimony
3:45
because what the Stormy Daniels
3:46
testimony did is it showed clearly and
3:49
unequivocally why he would want to pay
3:51
hush money because she had a terrible
3:54
story to tell she had an awful story to
3:56
tell and at that time in the campaign
3:58
when she came forward right after the
4:00
axess Hollywood tape dropped and and
4:02
said I've got a story to tell it was
4:04
critical for him to suppress as much as
4:06
he could so the prosecution had a very
4:09
compelling story to tell which was he
4:11
was going to bury this and he was going
4:13
to spend a lot of money to bury it and
4:16
that he knew there was something about
4:18
it that was wrong that's why it was
4:20
concealed the that's why the payments
4:22
were mislabeled and so nothing about the
4:25
verdict actually surprises me to follow
4:28
on to what David said I mean was in the
4:30
courtroom for a couple of days including
4:32
for closing arguments and what struck me
4:34
is that the discourse around the case
4:37
has been sort of meta should Alvin brag
4:40
had brought it what will a conviction
4:41
mean to the election but in the
4:43
courtroom it was did Donald Trump do
4:46
these things that he's accused of and it
4:48
was so obvious that he did and even
4:51
though lawyers I spoke to thought that
4:54
Donald Trump's defense attorney did okay
4:56
with what he had from where I sit his
4:58
arguments just seem so ludicrous I guess
5:01
he can't argue in court right that
5:02
Donald Trump is being unfairly
5:04
persecuted for something that other
5:05
people get away with so instead he's
5:07
arguing that Donald Trump never had sex
5:10
with that woman right kind of echoing
5:12
Bill Clinton and then he is arguing that
5:15
the
5:17
$420,000 that Michael Cohen was paid to
5:20
reimburse him for paying off Stormy
5:22
Daniels was a legitimate legal fee based
5:26
on a handshake or verbal retainer
5:29
agreement that they had for Cohen to act
5:31
as his personal lawyer right it was just
5:34
it was Preposterous and then the other
5:36
thing that they argued which also I
5:38
thought was ridiculous was that David's
5:41
talking about how important the axis
5:43
Hollywood tape is and understanding the
5:45
kind of chronology and
5:46
motivations one of the things that
5:48
Donald Trump's defense attorney tried to
5:50
argue was that the Access Hollywood tape
5:52
actually didn't matter that much that it
5:53
was a bad day and there was going to be
5:55
you know a kind of a few days of
5:57
aggravation but that people were
5:59
exaggerating and thinking that this was
6:01
a major Moment In The Campaign which is
6:04
just if you lived through it that's
6:06
ridiculous yeah I think Michelle the
6:08
precise legal word for that argument is
6:11
Bonkers it's just wild we all remember
6:14
it this was the biggest story in America
6:17
and this was the first time that you
6:19
began to see Republicans fleeing the
6:21
campaign after the convention that after
6:24
after the Republicans Consolidated at
6:27
the convention you began to see cracks
6:29
in the facade after the Access Hollywood
6:31
tape that was a nine alarm fire that was
6:34
an emergency for the campaign and yet he
6:37
held it together and that goes to why I
6:39
felt surprised by this and it touches on
6:43
things that you two have both raised now
6:46
while our institutions have often held
6:49
up with well I think our legal
6:50
institutions our legal institutions have
6:53
held up that's the thing the ability of
6:56
Donald Trump and his team to have a
6:58
Playbook for almost any situation where
7:01
at the end of the day even if
7:03
reputations are scarred and people are
7:05
thrown under the bus he is still able to
7:08
evade accountability I only really saw
7:12
that in the 2020 election ultimately at
7:14
The Ballot Box and I've just found
7:16
myself thinking and and maybe it's a
7:17
little jaded but that of you get 12
7:20
jurors you know in a room hearing the
7:23
evidence that there may be just one or
7:25
two that sees a former president in the
7:29
dock
7:30
and wants such clear Smoking Gun level
7:34
Law and Order drama that just really
7:37
kind of L Nails him but they had it they
7:39
had they had smoking I mean they they
7:41
didn't they didn't literally have Donald
7:43
Trump saying a version of what he said
7:44
in Georgia which was you know find me
7:47
the you know ,000 votes that I need to
7:50
get no but they had tapes with him and
7:52
Michael Cohen's you know kind of talking
7:54
about the payment to stormmy Daniels I
7:56
think that you know I a lot of people
7:58
were worried and I was worried that
8:00
there was one juror that was sort of in
8:02
the tank for Trump um you know the Trump
8:04
campaign was floating this theory that
8:06
one Trump jur kind of kept making
8:08
meaningful eye contact with them that
8:10
they were lighting up when JD Vance came
8:12
into the room so I certainly worried
8:14
about that but in terms of the evidence
8:17
it was I mean it was just so incredibly
8:21
open and shut let me ask you that
8:23
Michelle who do you think was the key
8:26
witness in your opinion looking back on
8:28
it that got to conviction on all the on
8:30
all the charges oh God that's really
8:33
hard I mean I think that hope Hicks was
8:35
really important because she she
8:37
obviously wasn't trying to throw Donald
8:40
Trump under the bus and actually burst
8:42
into tears but also blew up the whole
8:46
story again that that the Access
8:48
Hollywood tape wasn't a big deal David
8:51
what about you you know I I think of a
8:53
number of people I think when early in
8:55
the trial when they set up the catch and
8:57
kill process yeah and sort of show how
8:59
all of that works I think that was very
9:01
important it it's a very simple and easy
9:04
to understand way of explaining how he
9:07
suppressed negative information and one
9:09
of the things you learn in a jury trial
9:11
is the side that can tell the most
9:14
compelling and easy to understand story
9:16
has an immense advantage and the
9:19
prosecution here had a real Advantage
9:21
because they had a very compelling story
9:23
which was to save his campaign he was
9:26
going to pay hush money and as part of
9:28
paying hush money he had to conceal it
9:30
you know the hush applied in all
9:32
directions he was concealing it from the
9:34
public he was even disguising the
9:35
payments internally all of this was
9:38
designed to save this campaign that was
9:40
in a point of Crisis and floundering
9:42
that's an elevator pitch that's a quick
9:44
statement of the case and then they
9:47
proceeded to in detail provide the
9:50
substantiation that's not to say that
9:52
the case was necessarily a complete slam
9:55
dunk there were factual elements that
9:58
the defense could have made more hay on
10:01
but I'm not necessarily convinced that
10:02
the defense was tainted in my view too
10:06
much by keeping one eye on the politics
10:08
of the case well the defense had to burn
10:10
a lot of their credibility I don't know
10:11
about a lot of their credibility but the
10:13
defense had to burn some of their
10:14
credibility in insisting that this
10:16
affair never happened right or actually
10:18
calling it an affair as an overstatement
10:19
but insisting that that the sex never
10:21
happened David I want to ask you you
10:24
know this is guilty on all 34 felony
10:28
counts not just a few but all 34 counts
10:32
how significant is that well I it's very
10:35
significant in two directions I mean
10:38
first this is about as thorough a
10:40
drubbing that you're going to see a
10:42
prosecution inflict on a defense at
10:44
trial uh a conviction on all counts is
10:47
quite significant independently the
10:50
other thing though that is very
10:51
significant is you have this conviction
10:52
on all counts against a backdrop where
10:55
Trump has been repeatedly held in
10:57
contempt during the course of this Tri
11:00
he demonstrates at least so far zero am
11:02
Morse at all and so when you're talking
11:04
about sentencing and what sentencing
11:06
will look like you'll have a verdict on
11:08
all counts a defendant who shows zero
11:11
remorse and a defendant who's been held
11:13
in contempt multiple times during the
11:15
criminal proceeding now in normal cases
11:18
that tends to mean that sentencing gets
11:20
more Draconian because judges are
11:24
looking for contrition they're looking
11:26
for cooperation they are looking for
11:28
some Reon to mitigate the sentence not
11:31
this guy not this guy David not this guy
11:34
in this case the most mitigating factor
11:37
is of course this is his first
11:39
conviction of a non-violent felony and
11:41
that's typically you don't typically get
11:43
jail time in that circumstance or you
11:45
don't typically get hit with the harder
11:48
Edge sentence in this case the firsttime
11:51
non-violent felony is balanced against
11:53
34 counts No Remorse multiple acts of
11:57
contempt and so it's going to it could
11:59
be very interesting to see how the judge
12:01
resolves this in sentencing in July yeah
12:03
let's just let's just clear that up
12:04
right now because you two are the best
12:06
in the business with predictions uh I
12:08
mean is Trump going to jail Michelle is
12:10
Trump is in terms of that sentencing and
12:12
it's a first conviction but there's no
12:14
Contrition is is he G to go to jail so
12:17
for I'm not going to Hazard a guess as
12:18
to whether or not he goes to jail for
12:20
this I think the question of whether or
12:22
not Donald Trump ultimately Goes to Jail
12:24
is you know one of the central issues in
12:27
this election if he loses I think he
12:28
goes to jail on something right this was
12:30
just this was the least serious of the
12:33
felony trials that await him and some of
12:37
those have been you know kind of
12:38
postponed through the minations of his
12:42
various Lackey um you know on the
12:44
Supreme Court and on other courts but
12:46
they're going to happen eventually and I
12:48
think that you know this again is a shot
12:50
in the arm it's a reminder to people
12:52
that this can happen but if Donald Trump
12:55
is elected you know presumably he even
12:58
if gets sentenced to jail in July at
13:01
sentencing he appeals right and
13:03
presumably he's on bail pending appeal
13:06
and this stretches past the election and
13:09
then you kind of have this question of
13:13
Donald Trump in office with the jail
13:16
sentence on the other side and already a
13:19
disinclination to leave you know I just
13:22
think that that sort of he's already
13:24
started talking you know kind of kidding
13:26
not kidding about serving three terms
13:29
but for those of us who are worried that
13:30
if Donald Trump becomes president again
13:32
he is not going to leave the White House
13:36
voluntarily while he's still alive I
13:38
think that the prospect of jail sentence
13:40
on the other end kind of heightens that
13:42
concern Michelle you have my head
13:44
spinning in these scenarios but I think
13:46
you're absolutely right about all of
13:47
them
13:49
[Music]
14:10
David the jury came back in just two
14:14
days a very mean relatively quick return
14:18
and as I said you know guilty on all
14:20
counts and I'm thinking about Michelle's
14:22
point just about jail time sooner rather
14:25
than later I am wondering if this judge
14:28
in sentence
14:29
in July looks at that quick verdict that
14:34
absolute it seems like you know
14:37
certainty verdict and does come back
14:39
with some some jail time what do you
14:41
think and does the timing affect it at
14:43
all or is that just apples nous even
14:46
though Trump has not been remorseful
14:49
even though Trump was cited multiple
14:51
times for contempt I'm still of the view
14:54
that it's a stretch that he'll serve
14:56
time in prison because of that first
14:58
time nonviolent felony status I'm much
15:02
less confident of that than I was three
15:04
weeks ago four weeks ago three or four
15:06
weeks ago I would have said No Patrick
15:08
he's no way he's going to spend time in
15:11
in jail now I'm not as sure I would
15:13
still be surprised but what I would also
15:16
say is uh Michelle had on something very
15:18
important there's an appeal coming here
15:21
and so that this case is not over there
15:24
is going to be an appeal and the appeal
15:26
will be fought on the grounds where the
15:29
prosecution is weakest and the
15:31
prosecution is weakest when it comes to
15:33
the underlying legal Theory Michelle you
15:36
attended the trial and you wrote about
15:38
how a lot of Americans were really kind
15:40
of tuning out the proceedings um I'm
15:43
very interested in the impact that this
15:45
verdict is going to have particularly on
15:48
swing voters just in the weeks and
15:50
months to come as we sit here now it's a
15:53
historic result but what kinds of impact
15:57
do you think the verdict might have on
16:02
certain voters on the election so look
16:04
obviously I don't I think most voters
16:06
are locked in and I don't believe those
16:08
surveys in which 15 177% of Voters say
16:13
that a conviction will change their
16:15
minds I think most of them will be able
16:17
to rationalize voting for a
16:19
felon but you know the the last our
16:22
elections tend to be extremely close and
16:24
so we're not talking about that many you
16:26
know it doesn't have to change that many
16:28
people's minds for it to have a big
16:30
impact um I think a lot of people for
16:32
example in 2016 think that Comey
16:35
reopening the case against Hillary
16:38
Clinton was something that was decisive
16:40
in in that election even though you know
16:43
you kind of think about who are the
16:44
people who were going to vote for
16:45
Hillary Clinton and then that changed
16:47
their mind in as much as there's a sort
16:49
of Tipping Point of Scandal and in as
16:51
much as people think well this is just
16:53
going to be too chaotic to have a
16:55
president who might be in jail or who
16:58
who's running to keep himself out of
17:00
jail you know again it doesn't have to
17:02
change that many Minds for it to be
17:04
really important and then the other
17:05
thing I'd say is that part of the impact
17:08
could be precisely because people
17:10
haven't been paying a lot of attention
17:11
so the New York Times Sienna poll of
17:14
Swing voters showed that most of them
17:18
did not expect him to be convicted you
17:20
know large numbers of Republicans but
17:22
also Independents and even pretty
17:24
significant numbers of Democrats and so
17:27
the fact that he was convicted is going
17:30
to be jarring for some people and again
17:34
may cause at least a few of them to
17:35
rethink some of their priors it's such
17:38
an important Point Michelle I mean
17:40
throughout the primaries last year and
17:42
into this year so many people thought
17:44
that he wouldn't get convicted you there
17:46
were Republicans in our New York Times
17:48
focus groups who didn't think Donald
17:50
Trump would be the nominee that there
17:51
were too many obstacles to him there is
17:53
such a power that comes from the simple
17:56
fact that he has now been convicted and
17:58
and I'm not sure how that gets messaged
18:01
by the other side but with 5 months to
18:03
go I think that there will be voters in
18:07
those suburbs of Philadelphia or in some
18:11
of the Northern parts of Wisconsin that
18:13
can be on the swing your side and that
18:16
care to some degree about ethics and
18:19
government and and let's remember he's
18:21
going to be sentenced like three or four
18:23
days before the Republican convention
18:25
you know so this is going to stay top of
18:27
Mind totally you know the other thing
18:29
about this that I think is very
18:31
interesting is the people who are the
18:33
repeat voters like the 2020 voters the
18:36
people who are most engaged they're
18:38
Biden it's the people who are disengaged
18:42
that are supporting Trump the people who
18:43
are the lower propensity voters the less
18:45
engaged people tend to support Trump
18:47
that's a huge challenge for the Biden
18:49
campaign because you can sit there and
18:51
say to them well you need to change your
18:52
messaging or you need to change your
18:54
strategy in some way but if the voters
18:56
are disengaged they won't know anything
18:58
about the messaging change but you know
19:00
what does break through Trump convicted
19:04
those two words Trump convicted that's
19:07
something that breaks through even if
19:08
you're only getting your news
19:09
occasionally on Tik Tok or on Facebook
19:13
and I think that this has a real
19:14
potential to break through with the very
19:17
disengaged voters that are Biden's
19:20
weakness right now and yes some of them
19:23
will reflectively sort of have that
19:25
distrust of Institutions and say this
19:27
was political but others are going to be
19:31
surprised to hear that Donald Trump was
19:32
convicted of a felony and that will
19:35
shake some people and I'm not naive I
19:39
know that some hope that the dam will
19:42
break and all the Trump support will be
19:43
washed away that's that's 2016 thinking
19:47
that's not 2024 thinking but what is
19:50
possible is more erosion more chipping
19:53
away at that Trump support and the more
19:57
the disengaged voters are exposed to
20:00
those two words Trump convicted the more
20:03
that might make a difference but I have
20:05
to raise the the issue of the appeal
20:08
again here's something I'm worried about
20:10
I'm worried about an situation where
20:13
Trump is convicted he loses a close
20:16
election and then the case is tossed on
20:18
appeal which is quite possible and I
20:21
think that that could be a very negative
20:24
development yeah if that happens and I'm
20:26
very and I'm actually quite worried
20:28
about
20:29
I think you're talking about a
20:30
short-term point and a long-term Point
20:32
David that are really important
20:34
shortterm language that can break
20:36
through was so important in 2016 we had
20:39
build a wall Mexico will pay for it lock
20:42
her up there were just certain phrases
20:44
as outrageous as they were that stayed
20:47
with people in 2020 there was a certain
20:49
degree of like normaly or let's just get
20:51
back to normal that was sort of a you
20:53
know a soft pitch but it worked for a
20:55
lot of people it spoke to where they
20:56
were Trump convicted may not not be a
20:59
hopeful or aspirational message but it
21:01
is something that Brands the opponent
21:04
better than trying to convince people
21:06
that the economy wasn't as great under
21:09
Donald Trump as it was under Joe Biden
21:11
the the risk of
21:13
explaining politics too much doesn't
21:17
redound in the same way as one kind of
21:19
like strong message like Trump convicted
21:21
now longer term I mentioned at the top
21:24
about American Unity I am very curious
21:26
about how all this washes out I think
21:28
Michelle is right that those other cases
21:31
are more likely to lead to jail time but
21:34
when history gets written and the Maga
21:36
base still exists you know 4 eight years
21:39
from now if Donald Trump looks like he's
21:42
someone who was kind of put through the
21:44
legal ringer and there was what seems to
21:48
people like unfairness Witch Hunt rigged
21:52
system if there are questions about
21:54
appeal if it turns out messier than one
21:57
might hope that could have its own
21:59
damaging effects wait can I just push
22:01
back on that a little bit because I just
22:02
feel like we never talk about the sense
22:06
of Injustice experienced by people
22:08
who've had to watch Donald Trump enjoy
22:12
impunity over and over again you know
22:14
there's a a lot of people who have lost
22:16
faith in and I include myself among them
22:19
who have who started out cynical about
22:22
the Supreme Court and who now see it as
22:26
a wholly corrupt Institution you know I
22:29
feel like there's there's always a lot
22:30
of worry about the Maga base and their
22:33
view of the legitimacy of Institutions
22:36
and again I just think that the Maga
22:38
base is going to feel victimized almost
22:41
no matter what happens right they they
22:43
won an election in 2016 despite losing
22:46
the popular vote really decisively and
22:49
then spent you know four years feeling
22:52
like they had somehow been mistreated
22:56
and so you know that's happening no what
22:59
I I do think that one thing that could
23:01
potentially and again this might be
23:03
wishful thinking but I also think Donald
23:06
Trump loses this election I mean again
23:09
maybe this is just like kind of hopium
23:11
but I don't think if he loses he's going
23:13
to be the candidate in
23:14
2028 and so if the Republicans lose
23:18
another election against an extremely
23:21
unpopular incumbent you have to think
23:24
that there's going to be some sort of
23:27
Reckoning and some sort of you know just
23:30
as I'm old enough to remember when
23:32
people treated George W bush as this
23:35
kind of Godly you know figure this
23:38
Paragon of Manliness you know there was
23:40
these caricatures with this bulging Cod
23:42
piece it was disgusting and you know and
23:45
and then he he became a a loser and and
23:48
something that that people were ashamed
23:49
of and didn't want to be associated with
23:51
and I think it's you know that could
23:54
that could happen here if he doesn't
23:55
lead them to the promised land yeah I
23:58
think you're right I mean the dam isn't
24:01
going to break just because of trump
24:03
convicted I think it can get through to
24:05
a lot of people but the the fever on the
24:07
right is certainly not going to break
24:09
but I think what it will take is that
24:12
loss that loss in November you know yet
24:15
another setback a party that at least
24:18
part of it has to ask themselves is this
24:20
the best that we can do let me ask you
24:23
both I feel like the big idea that I'm
24:26
hearing from the two of you is that this
24:29
is a historic conviction no doubt that
24:33
institutions held once again and did
24:36
their job in terms of holding Donald
24:38
Trump to account and yet the Trump story
24:42
is not over and that for a result that
24:47
has a stamp of finality on Trump's
24:51
influence Over America at the end of the
24:54
day it really is going to happen at The
24:57
Ballot Box it's not going to happen
24:59
through all these trials as important as
25:01
they are as legitimate as the charges
25:03
are that Trump's influence in staying
25:06
power in American politics ultimately
25:08
really comes down to The Ballot Box Fair
25:11
unfair how do you see it I mean I think
25:13
that's right and I think that that's why
25:15
people a lot of people tuned out this
25:16
trial because they sort of knew that you
25:20
know whatever the verdict the real
25:22
verdict is in November David what do you
25:24
think so I I think that the ballot boxes
25:28
really going to tell Trump's fate but I
25:31
I will say this I would say that when
25:33
you're talking about a person who is a
25:36
convicted or he's been found liable for
25:38
sex abuse he's now been convicted of a
25:41
felony and then if he wins the election
25:44
and also don't forget the you know kind
25:46
of massive fraud he was involved with
25:47
his company yeah defamation also of the
25:50
person he abused I mean there there's so
25:52
much here he's he's been found liable
25:55
for fraud he's been found liable for sex
25:56
abuse he's been found liable for
25:58
defamation now he's been convicted as a
26:00
felon if he wins
26:03
anyway the religious Zeal around Donald
26:07
Trump will be something to see if we
26:11
think that there has been a trump cult
26:12
already if he wins in spite of all of
26:15
this the Trump cult will be uh we will
26:21
have seen nothing yet is what I would
26:23
say and and the level at which he would
26:25
feel empowered to execute his
26:29
objectives of Vengeance I would get
26:32
truly scary truly scary so in my view in
26:36
an interesting way this verdict only
26:40
increased the stakes of the election and
26:43
the thing that worries me about that is
26:45
go to Circle back to the very thing that
26:46
we talked about a few minutes ago which
26:48
is right now it looks like the the
26:51
election is going to stand or fall based
26:52
on the least engaged people in the
26:54
United States and that is an environment
26:57
where
26:58
you know if I'm a political consultant
27:01
that is a frustrating reality because
27:05
Donald Trump could win in large part
27:07
because people who don't follow any of
27:10
this and don't pay close attention to
27:12
any of this put him over the top and and
27:16
then if that occurs the religious Zeal
27:19
of his base as I said will be something
27:22
to see and the Vengeance will get very
27:25
dangerous very quickly
27:29
David Michelle it's so great to talk to
27:31
you both thanks for Gathering so quickly
27:33
oh thanks so much thanks so much really
27:35
enjoyed the conversation
27:37
