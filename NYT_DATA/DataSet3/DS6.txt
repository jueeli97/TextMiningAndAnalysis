The ‘Disdain’ of Justice Alito and the Supreme Court


0:00
so this is really coming out on Flag Day that is hilarious
0:07
flags from New York Times opinion I'm Carlos loada I'm Michelle coddle and I'm Lydia P Green and this is matter of
0:14
opinion where thoughts are always
0:20
[Music]
0:28
allowed all right we're back actually Ross isn't back until next week but Michelle and Lydia and I are reunited
0:35
and it feels so good and we've got a special guest today for a conversation about the Supreme Court Jesse Wegman is
0:42
a member of the New York Times editorial board and writes frequently about the high court uh any action on that beat
0:47
lately Jesse none none yeah it's been a quiet eight years I've had nothing to do
0:53
so quiet between the court and Trump it's like uh I haven't seen my family since 2015 they send their regards they
0:59
miss you the New York Times is grateful for your service yeah um well we are glad you are
1:04
with us even if your family misses you because the court has lots of big decisions still coming this term on
1:10
abortion rights on presidential Immunity on the regulatory power of the executive branch to name just a few and I should
1:17
say we're having this conversation before the court issues this week's opinions and the reason we're doing that
1:23
is because there's been a lot of focus on the behavior and conduct and statements of the justices themselves in
1:29
particular a associate Justice Samuel Alo not to recap all of it but first
1:34
there was that Revelation in the times that in early 2021 alito's home in Northern Virginia flew an upside down
1:40
American flag a symbol that has been associated with u stop the steel efforts
1:45
that was just Apparently one of two controversial Flags uh on Alo properties and then just this week we learned that
1:50
Alo had been secretly recorded discussing American politics and political polarization and saying among
1:56
other things that it's the media's fault that the public trust in the court is so low now Justice Leo is absolutely
2:03
right that trust in the court has fallen in recent Years and we're going to explore why that is in our conversation
2:08
and what happens to an institution like the Supreme Court when the public trust that it commands weakens so does that
2:14
sound like a plan let's do it so good all right beautiful uh first off though let's start off with that sort of weird
2:21
recorded conversation Michelle can you tell us what that was all about oh you know I'd be delighted so earlier this
2:28
month a woman who self-identified as an advocacy journalist posed as a conservative Catholic in order to
2:34
secretly record conversations with some of the justices at this private Supreme Court Gala so at the event she pushed
2:42
Samuel Alo and John Roberts on the idea that the scotus should be working to put
2:47
the United States on a more Godly moral path oo totally agreed with her Roberts
2:53
pushed back to his credit and the episode has thrown gas on the already
2:59
Brewing controversy over some of the justices and especially alit's ability to serve as objective umpires in hot
3:07
budon cases so that is kind of where we are with another burst of outrage over
3:14
personal questions about the Justice's Behavior or statements so what struck you guys most from what Alo said in
3:21
these um in these unguarded moments well you know the bar is remarkably low here to say the right
3:27
thing you know I think if you're a Supreme Court Justice it's probably wise to assume that somebody uh somewhere is
3:33
recording every single word you say and John Roberts the Chief Justice said what
3:38
a Supreme Court Justice should say which is that's not our job it's not our job to put the nation on a moral path our
3:45
job is to decide the cases before us and he also pushed back on the notion that America's a Christian Nation this is a
3:50
low bar like it's not hard to say those things because that's the job of a
3:55
Justice is to show that you are approaching the job with as much fairness as is humanly possible Samuel
4:01
Leo either isn't capable of or doesn't care to do that uh he and Justice Thomas
4:07
in particular seem just to essentially be you know flipping the bird to the country and saying we have no obligation
4:14
to you even though we're unelected even though we serve for life we are unanswerable to you yeah I mean that's
4:19
what struck me about him with alito's response I question the appropriateness
4:26
of secretly recording people in private or kind of what they understand to be private
4:31
settings but that said it kind of just fuels the whole sense that he just has
4:37
complete disdain for the Public's concerns about the court especially when
4:43
public trust in the court is in the absolute toilet so whatever he really
4:49
thinks or whether he was just being agreeable or whatever it it just kind of feeds the bigger picture of him as
4:54
somebody who cannot be bothered well Alo is notorious for his agreeability right everyone knows that he's just the his
5:02
brand right it's the same thing with the flag right I mean he has all these kind of uh flimsy excuses about his wife
5:09
putting the flag up and he didn't see it and he didn't know what it meant and I don't really necessarily believe any of
5:14
those but even let's credit him with all of those and say even still you've been a Justice of the Supreme Court going on
5:21
two decades now you know that is hugely inappropriate to do something like that I mean people in Far lower positions of
5:27
government would be fired over things like that so just the absolute disregard for the most basic obligations of one of
5:35
the top jurists in the world is what's so shocking here and so upsetting and so damaging to the legitimacy of the Court
5:41
okay can I can I disent here I I I just you're honor I I listened
5:48
to the recordings and then I read the
5:53
transcript of the recordings multiple times just to see if I was getting something wrong because I did not have a
5:59
major freakout um or even a minor freak out over the the content of these
6:04
recordings it does not surprise me or bother me to learned that Samuel Leo believes the decline of religious
6:10
observance in America is not a good thing the godliness thing by the way that's the term that like everyone has
6:15
seized on it is not a term he used he expressed agreement with the idea he he
6:21
didn't what he thought was a one-on-one conversation with someone he'd met before at this nonprofit fundraising
6:26
dinner I'm frankly more upset with the fact that annual dues in 500 bucks can buy you that kind of direct access to to
6:32
the justices his views on polarization were to my mind fairly mainstream and probably correct like he said there can
6:39
be ways of working of living peacefully together but it's difficult then he explains why it's difficult because the
6:46
differences on fundamental things really can't be compromised that to my mind is an entirely accurate description of how
6:53
polarization and culture wars are playing out in America the the last thing I'll say is that I think the
6:59
comparison with Roberts is slippery and is unfair the comments by the two
7:05
justices are in response to two very different questions when Lauren Windor is talking to Alo she's saying broadly
7:11
that people of Faith should try to win moral arguments in America that's what Alo is agreeing to when she's talking to
7:17
Roberts she asks him far more specifically should the court use its power to guide us down this moral path
7:24
that's what he disagrees with these are two different questions and that's why I'm not surprised they elicit different
7:29
answers yes but I also think like and this is I think in some ways bolsters your point there are things that Alo has
7:35
said quite intentionally in speeches that you can watch on YouTube that make very clear his beliefs about the role of
7:41
religion in public life and what religious liberty actually is which is I would say a very unorthodox American
7:47
interpretation of what religious liberty is um so I I would tend to agree with you that like you know these remarks in
7:53
and of themselves might not seem that sort of shocking but when you take them as as a
8:00
constellation of of his prior um but sorry Jesse about to jump I actually was
8:05
going to say what Lydia just said which is this is part of a much larger pattern that we have become very familiar with
8:11
in Sam Alo let's not forget he's the author of the case that struck down roie Wade and while he couldn't you know
8:18
directly say in that case well it's this is It's religiously based uh justice Alo
8:24
is on that side and so it's really hard to I think hear these kinds of comments which I will agree with of you are not
8:30
on their own the most egregious things I've ever heard a Justice say but it's hard to hear them and not tie them into
8:37
all of these other examples of his attitude about religion not just in public life but in government right uh
8:44
in terms of how the government treats religion how the government treats religious claims as compared with other
8:49
claims and so I think you can't hear all of that without the Echoes filtering
8:55
through so how much of an outlier on the court do you feel AO is Michelle talked about his complete
9:02
disdain for the Public's concerns about the court how do the other justices sort of deal with that kind of question I
9:09
think that Alo and Justice Clarence Thomas are in a category of their own just in terms of you know really really
9:17
being incredibly dismissive of questions of accountability for their you know
9:22
speech Behavior things like that um because I think Thomas is you know there's just been like a a string of
9:28
reporting both about the activ theal acties of his of his wife but also
9:33
his very very very expensive luxury travel sponsored by you know people who
9:39
arguably have business before the court and you know there is an unseemliness to that and I think that the total disdain
9:46
and disregard for any kind of scrutiny of that behavior is to me you know pretty shocking yeah this is a question
9:52
of being on a spectrum all the justices at some point have done things that had to be reported or that you could
9:58
arguably complain about they've taken a trip they've taken tickets but you know the question is is this just a huge
10:05
pattern can I I want to add on here you know Lydia used the term unseemly it's
10:10
certainly that but I would go a good deal further this is illegal Behavior right this is against the law federal
10:16
recusal law for example is very clear it says any justice judge or magistrate judge of the United States note the word
10:22
justice in there shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his
10:28
impartiality might reason ably be questioned now obviously that's some broad language but I think we have
10:34
plenty of examples in recent years particularly of justices refusing to
10:39
recuse themselves even in pretty extreme circumstances like the ones we've seen with Justice justices Thomas and Alo and
10:46
these justices seem to act with largely with impunity okay Jesse can you just back us up for a minute and go over the
10:54
kind of recent Brewing controversy over the January 6 themed case
11:00
and the refusal of recusal with these guys well so that might be the most
11:06
egregious example of all right we have several cases relating to the events on
11:11
and around January 6 2021 um the the highest profile one is the one in which
11:16
Donald Trump is being prosecuted for his role in the Insurrection and uh has claimed complete immunity from
11:23
prosecution because he was president at the time I won't get into the you know weeds of the argument but it's an absurd
11:31
completely ahistorical completely illogical argument and the Supreme Court is taking its sweet time deciding it
11:36
essentially making it impossible to have a trial in that case before the election
11:41
but in all of these cases all nine justices are sitting and the argument you could make is that at the very least
11:48
Justice Clarence Thomas should be recusing himself from anything related to January 6 because of the behavior of
11:53
his wife Jenny Thomas is a well-known hardcore right-wing activist who has
11:58
been you know in the middle of so many issues that have come before the court for the last several decades and on
12:05
January 6 she was literally at the ellipse listening to Donald Trump give his speech uh you know sort of riling up
12:11
the crowd which then later stormed the capital now she says she left before the
12:16
the the crowd went to the capital fine I believe that but but the bottom line is she is way too close to this case and
12:23
she is way too close to him by his and her own admission they are an extraordinarily close couple to make
12:29
anybody I think feel reasonably comfortable that Justice Thomas is approaching these cases with anything
12:35
like an open mind and so I think that might be the most extreme example of uh
12:41
sort of where a Justice should be recusing under the standards of federal law and is not how about Justice Alo
12:47
like after the the flag stories were reported in the New York Times Democratic lawmakers called on Leo to rec accuse himself from from these cases
12:54
involving the the Trump immunity case and sort of cases involving January 6 Alita wrote a letter explaining why he
13:00
was declining to do so he said I am confident that a reasonable person who is not motivated by political or
13:05
ideological considerations or desired to affect the outcome of Supreme Court cases would conclude that the events
13:11
recounted above do not meet the applicable standard for recusal I'm therefore required to reject your
13:16
request required no less it's not it's not him it's not him it's just But but so should should he you know should Alo
13:23
you you've laid out the case for for Thomas do you all think Alo as well should recuse himself from these cases
13:29
and why I I mean I'll here let me say this this this gets to the the ethics code
13:36
sorry I'm going to give a little background here the Supreme Court is not bound by any code of ethics the lower
13:41
federal courts have been bound for about 50 years by a very clear code of ethics which probably would have required the
13:46
recusal of both justices Thomas and delo in these cases but the Supreme Court has never been bound in this way it drafted
13:53
its own code of ethics last fall and I and many other uh observers of the Court
13:59
pointed out very quickly because it was very obvious that this code falls short in a number of ways and you can hear the
14:05
Echoes of the way it falls short in Justice alto's letter there so just to use one example what does he say there
14:11
at the beginning Carlos he says something like I am confident that a reasonable person who is not motivated
14:16
by what political right that's the standard in the code of conduct that's the this new code of conduct for better
14:23
for worse has that standard that J should disqualify himself when a reasonable person aware of all the
14:28
circumstances where the hell excuse me but where the hell did the court come up with that standard right I mean that stand all
14:35
right let's let's talk about that for a minute okay the reasonable person standard that's a real thing that the law relies on a lot it's a kind of
14:42
Common Sense approach to gray areas in human conduct all right but the Court's
14:48
code of conduct says reasonable unbiased person and I was like wait where did
14:53
unbiased come from that's not that's not a standard in the law and what does unbiased even mean and what does Justice
14:59
Alo even mean when he says who is not motivated like what is he talking about
15:04
like why is the person's political motivation or or personal politics even
15:09
relevant here right this is I mean yes a single C could ask for the recusal of
15:14
any justice and we're not going to just accept that that will kind of that any one person could could change the makeup
15:20
of the court for a given case to to affect the outcome but come on I mean this is like millions of people around
15:27
the country are pointing out that the Justice himself has implicated himself in his behavior and in his wife's
15:33
behavior and I think I just I am I'm shocked at the weakness of his Arguments
15:38
for why he shouldn't recuse yeah I think that this gets to sort of the the bigger question of kind of bias and
15:45
politicization and you know this idea of the legal priesthood and and how the court has talked about itself right I
15:51
mean Amy Coney Barrett who was speaking at an Institute named for Mitch McConnell one of the most skillful
15:56
politicizes of the uh of the Court in American history she declared that this
16:02
court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks judicial philosophies are not the same as political parties I mean
16:08
that sounds great uh you know even if you ignore the venue but people are going to look at the actual outcome of
16:14
these decisions and see that there is really no ideological deviation or very very very little ideological deviation
16:22
which does I think make people you know ask the question are these just a bunch of partisan acts I'm going to take a slightly different position I draw a
16:30
distinction between following a process and reaching a certain outcome that is
16:35
in keeping with the job in general versus say being Clarence Thomas and going and speaking at a right-wing Fest
16:44
or ideology versus partisanship right right those are two different things
16:50
that's what you're is that the distinction you're drawing judicial ideology versus like naked partisanship
16:56
that you are doing publicly in many cases which just thumbs your nose at the
17:02
American people and we're talking about more than half the country now think
17:08
that the court is if not broken then kind of irretrievably bent and so I
17:14
think that that is its own sin well and I think I think that's why the recusal question to me like doesn't actually
17:20
matter all that much a he's not going to do it and B um you know he's not going to do it and so and like that that
17:26
points to like the sort of the deeper underlying problem here right is that this is a court that feels completely
17:32
untethered from accountability in any sort of big reasonable sense and look
17:38
our constitution was designed that way right I mean we these are lifetime appointments these are not elected judges you know we can talk about you
17:43
know the role of politics and judges and the history and all that kind of stuff but what's absolutely clear to me is
17:49
that the Democratic sort of legitimacy of the Court was always tenuous by
17:54
Design but it feels that there's just been a fundamental uncoupling um in a way that feels quite
17:59
dangerous yes the court by Design is a fragile institution it exists um both
18:06
within and without American politics and that is why the justices need to be so
18:12
scrupulous about their behavior about their comments uh about how they write their opinions because they are holding
18:17
a very delicate trust in their hands and they need to honor the previous courts they need to think about future courts
18:25
and courts have been made up of people who are chosen for IAL reasons all the time I don't want to pretend that this
18:30
is somehow new but there is something new in the partisan hardheadedness of this you know I think what we haven't
18:36
mentioned yet is that the makeup of this current Court was created entirely out of the most intense partisan hard ball
18:43
any of us has ever seen in our lifetimes which is Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans literally blocking Barack
18:50
Obama from filling a seat on the court after Justice Scalia died in 2016 and
18:56
then doing the exact reverse in 2020 uh by forcing through you know Amy Cony
19:01
Barrett at the last minute after people had already started voting in the 2020 election there's no principle to it it's
19:06
simply about power and it's about partisan political power and that is what changed for me and for a lot of
19:13
people I think changed the way we think about the court and what the court does and how the court behaves and what its role is in American society so
19:20
everything that I think about this court is through that
19:25
lens let's take a break and when we come come back we'll talk more about what can be done if anything to restore trust in
19:32
the Supreme Court
19:38
[Music]
19:56
[Music] I want to follow up on something that both Lydia and Jesse talked about and
20:03
that is we talk about sort of trust and legitimacy as if they were almost sort
20:08
of like interchangeable Concepts but they're not really necessarily the same thing and you know how do they affect
20:14
one another how is it that why is trust so important to the legitimacy of the
20:20
court so here's how I would put it you know as Alexander Hamilton pointed out more than 200 years ago the court has
20:27
neither money nor guns right it's not like the Congress or or the executive branch they rely on the American people
20:36
believing in them and accepting their rulings in order for them to have the power that they do that is their
20:43
legitimacy and that legitimacy deres from the trust of the people if the people don't trust in the court there is
20:50
going to be increasing push back to the rulings of the court because they say this is not a valid ruling or this is a
20:56
politicized ruling whatever it might be and the court gets a lot of breathing room in American society the court has
21:03
issued a lot of rulings that people abide by even though they make a lot of people very mad but I think this current
21:08
court is really testing those Outer Limits and I I fear for what we're going to see in the coming years if it
21:14
continues on the aggressive path that it's taking so does anyone see a way forward for restoring some of this trust
21:20
or is that just you know wishful thinking part of it part of it depends on how we pinpoint the problem right and
21:28
is an issue with sort of the practice of democracy RIT large do you think of it as a process or do you think of it as an
21:34
outcome is the problem with with declining trust in the court you know if
21:39
if if they only got their code of ethics right you know if um you know like is it
21:44
is it procedural right or is it like you see certain outcomes yeah and then you
21:50
decide oh this is a court that is too politicized and I don't I don't trust it is is trust a problem of process or a
21:56
problem of outcome well I mean it or is it also just a problem of perception right one one comparison that I I would
22:03
make is obviously a much less powerful position but one where the appearance of impartiality or of being partisan is
22:10
really fatal is you know the leader of a major news organization right you don't give money to political parties you just
22:16
sort of instinctively know that not just your personal conduct but the conduct of your family members is going to be
22:22
scrutinized and that it's absolutely crucial to establishing the the belief that you are approaching to and leading
22:29
your organization with an open mind and so I could just never imagine you know an editor of a major Newsroom uh having
22:35
a stop to steal flag flying and then blaming their wife like is just not a thing that that would happen but I will
22:40
also note with uh some ruthful that our profession journalism is one of the least trusted so you know we have these
22:48
like very strict ethical codes that we abide by uh I think to great a fact but
22:54
that clearly has not solved the trust problem right and and I think that that should chasen Us in thinking that the
23:01
adoption to to Great Fanfare of certain standards of behavior are in and of themselves going to transform the
23:08
landscape of trust and I think you know there are many many reasons why people don't trust journalism that don't trust
23:13
journalists but I I don't think it's because of the ethical codes that we hold ourselves to it's also the other
23:21
branches of government have far more power uh than they currently wield so Congress in particular has become a
23:27
largely dysfunctional and factless Branch but it could do a lot more to pass laws and then to
23:34
respond to Supreme Court uh rulings than it is currently doing so we don't need to treat the court as the be all andall
23:41
of American constitutional interpretation it is an important voice in that National debate it is not the
23:48
last word but but the other thing that I'll say and this gets to this question of of legitimacy and representation and
23:53
and I think underscores your point about Congress look I'm in my late 40s right so my entire adult lifetime has been
24:01
spent in a time where Republicans have been unable to to capture the presidency via the popular vote except for once uh
24:08
in the aftermath of 911 so it does feel strange that we live in a country where
24:15
a a incredibly important branch of government which is proposed by the president and then confirmed by the
24:21
Senate you know is essentially dominated by Republicans to me that sort of speaks
24:27
to this kind of broader issue um you know it's issues of American democracy and representation and things like that
24:32
but I I I just think that like it it feels weird in a democracy to have a
24:37
court that's so untethered from where the national popular vote is okay so if
24:43
we take political feasibility out of it would there be systemic solutions that you think would
24:49
address that you know like say term limits or stagger terms or I'm not a
24:54
huge pack the court fan or expand the court fan but what about some other
25:00
stuff or if you are a pack the court fan let me know I mean I think I'd be open to almost anything at this stage because
25:07
I don't think that we can get much worse than we are now but yeah I don't know Carlos can yeah no never challenge Jesse
25:13
on that question Jesse what about you you've thought about this so much yeah look there have been many many proposals
25:19
over the years for how to reform the court uh term limits 18e term limits is one that would give every president two
25:25
appointments per Administration and uh adding justices to the court is another
25:31
idea and obviously in Congress in that case Congress has done that many times that's that's just a matter of federal
25:36
law it has nothing to do with the Constitution but again I think some of that is tinkering around the edges I do
25:43
think how we conceive of the court and how we use our power as Citizens and as
25:50
other governmental actors say in Congress or in state legislatures really matters a lot here and I think to sort
25:56
of throw up our hands and say well this is a uniquely bad court is somewhat giving away our own authority and our
26:02
own power over our government so I would argue for of turning the focus away from the court right now it's never been it's
26:10
never been a great institution it's particularly bad now and I you know I'm I as someone who's tasked with writing
26:17
about it I've been it's been dispiriting over the last several years I never thought the court you know when I
26:22
started at this job the court was had just come off of some of the worst rulings in DEC kids Bush Vore and Shelby
26:30
County eviscerating the Voting Rights Act and Citizens United and yet I still considered the court you know I was
26:36
accepting of its legitimacy I was willing to say okay this is a body that tries to get it right and after what
26:41
happened in 2016 and and the years after that it's very hard to approach the court that way so I've started to sort
26:47
of pull back from the court and think more broadly about the structures of American government and and how they can
26:53
balance it off well that call for um a more engaged C cenry seems like a very
27:00
good place to wrap up our conversation I'm sure that the upcoming Court decisions will prompt lots more
27:05
discussion on these issues of trust and legitimacy so let's take a little break
27:11
and when we come back we will get hot and cold
27:20
[Music]
27:34
[Music] all right it's time for hot cold where uh one of you know what at this point
27:40
everyone knows what it means so I'm just going to say uh and now it is time for hot and cold who's hot colding for us
27:47
this week I got it I got it so I am weirdly warm on dis tracks but
27:53
specifically the recent high-profile beef between the rap Legends Kendrick
27:58
Lamar and Drake I can hear Lydia like breathing heavily right now so look I'm
28:04
not a rap a fish a I'm not g to Pretend This is like what I obsess about I generally limit myself to like Eminem
28:10
and Pitbull who Okay full disclosure I have seen twice in concert but that's about it but this Kendrick Lamar and
28:17
Drake thing has gotten so big even I have gotten sucked in and you know mostly with my college kids insisting on
28:24
playing tracks for me so you know the rap world has always had had its feuds but these guys have said some really
28:31
wretched things about each other and it has dominated the charts these songs have all gone up and it has dominated
28:38
even folks like one of my kids has no interest in rap except this has like
28:44
completely sucked huran and me I am mesmerized by the whole you're all in on the beef so I'm dipping into the way
28:51
back machine here to say that the first thing I thought of when this thing started was like Andy Kaufman and Jerry
28:58
Lawler you know like like these you know these kind of manufactured beefs to like
29:03
get everyone interested and it's not that Kendrick or Drake like not that they need a ton of help in sort of like you know becoming popular and well-known
29:10
artists but um I sort of devolve into cynicism with these kind of stories was
29:15
it fun God yes it is it and I I will say I mean it seems clear um not I mean
29:21
first of all not like us is like a total Banger and I think is going to be the song of the summer I'm stuff why you trolling like a
29:29
ain't you tired trying to strike a cord and it's probably a minor so it's clear that Kendrick Lamar
29:36
has won um but but but you know oh you're GNA get some hate mail the other the other thing that I will say is that
29:43
like the core and substance of this beef is actually like about something real
29:49
which is like authenticity and who actually belongs and the I don't know the the sort of cultural and social
29:56
analysis opportunities that this beef offers up is totally fascinating and there will be PhD dissertations written
30:03
about this beef my 20 year-old can like hold forth on all of kind of the deep
30:09
meaning of this whereas you know my 18-year-old just thinks it's a Bop so yeah by the way is beef the preferred
30:15
nomenclature like everyone says beef that is that is the term you have to use they are beefing they are beefing all
30:20
right get up it's tough for vegetarians but you know um we'll have Jesse tell us whose side he's on later no pick a side
30:27
Jess I I I'm I I'm a as a journalist I gonna express my neutrality on this
30:35
journalist just he's recusing himself he's recusing himself from that's that's what I should have said I recuse myself
30:41
oh my God fine all right well one thing you will never hear on matter of opinion
30:47

30:52
