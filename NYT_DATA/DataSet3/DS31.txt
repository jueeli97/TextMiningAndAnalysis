Can Trump be President? It Depends on How You Define Democracy.


0:00
uh it's a new year well sorry guys I didn't mean to a on that feeling very very Rusty here we're very Rusty may I
0:07
recommend some extra coal medicine yeah my kids couldn't believe like oh you have to go back to doing the
0:13
podcast again yeah from New York Times opinion I'm
0:18
Lydia pgreen I'm Michelle coddle I'm Ross dait and I'm Carlos
0:23
Lozada and this is matter of
0:28
opinion
0:34
it's a new year and it's a big one because we're in an election year that's already consuming headlines and to be
0:40
honest also consuming this podcast alas Colorado Supreme Court and Main's Secretary of State ruled recently that
0:46
Trump is ineligible to be on the ballot joining 30 something states that have lodged some form of challenge to Trump's
0:52
eligibility ultimately this will almost certainly land at the Supreme Court which will have to deliver some kind of
0:58
definitive verdict unsurprisingly not everyone agrees on the Constitutional ground in these cases are based on which
1:04
we'll get into and I have a feeling we don't all agree amongst ourselves either which will be really really fun to talk
1:10
about okay so guys in one sentence what's uh the most significant thing about these cases that you want to talk
1:17
about today um I have been watching America's Finest constitutional Minds go
1:22
back and forth on this so I'm not looking to solve the legal matter today what I want to know is whether the
1:27
Supreme Court is going to make this better or worse when they rule H that was actually the same thing that I
1:33
wanted to raise and not just whether they strike it down or uphold it but how
1:40
they do it whether they do so broadly or narrowly or unanimously or on partisan grounds I think will make a huge
1:47
difference in how it is received interesting Ross how about you I don't
1:52
know I feel like my views on this are so predictable that I'm trying to come up with something unpredictable to say um I
1:59
mean a big fan of these efforts I think it would be great if we had a
2:04
presidential election where we just had secretaries of State sort of deciding
2:12
like maybe the secretary of state of Wisconsin could put me on the ballot for instance that would be that would that
2:18
would be good I think I would do well in crucial uh
2:24
Cru count I I mean it was just a couple podcasts ago in fact that we were
2:30
talking about threats to democracy and someone was talking about the way that
2:37
authoritarian is political parties conspire to keep their opponents off the ballot and I made some sort of joke
2:44
about you know how wouldn't it be terrible if someone was trying to keep a
2:50
candidate a popular candidate off the ballot and I I seem to recall everyone else sort of howling me down and saying
2:56
oh that's just a bunch of nerds speculating on Twitter and now it's not a bunch of nerds speculating on Twitter
3:03
it's the great state of Colorado and the great States your your beloved state of my beloved state of Maine my ancestral
3:10
state of Maine so you know I I I'm not surprised by any of this again you're
3:15
your pro-choice you don't want some judge in Colorado or Maine telling you what to do with your body politic so I
3:22
respect that I respect that I mean I I I don't even know how to begin to respond
3:27
to that Sally Carlos I mean here's sort of a big picture a deeper question here
3:32
is just do you think that the challenge to American democracy is just all about
3:42
Donald Trump himself alone this one guy this distinctive figure this reality TV
3:49
show Proto fascist billionaire whatever and if we can just make him go away things will go back to normal do you
3:56
think that because if you think that then I can see how you start to talk
4:03
yourself into the idea that this is a good idea and you say to yourself look I'm sure that a majority of the
4:09
Republicans on the Supreme Court do not want Donald Trump to be president again so why shouldn't they just wave a magic
4:15
wand and get rid of him Nikki Haley can run the table or maybe DeSantis could make a comeback one of them will beat
4:22
Donald Trump everything will go back to normal and you know that's sort of a view that I had for the first year or so
4:28
of the Trump phenomenon and I think you know I I don't I guess I don't understand how at this point with
4:34
everything we've seen in Europe in North America around the world that you could think of trump as just sort of a force
4:42
that you can just make go away and everything will go back to normal but clearly there are people who think that
4:48
so that's what I'm interested in I guess having again having thought that once myself yeah well you've clearly been on
4:55
a journey here with this Ross and I I a lot I mean for me I think the thing
5:01
that I'm sort of interested to watch how everyone is going to embrace and abandon
5:06
their priors as the situation matches their political needs in this moment I think that uh that will reveal a lot
5:14
about our body politic which uh you know I'm very pro-choice so not an issue for me but but first like let's let's just
5:20
kind of talk through uh a little bit these cases does anyone want to kind of
5:25
make the case for the 14th Amendment interpretation that that Trump shouldn't be on the ballot does anyone want to
5:31
take that on as a thing that they would uh would argue for Can't Be You Ross it can be it can be me why not the
5:38
strongest argument is that the text of the Constitution is clear that you
5:45
cannot hold High public office and the presidency it should be said is not specified but let's assume that it's
5:52
encompassed uh if you have launched an Insurrection or Rebellion against the
5:58
United States of America this applied to Jefferson Davis and former Confederates
6:04
it applies it should be stressed if you have already taken an oath to the Constitution so you know you have to
6:12
have held a significant office already but Donald Trump clearly held a significant office and if you believe
6:20
that the events of the 6th of January are actually an Insurrection in the
6:27
manner envisioned by people trying to exclude ex-confederates from political office in
6:34
the United States then it's sort of an open unshut case right yeah I mean and
6:40
that's the argument that has been made by conservative legal Scholars so what's wrong with that argument why not run
6:45
with it Carlos do you have a a counter to it no I mean I'm I'm torn so Ross you
6:53
wrote a column about this recently and you cited I think um Jonathan chat's argument that you know calling January 6
7:00
and Insurrection is a defensible shorthand maybe in a journalistic sense
7:05
but is not really what happened um he says Trump attempted to secure an
7:10
unelected second term he didn't try to like seize and hold the capital or declare a breakaway Republic just
7:18
because the 14th amendment was created in the aftermath of the civil war with confederate officers in
7:25
mind does not mean that any violation of the amendment must necessarily rise to
7:32
the level of Confederate secessionism to trigger the amendment I don't think that's how laws work laws against murder
7:38
don't mean that the murder has to be committed just the way like Cain killed Abel or something that's a deep cut it's
7:45
a deep cut you don't you don't have to be Charles Ponzi to sort of commit financial fraud and to me what the
7:52
notion that you know this this shouldn't apply that it's not really Insurrection bypasses is I think something
7:59
fundamental about the meaning of the country right think of the oath of office the president takes the president
8:07
swears to the best of his ability to preserve protect and defend the
8:13
Constitution why is that because the Constitution is the country the United
8:18
States is not the United States without its system of government like that's what we are so attempting to overturn
8:25
the Constitution is an attack on the United States Trump does not have to seize the capital the capital building
8:32
the physical building to be an Insurgent his attack on Congress was more fundamental than that it was an attempt
8:38
to render the legislative branch basically meaningless and subservient to the executive so Trump does not need to
8:45
declare a breakaway Republic his Insurrection is against the very system
8:51
of government he has sworn to uphold yeah I mean I think I think that's right
8:56
and I think I have been you know I've been very I would say cool to these interpretations of the 14th Amendment
9:03
just cuz you know I do think that there is something about the American system that's built into the Constitution that
9:10
is in some ways kind of anti-democratic right I mean there are all of these things about our system of government
9:15
that are safeguards against majority rule essentially right we have a senate we have a Electoral College we we have a
9:22
supreme court you know we have we have all of these ways in which we can protect the Constitution from the will
9:29
of of the voters and I guess like looking at the situation that we're in now and this is again coming back to
9:35
this question of you know does Donald Trump represent a unique threat um I I think Donald Trump actually does
9:42
represent a unique threat and um if you look at the sort of opponents that are arrayed against him and their inability
9:48
to defeat him in the Republican primary I I can't help it feel that like if he
9:55
were removed from the political landscape by somay exm that like I don't know that things would
10:01
go back to normal but I think that the temperature would change um now that's not a constitutional argument for doing
10:07
it but um but I do think that in the context of our Constitution and its ability to tolerate and its flexibility
10:14
to rule out these questions of the Ty of majority I actually think that this is an idea that I could get behind Lydia
10:20
the temperature would change and it would get higher yeah no I think that's right like like I don't I don't want
10:26
Trump to be the president the way I'd like that to happen is by him losing
10:32
another election I'd much rather he be defeated in the polls then removed by
10:38
some Deo X makina like this because people aren't going to sort of you know
10:43
take that nor should they we've we've talked about we've talked about switching sides are you switching sides
10:50
car no like I I started off saying I very torn about this yeah I was very torn about this no but like here's the
10:56
thing so Ross you deservedly took lap because the first thing I thought of when I heard of about Colorado was that
11:02
you had said on the podcast that this was going to happen and you you were you were poo pooed now we've talked about
11:08
sort of definitions of democracy on the podcast like the Rock Bottom minimalist notion of democracy is a system that
11:15
elects its leaders through fair and open elections in which the majority of people are empowered to vote for candidates of their choice right when I
11:21
think of that notion of democracy I think Trump should absolutely be allowed to run for president when I think of a
11:28
liberal democracy it gets more complicated because liberal democracy is not just voting in elections it's the
11:34
protection of basic Liberties it's a strong Civil Society it's an independent Judiciary it's robust adherence to the
11:39
rule of law we uphold liberal democracy with a constitution so to me denying someone the right to run based on a
11:46
violation of a provision of the Constitution does not seem to be anti-democratic if it's clear that the
11:53
person in question indeed violated that statute the whole point as Lydia said of
11:58
having a constitution is you set guard rails around democracy to prevent mob rule so did he incite Insurrection in a
12:04
way that would trigger the 14th amendment by his actions on January 6 I kind of believe he did because I watched
12:10
him do it on live TV and because I read the Gen 6 committee report front to back but I don't get to decide if Trump is
12:17
convicted in the federal January 6 case I would be far more inclined to consider
12:22
him and eligible to be on the ballot than I am now so I'm coming at this from
12:27
a kind of meanor perspective and looking mostly at the kind of gross practical Fallout that we could be looking at
12:34
look I tend to believe that the Supreme Court is not going to uphold the
12:41
Colorado decision and so what my question there is is the court going to
12:47
provide any Clarity or closure are they going to rule broadly or are they going
12:52
to rule narrowly my suspicion is that they'll rule narrowly so that he can stay on the ballots but they won't be
12:58
the ones calling any questions about whether or not he engaged in an Insurrection the odds that he is going
13:05
to be stripped of Bot access in any meaningful States look pretty slim and
13:11
so my concern is that what we're teeing up for is a situation where he is going
13:17
to use this as he always does as proof of his victimhood it's not going to have
13:23
a practical difference and it's just going to make
13:29
his case for him and make it all the uglier and divide the country even more
13:35
and convince the tens of millions of people who are teed up to vote for this
13:41
guy that democracy and the system of American democracy you know they
13:47
shouldn't have faith in it that it is you know under attack uh just as he has told them it is now that's not a reason
13:55
for this not to go forward but it is why I am so very interested in what the Supreme Court how they rule again I
14:02
don't believe that they're going to support the Colorado decision but I do believe that there are ways that they could make it more or less toxic I mean
14:10
imagine if the Supreme Court ruled that actually it really is just up
14:17
to every state Secretary of State to decide if someone's guilty of insurrection or not and Justified it
14:23
with some kind of originalist interpretation maybe that would be a brilliant
14:29
no no no of course not right but maybe that would be a brilliant originalist reading of what this means but it would
14:36
be insane it would be ins how long until a state supreme court or Secretary of
14:42
State in a red State attempts to take Joe Biden off the ballot uh due to the crisis at the border right you can V the
14:49
same 14th Amendment and this is where I want to Circle back Carlos to your argument about the president's
14:55
constitutional oath because the reality is that of course presidents in large
15:01
ways and small can be said to violate that oath all the time or at the very least we have constant debates about
15:08
whether this president or that president has betrayed his oath of office through
15:14
claiming extraordinary powers against Congress right presidents not named
15:19
Donald Trump president named George W bush and Barack Obama and for that matter you know Lynden Johnson and FDR
15:26
and Abraham Lincoln have all claimed extra ordinary Powers over and against the legislative branch without being
15:33
guilty of insurrection the reason there's any case here at all I think is
15:39
that there really was a riot Trump did not explicitly incite the riot but
15:46
clearly encouraged it and liked that it happened and you could imagine a world
15:51
where there was evidence that Trump had personally planned the riot and that he
15:57
really did want them to take Mike Pence hostage and make him vote a certain way and that kind of would be an actual
16:03
literal Insurrection but you can't get to that
16:09
from what he did what he did was really bad it was really bad but it was not
16:16
actually a planned attempt to replace the government of the United States by
16:22
force it just was not whatever else it was as bad as it was and I think that
16:28
has to be the standard does it have to be by force well yes the standard is basically it needs to be it needs to be
16:35
a like Confederate style I mean it could be small it could be it could be smaller I think if Donald Trump had or not even
16:42
smaller it could be a different kind of thing if Donald Trump had ordered the military to seize the capital building
16:48
and declare him president that would reasonably count and what Trump trump
16:54
was trying to machinate himself into to some kind of weird 1876 style scenario
17:02
where Congress would vote him back into the presidency and that was bad and
17:07
corrupt but 1876 was not an Insurrection right I mean what we have fundamentally
17:14
problem here is the idea that whether or not he participated in an Insurrection has not been definitive that case has
17:20
not been definitively made to the satisfaction of the majority of American public and so you have to look in
17:27
addition to the legal the at the particulars which is that even with the Colorado case I think there was a lot of
17:35
questions about whether they just kind of glossed over that whole oh well he's guilty of insurrection so he can't be on
17:40
the ballot as opposed to going through all the nitty-gritty of whether you know of proving that he was guilty of
17:46
participating in an Insurrection well and it's interesting right because I think there are sort of two points that that bubble to mind as you're talking
17:53
Michelle one is that you know the times own polling has shown that if Trump were
17:58
to be convicted that it actually could cost him support even among Republicans um so actually being convicted of a
18:05
crime could be meaningful to his electoral hopes and the other thing though is that the the qualifications
18:11
for running for president are laid out in the Constitution and you know you could be in prison you could be a
18:18
convicted felon you could be you know any of those things and Trump can still run he can still be voted for as a as a
18:25
resident of Florida if he's a a convicted felon he himself might not be able to vote in his State and that's to
18:31
me like a kind of fascinating Paradox of all any random Loser run for a pres or even be president you can be a complete
18:38
fonus loser and you can still be president I think that's a great place
18:43
to end this part of the conversation let's take a quick break and we'll be right back to talk about the other news
18:49
to come this year there's other news I [Music]
18:57
know
19:02
[Music]
19:14
and we're back and now we're going to zoom out Beyond Trump thank goodness and
19:19
share what other stories could qualify for our 2024 Bingo cards so Michelle you
19:25
closed out the year with a delightful column on the best worst and weirdest political stories from 2023 you covered
19:32
a wild and historic turnover in house leadership criminal indictments George
19:37
Santos George RP miss that guy so what story are you going to be watching most
19:42
in 2024 like everybody else I'll be on the presidential campaign trail of sorts
19:48
but I also have a couple of early dramas up on the hill that I'm looking at one is I'm interested to see whether speaker
19:56
Johnson is going to Usher us into to a government shutdown as of right now the
20:01
word is that they're making progress on cutting a deal that will extend or avoid
20:09
having a shutdown based on the stop Gap measures they passed late last year the thing that looks less promising is how
20:16
they're going to resolve the Border crisis tied to Aid free Ukraine the
20:22
Republicans have shifted the usual drama which is border security combined with
20:31
immigration reform generally and it's now kind of border security tied to
20:36
money for Ukraine and that is a really Sticky Wicket the question is what will
20:44
the final negotiations look like you know how much tougher will Asylum standards get how much will par issues
20:53
be changed there's a lot of different pieces with the Border crisis that have to be dealt with in order for this to
21:00
move forward and that's not looking so hot right now globally the question of immigration migration Asylum all of it
21:07
is going to be a huge story I'm sure that all of us are going to be paying attention to how about you Carlos what's on your agenda you know I'm I'm sure
21:14
you'll say I'm playing to type um you have some books that you're going to read that too but no I'm going to be
21:20
following the economy um no but but but not but it strikes me Economist it's
21:26
kind of fascinating to me that a president bid who came to office pledging to defend democracy who has
21:31
staked his re-election campaign on that same fight is going to see his election
21:36
rise and fall based on the strength of the economy and on perceptions of the strength of the economy so I'll be
21:43
interested not just in the sort of like indicators sense of the economy but the way Biden chooses to talk about it and
21:50
campaign on it I'm also just interested in how the Republican field does or does not fall in line inevitably behind Trump
21:57
I think it it'll say a lot about the future of the party and it just reminds me of that moment when all the Democrats
22:03
fell in line behind Joe Biden after South Carolina and I I wonder when that'll happen precisely on the other
22:09
side this time you know it's the the daily did an episode recently about sort of Donald Trump's reelect strategy and I
22:15
mean there was a lot of stuff about his like blood and soil nationalism and Echoes of of hitlerian language but
22:22
there was a moment in there where they played a clip of him talking about mortgage rates in the economy and as
22:27
someone who just bought a home and took out a mortgage I could tell you that the perception that things are really tough
22:33
because mortgage rates are so much higher than they were just a few years ago I mean it does have this kind of
22:40
like kick you in the guts feeling that can override all of the other economic news so I think you're right Carlos that
22:45
like that's going to be really interesting to watch this year and um housing mortgage rates all that kind of stuff is like a it's it's just going to
22:51
be a huge thing for everyone's pocketbooks even bleeding heart liberals like me um Ross how about you what are you watching I mean I'm a little worried
22:59
about the collapse of the American Empire in 2024 a little there's a a
23:05
really good piece by a British writer named Aris rinos in unheard called the world should fear
23:13
2024 and if you want to be super anxious about world affairs uh you should read
23:19
it um because his argument is basically that even just relative to a year or so
23:27
ago American power is just really strained on a lot of fronts the Ukrainian War
23:34
seems to be turning back against the ukrainians the Israel Gaza situation
23:40
does not appear to be likely to be resolved anytime soon with the dangers of a wider War hanging over everything
23:47
we can't keep the Red Sea shipping lanes open at the moment because of attacks by
23:53
the houthis in Yemen and all these are the kinds of problems that can be
23:59
managed we are managing them I worry about the chaos of an election year
24:06
basically encouraging revisionist powers to to sort of roll the dice with China and
24:11
Taiwan being the big example I don't think it's super likely but it's
24:17
something yeah it's something that I worry about and the overall number of pressure points on the American Le World
24:26
Order is going up as we head into what promises to be an exciting domestic
24:32
political drama yeah I mean I think the intertwining of the domestic and international is going to be for me a
24:38
big theme too I mean it's striking right because the number of Elections that are going to be happening this year across
24:43
the globe is just astonishing I think it's about 40% of the world's population essentially will be will be going to the
24:50
polls this year and some very very important countries and I'll be watching India obviously there's going to be very
24:56
important elections in Europe and it doesn't sound sexy but the European Parliament elections I think will be a
25:01
really interesting Roar shock test super sexy but you know that is the place where I I think of them as like our
25:07
Schoolboard elections where you like the real sort of like narrowcast freak agendas get played out and so I think
25:14
it's going to be very interesting to see how that interesting not not necessarily in a good way and we have an election in Taiwan we have an election a few in a
25:20
few days a few days which think it's going to be really really before we go to that I just want to go to the one
25:26
thing that I'm very very terrified about that uh no one has mentioned into the theme of Ross oh there's going to be a
25:32
briefing we should talk about that uh UFOs obviously um that's something to celebrate not be terrified about come on
25:38
we we're we're coming to the good news we're coming to the good news part it could go anyway but just to go back to
25:43
Ross's Doom and Gloom about the American Le order I'm a little freaked out about what's happening in Pakistan just to
25:49
remind our listeners Pakistan is a country with nuclear warheads it's
25:54
already been the site of nuclear proliferation there is a very fragile caretaker government in place there
26:01
right now there's an election this year it is a very very messy political situation and they have now the Taliban
26:08
in Afghanistan breathing down their neck the Viper that the Pakistani government created in order to extend its influence
26:15
is now coming back to bite them and we could be facing a very real possibility
26:20
of a kind of Jihadi government having nuclear weapons so just add that to your
26:26
europeo part of things terrible terrible things that could happen in 2024 so uh
26:31
but yeah let's let's come back Taiwan China like that another another fearful possibility no I was just going to say that your scenario as well Lydia is a
26:38
great reminder that conflicts and Wars don't like wait patiently in line for
26:44
their turn just because we have Ukraine just because we have Israel and Hamas
26:50
doesn't mean that we can't have more okay does anybody have anything optimistic to say well sure it's always
26:57
always the years no history is unpredictable and it's always the years that you expect one damn after that turn
27:04
out to be actually pretty chill and amazing and maybe um that Biden boom is
27:10
just around the corner maybe there'll be peace in Ukraine maybe the stalemate will induce an Armistice China doesn't
27:18
really want to attack Taiwan right now come on right and I'm try I'm struggling
27:24
to say something optimistic about about the middle least but um you know God
27:31
loves us all how about that that's the best you got today Ross that's the best
27:36
I've got every day Michelle I mean I my wish on you know let's say January 3rd
27:43
2025 is to listen back to this episode and say thank God none of those worst
27:49
case scenarios happened and we made it through 2024 there's been no nuclear
27:56
proliferation to a Jihadi group there's been no war between Taiwan and China but yeah I think this year is going to be a
28:02
tough one and I I don't know I'm looking forward to making lots of great podcasts talking about it with all of you yes we
28:09
can come here and whine about everything as the year goes by done that's good okay let's leave it there when we come
28:15
back hot and [Music]
28:26
cold [Music]
28:36
[Music] and finally it's time for hot cold and
28:42
because it's a new year and we hope that brings new listeners I'll explain the conceit every week one of us shares
28:49
something or into over or somewhere in between so who's got the hot cold this week so I'm going to ring in the New
28:56
Year and and one thing regular listeners know is that we usually don't do the
29:01
somewhere in between option we're almost all you know genuinely hot or genuinely
29:07
cold we have opinions but I I have a lukewarm take over the Christmas holiday
29:13
my wife and I finished watching the crown on Netflix and I watch a fair
29:18
amount of Television but I I generally have a kind of a pretty high bar for
29:24
things that I stick with like if a show has you know one good season and three
29:29
Bad seasons I'm usually out of there by the end of the first Bad season and I don't watch a lot of shows where I'm
29:36
like meh you know B minus or something but I watched the entire run of the
29:42
crown this was a lot a lot of episodes over many years multiple actresses
29:47
playing Elizabeth II and at the end of it I was like I'm just incredibly
29:52
lukewarm about this show were you m all the way through or did you go up and down and up and down and I mean there
29:59
were good EP there I was there were better episodes and worse episodes and part of what kept me with it was that
30:06
the worst episodes were never that bad and when it turned over to a new episode
30:12
often there would be something interesting and I really you know it's a good case study in sort of how to how to
30:18
sort of hook a viewer and hold them for a long period of time without ever sort
30:24
of fully justifying the expense and great acting and so on that was lavished
30:31
on this story did any of you guys watch the show I haven't finished the last episodes but I think the thing that kept me coming back is just so nice to look
30:38
at you know like ravishing like the Scottish Countryside The Outfits the
30:43
things you know in my mind the crown goes down as like you know something pretty to look at uh learn some fun
30:51
things in the early episodes some quite good performances But ultimately ultimately kind of a failure the last
30:57
thing I'll say is just that there is I think my lukewarmness reflects sort of the an uncertainty that is connected to
31:04
the monarchy itself right which is the show is about the survival of the monarchy embodied in this really you
31:12
know in certain ways quite remarkable woman who gave her whole life fully and completely for its survival but the show
31:19
itself at the end can't quite decide what was that for so right so maybe
31:25
maybe in a sense the lukewarmness is B up in the uncertainty about why this archaic thing has been
31:32
preserved and what its ultimate Destiny will be which you know could be the
31:37
restoration of royal power in the chaos of the collapse of the American Empire and there you have it I know King Donald
31:44
Trump Happ 2024 all connects oh all right guys um wonderful to see you all
