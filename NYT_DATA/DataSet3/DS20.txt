0:04
Carlos Lozada we're working on our next
0:06
episode for you but while you wait I
0:08
wanted to share something else a piece
0:10
from fellow matter of opinion co-host
0:12
Lydia pgreen Lydia's been following the
0:15
crisis unfolding in Haiti and she shared
0:17
her thoughts about it in an audio essay
0:19
it's really smart and it's even a
0:21
hopeful take on a very difficult
0:23
situation so here it

Who is Lydia
0:32
my name is Lydia pgreen and I'm an
0:34
opinion columnist for the New York
0:37
Times I think you have a lot of people
0:39
in Haiti who are ready at this moment to
0:41
help build this new future and really
0:44
what they need is financial support
0:47
security support and also like the time
0:49
and space to build their own ideas of
0:52
what a future Haiti could look like and
0:55
just because there is this long history
0:57
of failure doesn't mean that success is
1:00
not
1:01
possible I've been traveling to Haiti as
1:05
a journalist since
1:07
2003 it was actually the first big
1:09
International assignment that I was ever
1:11
asked to do and it began I think a
1:14
decades Long Engagement with the story
1:16
of Haiti and its struggle for
1:19
self-determination for security for
1:21
dignity and just a deep interest in the
1:23
lives and culture of the Haitian

The Haiti Crisis
1:28
people you know whenever you're talking
1:31
about Haiti it's hard to know where to
1:32
begin the story because obviously the
1:35
country was born in this extraordinary
1:37
active Liberation you know way back in
1:39
the 19th century but this most recent
1:42
crisis I think is worth just sort of
1:43
taking on its own terms and it really
1:46
began with the assassination of hadi's
1:49
President a man called jovenal moiz who
1:52
was assassinated in July of
1:54
2021 the gunman broke into the home of
1:57
Haiti's president early this morning
1:59
then shot are
2:01
fired the assassination just really
2:03
threw the country into total disarray in
2:05
addition to the political crisis
2:07
kidnappings for ransom have surged in
2:09
recent months and Haiti just hasn't been
2:11
able to recover since then you know it's
2:14
had an appointed prime minister a man
2:15
named Ariel HRI ostensively has been the
2:18
head of the government but for the past
2:20
3 years has not been able to organize
2:23
new elections to return Haiti to
2:25
democracy he's become a very unpopular
2:27
figure the Civil Society organizations
2:30
and political parties and others have
2:32
been pushing him to resign and then he
2:35
was also facing pressure from these
2:38
armed groups that have popped up in
2:40
Haiti and have been a very very big part
2:43
of the crisis because you know there's
2:45
just real kind of like lawlessness and
2:48
violence happening in the streets and
2:50
under some pressure from various
2:51
Regional leaders and of course the
2:53
internal pressure within Haiti he did
2:55
agree to
2:58
resign
Global Context
3:01
it's hard to talk about a crisis in
3:02
Haiti without thinking about the kind of
3:04
broader Global context the United States
3:07
has metled and interfered they've
3:09
invaded they've occupied they've
3:11
sanctioned they've restored leaders
3:14
they've backed dictators they've tried
3:16
to bring democracy back and it's a
3:17
constant back and forth almost to the
3:20
point where it's sometimes hard to draw
3:21
a line of like where the United States
3:23
policy and action ends and where sort of
3:25
Haitian agency
3:28
begins
What We owe Haiti
3:31
you know the question of what we owe
3:33
Haiti now I think is is a really complex
3:35
one and I don't think that there's an
3:36
easy
3:38
answer where I ultimately come down is
3:41
that if in the past the United States
3:43
has had a kind of paternalistic attitude
3:46
towards Haiti where you're kind of
3:48
trying to tell what Haiti what to do
3:49
tell Haiti how it should be governed who
3:51
should be in charge that the role that
3:54
the US should play Now is really more of
3:55
a
3:57
midwife and it's a role of supporting
4:00
and creating an environment in which
4:02
Haitians themselves can determine their
4:04
own
4:06
future I think every American needs to
4:09
understand that Haiti is not some
4:11
separate thing from the United States
4:13
our Fates our stories our histories are
4:17
deeply deeply
4:18
intertwined the United States owes I
4:22
believe a deep debt to Haiti and so much
4:25
of the story of what Haiti has become is
4:27
a story of our misdeeds and actions over
4:31
many many years so there's a historic
4:34
debt there also one thing that you'll
4:37
often hear people say when they say why
4:39
we should care about what happens in
4:40
Haiti they'll often talk about migration
4:42
there is a very very ugly history of
4:45
using Haitians as a kind of Boogeyman
4:49
and deportations continue but I think
4:52
that it goes even deeper than that
4:53
during the early days of the AIDS crisis
4:55
for example when people would talk about
4:57
who has HIV and AIDS it would be
5:00
homosexuals Haitians and
5:03
hemophiliacs the United States has a lot
5:04
to answer for in terms of the
5:06
relationship that we've had with Haiti
5:08
over a very very long time and they're
5:10
part of our
A fresh start for Haiti
5:15
story over the last couple of years I've
5:17
been tracking these conversations with
5:19
various political groups and Civic
5:20
groups and religious groups that have
5:22
just been working tirelessly to come up
5:24
with a blueprint for what a just
5:26
transition in Haiti back towards
5:28
democracy might look like
5:30
and the one thing that was really
5:31
standing in their way was the the Prime
5:34
Minister was refusing to step down and
5:36
look now uh he's gone and there's an
5:38
opportunity to take all of that
5:41
incredibly difficult and hard work that
5:43
these people have done and imagine a new
5:46
and different future for Haiti and
5:48
that's something thing that gives me a
5:49
sense of hope there are lots and lots
5:51
and lots of problems on the horizon
5:52
there are lots of things that could
5:53
derail it but this is a moment for a
5:56
fresh start for a country that Des needs
