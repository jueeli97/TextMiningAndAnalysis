Untangling the Mess of Campus Protests


0:00
thank you for your ruthlessness Michelle you're you're like such a great gentle we should make you the president of Columbia
0:07
University inan Michelle's repressive Society it's going to look very different out there everywhere not just
0:15
Columbia from New York Times opinion I'm Michelle coddle I'm Ross doit and I'm
0:20
Lydia pgreen and this is matter of opinion
0:31
right sadly our beloved Carlos is out this week and Ross has a filthy head
0:36
cold nevertheless we will press on this just means that Lydia and I will have to talk extra which should be exciting
0:44
because today I want to talk about the college protests that are taking place across the country the situation has
0:49
gotten quite political on and off campus and it's getting increasingly
0:55
contentious so I want to get everyone's thoughts on what the lasting effect these campus protests is going to be for
1:02
academic institutions and more broadly just for our politics but to kick us off
1:08
I want to get down into the Weeds on the campuses and Lydia you spent a lot of time reporting on the protests at
1:15
Colombia last week so you want to tell us what you saw yeah I have sort of an unusual vantage point on this whole
1:22
situation I just happened to be at Colombia two weeks ago I was speaking at a class the day that the president of
1:27
Columbia Manu shaik decided to call in the NYPD um I saw the encampment you
1:33
know was a bunch of kids hanging out chanting various slogans none of which seemed particularly utree to me but um I
1:41
you know was sort of stunned to see an hour later that they had decided to bring in the NYPD and those same arrested students I
1:49
caught up with a few hours later because I live a block from Police Headquarters which is where they take protesters and
1:55
process them and then kind of release them so I've had a chance to spend it a bit of time and and do a fair bit of
2:01
reporting and then return to Columbia campus and you know it's clear that there is a really really really strong
2:09
and motivated movement out there for people who are really really upset about what's happening in Gaza and want their
2:16
universities and institutions to listen to their demands for various things like divesting their endowments changing
2:22
other policies and you know I think a lot of people are asking you know are these protests motivated by
2:28
anti-Semitism are they are they violent uh I didn't see any violence I think anti-Semitism is it seems silly to try
2:35
and pretend that there is absolutely none anywhere in any of these protest movements but you know these seemed like
2:41
pretty peaceful pretty chill student protests that seems to have changed in the last 24 hours just in the sense that
2:48
both you know at Colombia where a group of students took over a very famous Hall on campus and then also around the
2:54
country where there are lots and lots of other protests going on there have been in some cases is really violent counter
3:01
protests so things do seem to be getting more and more hectic and where this goes
3:06
next is anybody's guess but it seems really really really bad so we've seen these college administrators who are in
3:13
the middle of all this trying to figure out what to do what role to play and
3:18
different schools are responding in different ways I mean do you guys think that any of them have responded notably
3:27
well and there's silence well I you mean broken only by a a rasp I mean I I guess
3:35
my general view of this situation is that it's sort of an extension of the
3:41
problem that universities have been struggling with ever since the Hamas
3:48
massacres in Israel and the war in Gaza began there is this long tradition of
3:55
left-wing student protest at most elite American univers ities Colombia very
4:01
much included that over the course of the last 50 or 60 years has been sort of burnished and romanticized as a kind of
4:09
essential aspect of what it means to be a politically engaged college student so you have that view joined with the sense
4:16
that I think really built up in the Last 5 Years on universities that when people
4:22
are protesting in the name of anti-racism anti-colonialism a lot of
4:28
the ideas that in form protesters against Israel's war in Gaza they're
4:33
sort of assumed to be right and have a lot of moral Authority and I think that
4:39
universities sort of carried that assumption for instance throughout the George Floyd protests that whatever
4:44
rules might be broken students were basically in the right but in this case Israel and Gaza the universities
4:51
themselves are just deeply divided and so schools are stuck in a way having on
4:56
the one hand this idea of protest in General and leftwing protest in
5:01
particular as something that has to be given a certain degree of deference but also having this particular issue create
5:09
unusual divisions on campus where lots and lots of people who would have deferred to a different kind of leftwing
5:15
protest don't want to defer because they think the pro Palestinian protesters
5:21
whether or not they're anti-semitic are just wrong so it's a mess definitely it's a mess but then there's also just
5:26
like the sort of practical Tactical questions you know Northwestern University took a pretty conciliatory
5:33
stance and they just negotiated with the students and then ended up disbanding the encampment after discussions Wesley
5:39
and also decided not to you know bring in the cup yeah Brown has done it right Berkeley you see Berkeley so there are
5:45
lots of schools that decided to talk their way out of this and and look I don't like to play the game of who
5:51
started it because it's truly a childish game but like the question of who escalated this particularly in the case
5:58
of Colombia you know what was Manu shafik thinking calling in the NYPD it
6:04
just didn't make any sense and it threw gas on the fire you started to see more encampments happening in places where
6:10
they weren't happening before this whole thing kind of spreads like wildfire and now we have a much much much bigger
6:17
political configuration and I don't know I'm not a parent but like the university
6:22
if it's in locco parentis if you're calling the cops on your kids like you're you're really not doing a great
6:28
job so I guess I I really struggle to understand like how how they have failed
6:34
to deescalate here well I definitely want us to drill down into kind of what happens when these outside forces that
6:41
are beyond the campus come into play but first I want to take a step back I mean
6:46
like Ross is talking about the romanticizing of protests although it is
6:51
notable that you're talking about Columbia being famous for you know being the sight of a lot of protests over the
6:57
years you know in the late 60s when protesters took this over they called the police in they dragged those
7:03
protesters out downstairs and arrested hundreds of people right this is not like some
7:11
consequence-free thing and then and then like later they shot and killed four college students at Kent State I mean
7:18
you know I don't think we look back on that and think oh yeah they really sorted that out and then furthermore I
7:23
don't think we look back at any of these so-called leftwing student protests and think oh they were on the wrong side of
7:29
things they really shouldn't have been protesting against apartheid or that Vietnam War we really could have won that I mean there there I can think of
7:36
some student protests that I don't think were correct but but those are the big examples right yeah I mean I I think
7:42
there were real crackdowns on anti-vietnam protests that then most
7:48
people involved in higher education decided had been on the right side of history and then when the divestment
7:55
protest came around I believe there were fewer crackdowns these are the the protests especially in the 1980s urging
8:02
universities to divest from South Africa which are one of the models invoked here
8:08
and then again I think in the last 5 years or so especially in the Trump era especially in 2020 there's just been an
8:15
assumption that the protesters are the voice of conscience and so on but that
8:22
landscape has shifted and and the example of these outside forces is is
8:27
part of it right that politicians in Washington DC have sort of woken up to
8:32
the fact that I mean the Baseline here is that these universities are incredibly Rich they're like huge you
8:38
know corporate entities that manage a huge hedge fund and also teach some classes right oh and don't forget the
8:44
real estate also has a huge real estate portfolio real estate manages a real estate portfolio right and politicians
8:51
especially Republican politicians but not only them have sort of woken up to the fact that when there protests on
8:57
these campuses that they constituents don't like in fact these really rich
9:03
institutions get a lot of money and tax breaks from the federal government and are therefore political like it's
9:10
Congress does not stand fully outside the modern University it's in there in its own way so again it's a mess I'm
9:16
just going to end every statement I make with it's a mess it's yeah I mean it's definitely a mess but I also think that
9:22
one of the questions that I've been asking is what exactly is a university now you know last night I was at a
9:28
dinner with a group of professors from NYU in Colombia and these are professors who are sort of long tenur and they were
9:35
asking this question and saying like there was a time when it felt as though professors and students were the heart
9:42
of the university and the decisions and the conversations and the debates that
9:48
happened there were the ones that mattered and the thing that I think is just so striking about this situation is
9:54
that this seems to be a conversation that's happening almost outside of the University it was notable to me that the
10:01
president of Colombia sent a letter to the NYPD requesting them to come in but
10:07
repeatedly professors and students of Colombia said our campus is being raided and we have not received any email or
10:14
any kind of communication from the administration of the University so it's almost like there's this conversation
10:21
that's going on between Congress and the university administration led by the president and the trustees who generally
10:28
are just very very very rich and and often highly politically connected people that just feels like totally
10:34
disconnected from what you would assume is the heart of a university which is students and faculty yeah I mean have um
10:42
no go ahead Ross no go ahead a couple things one like talking to my kids I have a 20-year-old at Boulder which is
10:47
you know not like Colombia in its hot bed of liberal activism but like he has
10:54
a lot of sympathy to the complications of the situation in Gaza but when they
10:59
started arresting students he's like what is with the overreaction so you
11:05
have a complicated issue but then when it starts escalating you drive people
11:10
into camps and you drive this polarization and while I am extremely sympathetic to Ross's point that
11:18
conservatives and Republicans have seen college and Academia in general as kind of a hostile environment I think there's
11:24
just no way that speaker of the house Mike Johnson and other lawmakers from both parties might mind you have any
11:30
business touring Columbia and other campuses they just they just don't why not because it just makes it worse if
11:37
what you're trying to do is get past this and not turn it into a national
11:43
issue but why don't they have a right to turn it into a national issue they they do have the right Ross there's a
11:48
difference between what you can do and what you should do but what I am saying is put yourself in the position of a
11:55
normal Republican for a minute of you know whom you know a few these are are incredibly Rich it's not just
12:00
Republicans who are doing this the Democrats are touring as well you you have incredibly wealthy powerful
12:07
institutions whose self-professed job is to educate the American Elite that receive large sums of money and tax
12:14
breaks from the federal government and you have an opportunity to shift to exploit the situation for yeah that's
12:21
what politics is if you think Harvard and Yale and Columbia CU they know it's not going to solve the underlying
12:27
situation all they're trying to do campaign arm of Congress is selling
12:33
Hamas t-shirts in response to this how responsible is that the actual policy
12:40
that some of these Republicans would like to do is to raise the tax on big endowments that seems totally
12:46
responsible and reasonable to me yeah but that's not what they're doing with this yes they're also trying to win
12:52
elections and they're doing it on the backs of college students and if that's that's fine as long as we're very clear
12:58
about that they don't care about these okay well let's talk about the college students for a minute since we can we
13:04
can get wound up a little bit here so I agree the Columbia president's decision was a bad decision to send in the NYPD
13:10
why did she make that decision I would say presumably because a number of Jewish students and probably their
13:17
parents expressed a feeling of not being safe on their campuses now I have not
13:22
walked around the protests but i' I've walked around the protests in New Haven so I'm not going to tell you how much h
13:29
H ility to Jewish students there is in these protests I I don't think we're going to you know exactly quantify it
13:36
there certainly is some hostility to Jewish students in that context those students are also stakeholders in the
13:42
university and that is the explanation for why universities are taking these actions well well well hang hang on hang
13:49
on a second I mean I I did go and and speak to a number of Jewish students who are inside the encampment and I you know
13:54
I just want to say I'm not Jewish none of us here are Jewish I don't presume to represent or or speak about like the way
14:01
any person is experiencing this like what I've tried to do is actually just talk to people about what they're thinking and feeling and I've scoured
14:08
and scoured and scoured and looked for people who were on the receiving end of actual anti-semitic statements or
14:15
threats or things like that and and what I heard was a very real genuine sense of
14:21
being upset from Jewish students who are not participating in the encampments and there there are a number of Jewish
14:26
students who are participating in the encampments but I don't think this is a question that you can ultimately like solve in some kind of objective way
14:32
there's not like a kind of anti-Semitism detector that's just going to Ding and tell you yes this is anti-Semitic
14:37
therefore it's out of bounds or no it's not therefore it's okay all of these things are in the eye of the beholder
14:43
and so I think that we're really at this place where we have to take seriously the feelings of these students who feel
14:49
hurt upset perhaps unsafe and I talked to students who felt that way but I think that we also have to take that
14:55
feeling seriously in the context of many students who have very very strong feelings about what's going on in in
15:02
Gaza and also Muslim Students Arab students Palestinian students who feel like they've had Targets on their backs
15:09
since October 7th so there are a lot of feelings to be managed in this situation and there's a lot of there's a lot of
15:15
people feeling threatened so again I want to say this is an example of the point I'm making which is that yes it
15:22
turns out that the world is very complicated but colleges have been making decisions for many years on the
15:29
basis of the idea that if a group of students expresses a sense of threat
15:34
grievance a feeling of being oppressed that you defer to them and so now colleges are in a position where you
15:40
have converging and conflicting arguments along those lines and it's
15:46
just the system that colleges have put in place doesn't know how to manage that
15:51
that's one point a second Point again I have not reported on the Columbia encampments I have however been teaching
15:58
CL classes at Yale for the last two semesters so I have had a lot of contact with students including Jewish students
16:05
at Yale after October 7th and we don't even have to debate anti-Semitism versus
16:12
non- anti-Semitism we can just say that in the aftermath of October 7th on Elite
16:18
college campuses there were expressions of support for and solidarity with the
16:24
actions of Hamas that killed a lot of Jews I think that that is a reasonable
16:30
General situation in which Jewish students could feel threatened in a way that goes beyond the normal level of
16:38
sort of threat discourse on these campuses now are protesters at Colombia
16:44
wearing t-shirts with hang gliders on them like or in what numbers you know our invocations of solidarity how often
16:51
does someone say glory to our Martyrs like never heard once age well let's let's agree then that we're not going to
16:57
quantify this however we do have for instance the example of kammani James
17:02
who's one of the student leaders I'm not going to say he's the only student leader one of the student leaders at
17:08
Columbia University's encampment who has said a lot of things about zionists and
17:15
their right to life compared them right vile things right and if you imagined a
17:20
world where this was a prot trump encampment and there was videos
17:26
circulating of leaders doing sort of Q andon stuff and the kman James stuff is
17:31
like leftwing Q andon level stuff talking about how we're going to purge the Deep Spate and put everybody to death and so on no one on the left would
17:39
be talking about how well you know there's a lot of conflicting claims of victimization like no people would be
17:45
apeshit about that and again the reason part of the university is freaked out
17:51
and part of it is freaked out in the other direction is that this is an issue that doesn't just fall into the usual
17:57
Left Right divisions it's an intal liberal argument and universities don't know how to deal with it maybe maybe
18:03
first of all I think there's just been absolute and Universal condemnation of this college student who said these
18:09
terrible things I have not seen anyone in a position of authority set up to to defend him but you know it is
18:14
interesting I mean like when I was reporting out the column that I wrote about Colombia I went back and looked at some of the things that were said on the
18:20
Colombia campus when American young people were dying by their thousands in
18:25
Vietnam these were chants that were quoted in the Columbia spect Ator one side's right one side's wrong we're on
18:31
the side of the Viet Kong save Hanoi lose Saigon Victory to the Viet Kong I mean that's a good example of how many
18:38
anti-vietnam protesters were not on the correct side no of course right they were not on the correct side it because
18:44
it was bad that the Viet Kong Won right no but but but do we agree on that was it was it good or bad that the Viet Kong
18:51
won the my point is it was bad but but what I will say what I will say is that
18:57
from 1968 till the end of the war 38,000 American soldiers died in Vietnam
19:03
countless countless countless people in Cambodia and Vietnam and La died as well and we were fighting a pointless
19:09
unwinable war that the Pentagon knew was pointless and unwinable at that point our public officials were lying to us
19:16
about it I just really really feel like I understand the motivations of the students here even if some of their
19:23
tactics and I personally am repelled by some of their tactics are gross
19:31
we'll be right [Music]
19:46
back so I don't want to get too specific to Colombia because this has spread all
19:51
over the country not just Elite colleges what should the college administrators
19:57
do and and I think Ross you are on to something here with your first point they've made this bed to some degree
20:03
because there has been this sense in a lot of colleges that if somebody says something that makes you
20:10
uncomfortable then that is a terrible kind of situation and needs to be addressed in a way that is not easily
20:16
dealt with in this particular circumstance that said you got all these college campuses you've got all these
20:23
administrators what should they be doing I think that University should use
20:28
discretion there's a difference between an encampment that creates hassles and inconvenience and the Takeover of a
20:36
building and I'm okay with what you know as far as we can tell what Colombia did
20:41
with the building takeover sending in the police to take the students out I'm fine with that I don't think it was a good idea to send the police into the
20:48
initial encampment so that's where I would draw the line and then obviously like when your encampment is inside a
20:54
library or something right then I'm not sure but I think there's a difference between occupying public space in a sort
21:02
of problematic way and taking over buildings which is a more violent kind
21:08
of act especially the way it actually went down it is reasonable for universities to have a policy that
21:14
allows protests and says if you break University rules at a certain point while protesting we will use physical
21:21
restraint to prevent you from breaking those rules all right ldia what about you yeah I mean look again I come back
21:26
to this question of what is a university right a university is a place you know where you send not quite fully formed
21:33
young people to essentially like learn stuff and grow up right they're very
21:38
delicate ecosystems and they're they're essentially communities and we're all genxers right so we had you know a
21:45
different experience of what it was to be in the University than I think what we have now and I mean look I would
21:50
agree with Ross that this sort of I don't know maybe I'm mischaracterizing but this kind of hegemonic you know
21:56
University Administration like vampire squid that is attached to a giant hedge
22:02
fund and and these real estate holdings that is fundamentally I think a Corruption of what these communities
22:08
should be and part of the problem of why we're having these kinds of disconnects
22:14
right like this is why I invoke the idea of like calling the cops on your kids because like I don't get the sense that
22:20
you know and again I keep speaking about Columbia because that's the one that I know best because I've spent the most time there and I'm also an alumnist of the journalism school there but like I
22:27
just don't get the the sense that the administration of Colombia is thinking about this as a kind of organic
22:34
Community as opposed to a legally structured Corporation you know in a
22:41
family there's give and take right there's a sense of compromise and discussion and so I I think the question
22:47
that I would ask is like how do we get our institutions of Higher Learning back to being those kinds of communities and
22:54
not being these kind of weird bureaucratic quasy you know quasi
23:00
corporate very much influenced by politics places and this is and this is the point of convergence where we just
23:06
needs once the Republicans defund the universities then they can return to the
23:12
kind of organic you know scholarly activist communities that Lydia wants them to
23:17
be Achi un only speaker Mike Johnson can save the modern University can bring us
23:25
together but but this brings us back to the point of whatever is happening with these protests whatever happens once all
23:31
these dorms shut down for the summer and all these kids go off to their jobs or internships or whatever this is going to
23:38
be echoing in the political realm especially during this campaign year we've already seen Donald Trump come out
23:44
and say are these kids going to be treated like the January 6 protesters
23:49
this is not going away on a big p political level so what's the best case
23:55
scenario you guys see for this going for forward versus really what's going to happen which we all know is going to be
24:01
really ugly and divisive well the wonderful thing about the academic year is it has these built-in kind of
24:06
pressure release valves there are breaks kids go home so so in terms of what happens to the students I mean one of
24:11
the things that's really striking to me is how scared these students are of facial recognition of being essentially
24:18
doxed and their entire Futures being essentially foreclosed by being identified and put on the side of a van
24:25
driven around New York City and I think you're starting to some of them want to join the vampire
24:30
squid yes because because Bros they're college kids right I mean
24:36
they're one can have a conscience and also want to like you know be part of the world right like these are not
24:42
either or and I guess that's my point is like is these are young people who are like we believe that this is a just
24:48
cause but we also believe that we're living in this insanely polarized time and like you know Bill Amman might tweet
24:54
out a picture of my face and like ruin my life and and we didn't have to deal with that when we were in college right
25:00
like there was no Twitter there was no bill Hackman there are these interesting sort of pressure valves and things that
25:05
that lead toward amelioration on the side of the students I think the problem is that politically it's in the interest
25:13
of politicians to stop that from happening they don't want this to go away this is wonderful they want to keep
25:18
the pressure up they want everybody to be all riled up about this issue well the Biden Administration wants it to go
25:24
away they want it to go away yes it's true so part of the reason these the whole situation is a big deal is because
25:31
it divides the liberal upper class against itself if it's just Republicans
25:38
shouting about college students and the college students aren't doing that much I don't think that's a huge problem for
25:45
the Democrats the problem for the Democrats is when the story is the left has turned against Joe Biden and that's
25:52
a problem on both ends it's a problem where the left might actually turn against Joe Biden and he might lose
25:58
votes and it's also a problem because right now Joe Biden needs to convince a bunch of moderate to conservative
26:04
Americans to vote for him instead of trump and the situation isn't helping with that well the primary a primary
26:10
rule of politics is you latch on to any issue that divides your opposition and
26:16
unites your own party and this is a classic one I mean Republicans have no
26:22
split within them over this issue and so they except for except for Tucker Carlson
26:28
and Candace Owens well I mean they have their they have their own anti-Semitism problem so there's a Israel critical if
26:35
you will right but it's I agree it's not it is not especially well represented from an electoral standpoint if Tucker
26:42
decides he wants to run for the presidency we can have this
26:49
discussion all right we're going to leave it there and when we come back we're going to get hot and cold
26:55
[Music]
27:10
[Music] all right guys let's turn to a little distraction before we go who's got
27:16
something for us uh I do so I have just finished watching the Netflix show
27:22
Ripley uh which is an interpretation of a wonderful famous book The Talented Mr
27:28
Ripley and I'm less hot on that show although I think it's certainly watchable it stars The Man known as hot priest uh from flea bag Andrew Scott
27:35
it's a really interesting and in some ways very faithful interpretation of the novel by Patricia heith but what I
27:41
actually want to endorse is just more broadly doing a deep dive on various
27:46
interpretations of a literary character cuz it sent me down this Rabbit Hole I watched you know one of the earliest
27:53
interpretations which is a French film called Purple noon um which which start
27:58
a much much much too handsome and charismatic alen Delon as Ripley uh didn't quite work but anyway the thing
28:04
that I'm endorsing is do a deep dive on some literary character or work that has been interpreted many times over and and
28:10
just think about it I I'm really enjoying that I've watched a couple of those and the Andrew Scott interpretation of the character is not
28:17
resonating with me I don't think he's quite ingratiating enough or kind of appealing enough now it's also beautiful
28:23
it's like done in black and white and it is so gorgeous we talked about the black and white kind of reimaginings with
28:29
Jamal in the last episode and I think it's completely gorgeous but I'm totally with you and there are like potentially
28:35
so many good options out there for digging into Ross do you have a favorite Ripley I love love the Jude Law Matt
28:45
Damon qu PA version but so I have the opposite thing where I'm hesitant to
28:52
watch the new one because I'm like one like obviously I respect black and white but I'm like how can lose the Italian
28:59
color right the the gorgeousness of Italy is so essential to Jude Law on a
29:05
boat the gorgeousness of Jude Law and the blue of Jude Law's eyes I mean I I
29:11
have no no shame in saying that Jude Law is is incredibly gorgeous in the 1999

Talented Mr rley but you get sort of that where you're like my my wife loves
29:22
loves the John Wayne version of True Grit you can't sell her on the cone brother version which is you know I I

29:36
never wants to watch it again but sometimes sometimes it works really well like the Jeremy Brett version of charlock Holmes my household was a big
29:43
on until they did the Benedict cerbat version which we resisted watching for a
29:49
long time but I liked it and it also had Andrew Scott who as Mor arti is to die far right just so y yep well I'm just
