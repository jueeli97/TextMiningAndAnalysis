[Music] so this week is Carlos's turn to be out but in his place we have invited our
0:39
brilliant colleague tresy McMillan cotum tresy is a sociologist and a cultural
0:45
critic and also a columnist here at the New York Times and she has become one of our foremost intellectuals on many
0:50
subjects including the way popular culture shapes politics and vice versa all of which makes her a perfect guest
0:57
for today's episode welcome tressy it's pleasure truly thanks thanks for joining us tressy oh you say that now just wait
1:04
come on in just wait I was trying I was trying to be Sinister you know
1:09
this Dracula greeting Jonathan Harker that was dear L is already tired of us
1:15
got to got to heard these this is going to be a fun one buckle up so the reason that I've gathered you
1:21
all here together to talk is because it is an election year you may have heard uh it is also a year in which two of the
1:28
world's biggest most brilliant shining stars Beyonce and Taylor Swift are
1:33
releasing new albums so this Confluence has me thinking about the role of celebrity in politics do celebrities
1:39
actually have political power can they actually influence our political opinions and our politicians um you know
1:47
some some celebrities have successfully become politicians themselves so even presidents well hold youres we'll get to
1:54
that but before we jump into all that I want to start with a uh a bit of a wager when do you guys think we'll see Beyonce
2:01
and Taylor Swift endorse will they endorse um Last Time Around in 2020
2:06
Taylor waited until October and Beyonce until November um but what do you guys think I'll say around those times I mean
2:12
you want to wait late enough that people are paying attention but you can't wait so late that the early voters have
2:19
already done their thing increasingly that's an issue so I'll I'll go with October October surprise yeah not much
2:25
of a surprise which is why I think October and November too everybody knows who the candidates are these are two
2:30
very known quantities this isn't actually like the last election where there was a little bit more contentiousness um celebrities don't set
2:37
agendas they tend to follow them so with less risk about what the prevailing
2:44
winds are it might be a little earlier but no huge surprise you're not expecting a RFK surprise yeah I was I
2:50
was going to say what about RFK what about RFK he has he has a running mate
2:55
now he should have gone with Taylor I wonder if there's like a four 40% chance
3:01
that Taylor Swift does not endorse this time around I think the very scale of
3:08
her celebrity right now means there's slightly more of a chance that she doesn't want to touch politics this year
3:13
you're just hoping they'll be on their honeymoon by October I'm I no no no no
3:19
but they were I mean they were in Malibu you know just I mean not that I'm following I was say you're watching
3:24
Pretty Closs is a secret I didn't know that I mean look it's not you know it's
3:30
just for the football I'm just in it for the football footb and I actually think it's the exact opposite I think it is
3:35
precisely because Taylor Swiss uh universality has become what it is that she will have to do something nominally
3:42
political that's what modern celebrity has become right is what especially her
3:48
fan base expects of her in a way that Beyonce's fan base does not expect it of
3:53
her especially in an election where race is not very significant among the
3:59
candidates Taylor Swift I actually think will be held responsible for saying something sort of milk toast sure but
4:06
something political about the presidential election in a way well let's let's hold up there for a second because I I'd love to hear you tresy
4:12
talk about their respective fan bases give us a kind of sociologist Bird's eyee view on these two tribes uh and who
4:20
they are and and what they care about and tribes might be the exact right way to think about it they they are fandoms
4:26
but they are also consumer groups and if you you are a politician right now you
4:31
are thirsty for both of those right you want a rabbit devoted emotionally driven
4:37
base of people um and that's why politicians look to celebrities during uh election Seasons this election season
4:45
by the way I would point out is the post dos election I think the midterm elections demonstrated that polling
4:51
continues to sort of echo that and so Beyonce and Taylor swis uh fan base is
4:56
really significant right now they pulling women Beyonce on top of that has a really strong and there's no way to
5:04
even say how strong and devoted her black female and queer fan base is there
5:10
is it's on loock in a way that is hard to describe so yes her fan base is
5:16
multi-racial but she definitely has a more uh sort of a black female queer fan base Taylor Swift is extremely popular
5:23
with white female fans I think especially sort of like aging Millennials and zenial people who came
5:28
of age uh with her um so if you are a politician right now and you are at all
5:35
aware of the fact that angry scared women are shifting the political needle
5:42
you might be thinking that Beyonce and Taylor Swift are uniquely suited celebrity uh endorsements and they're
5:49
obviously going to be much sought after and it's it's probably no surprise where if they do endorse where their endorsements will go well yeah I mean
5:55
don't get me wrong Trump would love he would love the you know well you're talking about
6:02
two obviously huge stars that nobody quite reaches that level but what about
6:08
men do you see anyone who even approaches like a level that matters
6:15
who's out there chesse who oh I do not know men I do not know of the men what
6:20
are the men a woman after my own heart you know do you know the men okay so now
6:25
it's hard to think of a comparable male celebrity we're not even asking them to that good like just is there anyone
6:32
who's even entering the picture guys good news we have a man here he can
6:37
enter them yes um I mean no I you know
6:43
you know the the the coveted the coveted David Beckham endorsement um well I mean
6:50
I think in all seriousness I do think that sort of the biggest male athletes
6:55
in the world have some some vaguely comparable position but not not at all
7:01
in the same way it's interesting right because I think that there are lots of different kinds of celebrities and when you look at the kind of Beyonce Taylor
7:08
Swift level it's very clear but then you have you have other and I think that this is a place where there actually are a lot of very very influential men I
7:15
think about someone like you know the YouTuber Mr Beast or of course Joe Rogan uh the the sort of nastier end of the
7:21
spectrum someone like Andrew Tate um there are men in media who are
7:27
celebrities that don't show up in the way that we think of you know kind of quote unquote celebrity that actually I
7:33
think do have a tremendous amount of influence and yeah I'm just curious about figures like that yeah I so we
7:39
actually call that like micro celebrities and I do think this is the era of micro celebrities so one of the things that's remarkable about Beyonce
7:44
and Taylor Swift is that they are an Uber celebrity in an era of micro celebrities and a micro celebrity being
7:51
someone who is famous with a niche population and the general public can become aware of them in a Flash moment
7:57
and you're like who is this guy all had that moment we're like who are these people every I suddenly talking about
8:03
this person and so some of Taylor S and Beyonce's power is about the fact that they are universally known in this
8:10
moment of micro celebrity but we keep talking about this as if it does matter
8:15
and I did want to stick a pin in that because you know I talked to some political scientists when everybody was kind of going Gaga about you know Taylor
8:23
Swift could swing the election if she could get everybody to register to vote sort of thing and I was like now either
8:29
I have lost my mind or I remember that that's not how it worked well that's one question I had is like what's the
8:36
difference substantively from say Taylor Swift endorsing a particular politician
8:42
versus Taylor Swift just telling everybody it is very important that you vote go register to vote so these yeah
8:49
those are two distinct things and I this is one of the issues I think we have which is we confuse all political
8:55
activity with electoral politics especially during the political season but I think it's just the you know the
9:01
American way so like uh everybody makes a really big deal about this moment
9:06
recently where Taylor Swift made an Instagram post where she encouraged her followers to register to vote and
9:13
something like you know 35,000 new voters were said to have registered um at the nonprofit that she directed them
9:19
to um and we think of that as like electoral politics is certainly a precondition for it but I would argue
9:26
Michelle to your point that's more of a consciousness to use the old feminist term it is bringing some issue into your
9:33
awareness that's not the same as the actual sort of like having the infrastructure to actually get out and
9:40
vote and so it can make it really easy to be slippery with those terms uh it's
9:45
just not quite how it works so like even when we're talking about how much
9:50
celebrities matter they may matter more for like attention than they do for
9:57
anything that we would consider like a electoral politics yeah it's interesting there was a there was a survey in 2019
10:03
by Hill Harris X that said that 65% of respondents said that political endorsements from Hollywood celebrities
10:09
have no bearing on their voting decisions and most surprisingly said that 24% said that celebrity endorsements would make them less likely
10:15
to vote for the celebrity's preferred candidate so I think there is an element of people not wanting to be told what to
10:20
do but you know I think there's also just more broadly I think the sort of difference between politics and issues you know and a way in which celebrities
10:27
I think uh perhaps have and can put issues on the map or
10:33
can pay a really really big price for taking a strong stand on a political issue you know both of which have have
10:39
happened well you look at something like all of the conflict in Sudan over the
10:46
many years you know I long ago I Liv next door to the Sudanese embassy and Al
10:51
Sharpton would come and chain himself to the front door periodically or whatever and then we moved away and I was I was
10:58
always kind of sorry because shortly after that George Clooney got involved and he would go and I'm like well why couldn't George Clooney have been
11:04
shaning himself next door uh so you know you you have celebrities who pick an issue you know Angelina Jolie and the
11:10
global Refugee crisis things like that that do Spotlight issues that most
11:16
Americans and certainly people who are like stargazing at Hollywood stars wouldn't necessarily think otherwise on
11:22
the right you get things like Charlton hon with gun rights over the years uh
11:28
and so I think with issues it's slightly different well thankfully George Clooney solved Sudan because you know nothing
11:34
bad is happening there at the moment so I'm I'm really glad that the en just just as well as Richard Gear freed to
11:40
bet so oh i' forgotten about that yeah oh the Chinese the Chinese government
11:45
has not forgotten yeah they would will not be going yeah I mean I think there's an interesting Dynamic where I think
11:52
both Beyonce and Taylor Swift they create more of a sense among Observers
11:59
that they could have a political impact precisely because they aren't micro celebrities but they have a little bit
12:05
of that kind of micro celebrity identification from their fan base like I was sort of again trying to turn over
12:11
like you know really big male celebrities you know the sort of Tom Cruiser Will Smith at their Peak or
12:16
something like that and none of those guys have at least in my experience
12:22
being a man among among men have that kind of the sense of identification that
12:28
you get get from Hardcore Taylor Swift fans of whom there are several in my house um and hardcore Beyonce fans and I
12:36
think it's like you know Swift and Beyonce seem to have sort of the celebrity of a Tom Cruz but with the
12:42
identification of like you know a Joe Rogan listener or something where you know it did seem to matter for a little
12:49
while that Joe Rogan was you know into Bernie Sanders people were like oh yeah you know it would make sense that the
12:55
Joe Rogan listener could be persuaded to support just by virtue of Rogan's own interest
13:02
and you you you sort of feel that with Swift and Beyonce but you also get this sense that at least I see with swift
13:08
especially where fans really closely identify with the celebrity but if the celebrity does something that the fan
13:15
doesn't immediately sort of like they don't just follow the celebrity they become sort of disappointed with the
13:22
celebrity right it's like when you know Taylor Swift was dating a musician who had said some you know unwoke or
13:28
politically correct things and there was this whole group of Taylor Swift fans who are like doesn't she understand she
13:33
has a responsibility to us yeah I think some of that is because we think that celebrities move their fan base when in
13:41
fact what we know is that no it's the fans that move celebrities totally and
13:47
so that is why it gets really complicated when in the instance of like Taylor Swiss fans being disappointed
13:54
when she's dating a guy who says racist sexist things when she has espoused that the are not her values and she I mean
14:02
they might have broken up for many reasons but it certainly seemed to not be good for her brand anymore to be with
14:07
this guy that's all I'm GNA say I'm not going to over index that because I don't know Taylor personally um but don't
14:13
don't we all know Taylor personally I mean come on don't don't don't sell yourself short right I mean you know you
14:19
know Taylor I don't know Taylor personally however if she'd like to reach out I'm willing to think about a
14:26
relationship you'd have coffee if she if she she seems she seems lovely it's it's
14:31
interesting because I think you're right that celebrities follow rather than lead and it's been interesting to note that
14:37
sort of the big issue right now particularly on the left and among progressives is is Gaza and I think
14:42
Taylor Swift has you know I think she sort of quietly attended one fundraiser for Gaza but has not really made a
14:48
public statement as far as I know I don't think Beyonce has said anything and I think that really does speak to
14:54
the kind of risk aversion you know these are these are giant billion dooll brands
14:59
right and and I think that in some ways like the care that these giant billion dollar brands are taking around what is
15:05
a very very delicate difficult issue in in American domestic politics right now
15:10
is uh you know kind of speaks to your broader point tresy which is that these are fundamentally sort of small C conservative institutions I had an
15:17
identity question for you tresy like speaking to Ross's thing about um fans
15:22
identifying with certain celebrities M this kind of takes me back an age
15:28
bracket at least to the Oprah question like how does Oprah fit into all this I
15:34
mean it's a completely on one hand a completely different kind of celebrity but on the other hand like huge like it
15:40
was hard there for a while to think of anybody bigger than Oprah and she played a she's said to have played a huge role
15:45
in helping Obama get the Democratic nomination in in 2008 yeah so when we're parsing the types of
15:52
celebrities yeah a old school old school and this is getting right hurt about to
15:58
hurt my own feeling Mays as well so I would say Oprah Winfrey is the Pinnacle
16:03
of a 20th century celebrity model that really doesn't exist anymore in that
16:09
Taylor Swift and Beyonce are kind of keeping alive into the 21st century by
16:15
doing a lot of modifications to it so a lot of playing up to that parasocial
16:20
relationship that Ross talks about so they lean into it heav friendship yes these are
16:26
my they give them little names I don't know you're Swifty you're in the Beehive right you've got an official designation
16:34
I don't remember anybody talking about being in the Oprah Hive or you know the
16:39
winrey club right but that's them modifying that 20th century celebrity model for the new 21st century reality
16:47
and I suspect we'll never see this type of uber celebrity again after we sort of cycle through them but yeah Oprah was
16:54
the height of that kind of celebrity didn't quite need the same sort of Paras social caretaking that celebrities need
17:01
to do now she was able to come into your home every day in a way that media just
17:06
can't do anymore and dealing with sort of like once in a generation politicians
17:12
Barack Obama was the first politician she'd ever done that for in all of her celebrity career and I remember her
17:19
talking publicly about deliberating about the risk of doing that Lydia it was very risky even with all of her
17:26
celebrity star power and it's only become riskier in the 21st century when
17:31
people have so many options there's so many ways to get your psychosocial fix and so it's only become more complicated
17:37
I think for these multinational billion dooll celebrity Brands to navigate what
17:44
do my fans want when increasingly fans want
17:57
everything [Music]
18:06
[Music]
18:15
I feel like we've sort of been dancing around this but you know we actually have a genuine certified celebrity who
18:22
is one of the contenders in the current presidential race right y that's right and as as I was thinking about and
18:28
preparing for this episode I was thinking about like you know not just sort of celebrities who dabble in politics as supporters or endorsers and
18:35
things like that but celebrities who have become politicians and obviously we
18:41
are all familiar with one Donald John Trump who was a big celebrity before he came and he takes a lot of these boxes
18:47
that we talked about when we were talking about Taylor Swift or Beyonce I mean it's unclear whether he is actually a billionaire allegedly he is although
18:53
he seems to be having trouble putting his hands on some cash these days liquidity but you know he has a highly
18:59
emotionally engaged fan base right and he also has what seems to be a very
19:06
strong parasocial relationship with his community it's striking to me that the sort of two examples of celebrity
19:12
presidents that we've had have actually both been from the right so you know Donald Ronald Reagan oh not Donald
19:18
Reagan that's a Freudian Donal Donald Reagan Ronald Reagan of course uh being
19:23
the the first example although you know he had two terms as governor of California so at least was prepared in
19:28
some way to ascend to the presidency whereas in the case of Donald Trump it's just pure like you know from The
19:34
Apprentice to the White House to the White House but that struck me as
19:39
interesting because you know we tend to think of and conservatives Grumble about sort of how Hollywood and the celebrity
19:46
complex is just a bunch of liberals so it's interesting to me that the two sort of you know examples that we have of of
19:52
celebrities ascending to the presidency are actually Republicans and Republicans who I think have pulled their party and
19:59
in some ways the country significantly to the right well these things are all connected though right because Republicans are so unhappy with their
20:07
lack of celebrity representation that they are therefore more easily Star Struck by various kinds
20:16
of both New York I mean Trump is a New York celebrity which is a different thing from a Hollywood celebrity but but
20:22
I I do think I I'm not this is not really a joke I I think Republicans are slightly more easily Star Struck by
20:29
celebrities in politics precisely because celebrity is coded as liberal in
20:36
our culture that's exactly right well then you wind up with Fred Thompson in the Senate yeah that didn't work out
20:42
Arnold Schwarzenegger Fred Grandy was in the house off loveboat go through from loveboat well sunny sunny Bono Bon
20:50
cannot forget Sunny Bono yeah can't you I mean there's a lot of people I can't
20:55
forget well Ted nent is like some hug well that's a different thing okay so
21:01
there's no there's different things Donald Trump was a legitimate celebrity legitimately famous are you saying Ted
21:08
Nugent's not legitimately famous Ted nent is is the separate category of not
21:13
so awesome celebrities who Republicans desperately glom on to because they want
21:19
to say oh we've got some celebrity endorsers too two words that's Scott beo that's but that's both interestingly
21:25
both Reagan and Trump in different ways sort of start out as non- Republicans
21:32
right correct and then migrate into the Republican fold change the party in
21:38
various ways not just by making it more conservative I think the CH the changes are more complicated than that but
21:44
that's what you want to do if you're a celebrity if you're a big celebrity who wants to be in politics who doesn't just
21:51
want to send the emails and do the fundraisers you want to get in the game you really should migrate into the
21:57
Republican Coalition that's the opportunity is the soft bigotry of low expectations yes I I it's a hard it's a
22:03
hard bigotry let's not let's not kid ourselves but yeah no that's exactly it the threshold is lower the risk is lower
22:10
uh and the reward is far greater in the Democratic party you are competing with George Clooney a genetically gifted
22:18
human being that is such a good way to put that some of us are competing with George Clooney every day of Our Lives
22:24
Jesse so yeah so the competive a field for celebrity is far thinner more
22:31
shallow on the Republican side and I think Ross is exactly right here I we can't overstate the degree of
22:38
self-consciousness in the Republican Party about celebrity being coded liberal or Progressive uh or Democratic
22:46
so yeah they are much more inclined to accept kind of whatever celebrity they
22:51
can get and then to build the infrastructure to produce their own celebrities this is this other thing I
22:57
think we also see that you know the parallel of conservative media right we've been shut out so we can produce
23:02
our own sort of celebrity and someone as Savvy with the instincts of Donald Trump
23:08
was able to sort of Leverage that in a really I think he deserves credit for this you know however you feel about him
23:14
I think it's dangerous to not give him credit for how well he leverages those impulses within both the Republican
23:22
party and sort of the conservative culture to create official Bonafide
23:27
political celebrity for himself but it really helps that he starts outside cuz the kind of celebrities that are created
23:34
inside the conservative infrastructure they're like hot House Flowers Marjorie Taylor green can win
23:42
house Republican primaries but she's never going to be what Trump is because
23:48
Trump spent part of his career and life speaking to people who are not movement conservatives and that's why he was able
23:53
to bring into the Republican Coalition people who couldn't care less about you know the
23:59
well about Ronald Reagan like there's just a much higher percentage in being
24:04
the the person from outside conservative world who comes in than there is in
24:09
being homegrown I think I I also think that Donald Trump sort of speaks to the way in which what we think of as a
24:15
celebrity is changing I mean we're at a point where arguably Jeff Bezos who's a you know one of the richest men in the
24:21
world is a is a celebrity right like he gets covered on page six and his relationship drama is his f for the
24:28
gossip pages and whatnot you think about someone like Elon Musk these huge technology Titans you know they have
24:34
direct access to huge audiences via social media platforms they have huge
24:39
fan bases in some cases and I think it's also important that Donald Trump became
24:44
a celebrity not through being a movie star although he was uh in Home Alone as
24:50
everyone knows but he was it home alone or Home Alone 2 I always home alone 2one right
24:56
lost in Manhattan that's right but his C is of I think a sort of a newer and the celebrity that vaulted him to the
25:02
presidency via reality television which is a novel format as opposed to having
25:08
you know like Ronald Reagan come through the the old Hollywood studio system I just wanted to raise a question that
25:13
goes back to something that I think tresy you said about beonce and Taylor Swift that they' sort of are trying to
25:18
reinvent celebrity but you said something like you're not sure if there can be anyone's after them right yeah
25:24
cuz I I think this is a question for all of us as Gen X adjacent at least people right is that like the biggest
25:31
celebrities right now including movie stars right like you know Tom Cruz is still a really big movie star all seem
25:38
to have been formed from the older model right before even and even Trump yes reality TV is new as of 2001 but it's
25:46
not a post social media kind of phenomenon so like can you imagine
25:53
celebrity on the scale of either Taylor Swift or Donald Trump mhm being created
26:00
now and and maybe there's a way in which Swift and Company seem so big because they're like they were they got in just
26:06
under the wire right they're like the last the last true celebrities yeah I think of them as Bridges to whatever is
26:13
coming next and I'm going to be honest I'm not sure that what will be coming next will be something better or if I
26:19
want to be optimistic it may not be worse either because there's a lot to be said for again how much we relied on
26:26
Celebrity to create this sort of like mass culture that probably uh helped us
26:31
paper over really meaningful differences in American public life but also what we
26:36
are seeing is like a world of micro celebrities also leads to a type of division and the dissolution of shared
26:43
reality and that's also not good so I mean I think there's some positives and negatives there but I think undoubtedly
26:50
what Ross is saying is exactly true that the biggest celebrities those with sort of like that Global awareness index are
26:58
those that built their initial level of celebrity before social media social media has fragmented what it takes to be
27:05
a celebrity and in fact celebrities might still work with like seleni but
27:11
when you start getting into gen Z they're actually a little resistant to celebrity culture you know to be a fan
27:17
takes a lot of like intense sincerity um and that's kind of cringy uh to very
27:24
young people and so those things are kind of at odds with each other they want a certaine type of authenticity and
27:30
everydayness that celebrity is just not built to give you right celebrity is supposed to be other worldly and so I do
27:37
think we're seeing this reworking of what celebrity is which will be interesting for a political model that
27:43
over the last like I always forget what decade we're in probably you know what 90s like 30 years it's
27:49
204s how Longo is the ' 90s how long that [Music]
27:55
was we don't talk about that politics really assumed a lot of characteristics of celebrity and I think we might be on
28:02
a bit of a crash course here with how celebrity has been reworked and people's rejection of it but for the time being
28:09
we're seeing the people who are of age to vote who are likely voters at that are ones who understand celebrity
28:15
culture have been brought up in it know how it works derive a lot of Psychosocial benefit from it somebody
28:22
like a trump character knows how to manipulate it and use it we don't have anybody on the left that knows how to do
28:28
it nearly as well but on the flip side to Ross's Point there's nobody else on the right who can do it as well as he
28:33
can either well that brings me to my final question for each of you is there an endorsement that you think could move
28:39
the needle in this election assuming that it's Trump and Biden come November can you think of anybody any celebrity
28:45
business leader like someone who's famous doesn't matter what they're famous for that could uh that could
28:51
change the course oh man our producers are going to
28:56
be mad they hate Sil dead air dead air I'm saying no for an endorsement but you know somebody gets a wild hair and puts
29:02
somebody funky on the ticket then we'll talk we talked about Oprah briefly right and if you think that the Oprah
29:08
Winfrey endorsement made a big difference to Obama you can see it as effectively kind of giving a lot of
29:16
democratic voters permission to do something that they already kind of wanted to do I I feel like that was true
29:23
with a bunch of the endorsements for Obama you know getting sort of African
29:28
American leaders other Democratic politicians to sort of say yeah this is
29:33
the guy it's safe to go for him you know he's not going to let you down and then
29:39
what is the equivalent of that at the current moment I it makes me think that like probably it's Trump who stands
29:46
toefit say that you took my point no no then go then go Trump yeah I agree with
29:53
I my thought was it's Donald Trump Trump's endorsing could change the
29:59
election the problem is he's all in on Trump well that's the real that's the I
30:04
wasn't going that far right if I was trying to think of someone who
30:10
was basically giving some people permission yeah to vote for Trump who feel bad about voting for Trump it's a
30:16
different case than Obama but people who feel guilty about voting for Trump and are given permission and you know in
30:22
that sense maybe it's Trump's running mate which isn't really an endorsement but it's like a sort of statement I
30:27
don't know that's why I I you know as you may recall in a prior episode said that picking Nikki Haley as his running
30:33
mate and getting her to accept it would probably be the the the sort of the ultimate endorsement what Biden really
30:38
needs is someone to endorse him at his age Dolly Parton endorsing Biden no
30:45
that's that's no you need let me just say let me just say on the question of his age I don't know if a Dolly Parton
30:51
endorsement could matter but a Dolly Parton figure and there now you do say
30:57
something interesting here Dolly Parton is interesting as a celebrity because
31:02
her universality um is unchallenged in a way
31:08
that Beyonce's and uh Taylor Swifts is not but precisely because she has so
31:14
steadfastly kept herself out of politics that if she were to enter the political
31:20
Fray it would I think for some people signal oh the stakes are so high that
31:25
even Dolly Parton has has had to break her Covenant with herself about being
31:32
political I think it would ruin Dolly Parton for millions of people and I
31:37
can't imagine her ever doing everybody that I've ever talked to around her says it's never going to happen but okay I
31:44
will now maybe amend my vote Lydia I think Dolly Parton could maybe not change the election because again I
31:50
don't think any celebrity could do that but she could change the stakes of the election for some people interesting
31:57
okay well let's leave it there and when we come back we'll get hot and [Music]
