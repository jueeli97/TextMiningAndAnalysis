Is Biden Too Old? America Got Its Answer.



0:00
[Music] sorry my power cord broke um oh same
0:07
thing happened to Joe Biden oh stop stop no save it I've already been I've
0:13
already been using my best stuff save it save it from New York Times opinion
0:19
I'm Michelle coddle I'm Ross DD and I'm isra kin and this is matter of opinion
0:32
all right it is currently 10:55 p.m. on the east coast and we have convened to
0:38
discuss the first and possibly only presidential debate of 2024 for this occasion as you have heard
0:46
we are teaming up with someone whose voice you may recognize columnist and host Ezra Klein welcome Ezra it's good
0:55
to be here on this most cursed of all nights it's so nice to be here with you Ezra here at the end of all
1:02
things no no no you're getting ahead of ourselves so but I do want to get
1:07
started here first give me some quick reactions and keep it non panicked please how are you feeling after
1:14
watching this very special debate Ezra I think the problem is that Donald Trump
1:20
seemed much more presidential than he did in 2020 and Joe Biden seem much
1:26
less months ago I did this piece saying that democrats should consider nominating an alternative candidate at
1:32
the convention uh which is something Ross has also argued uh and is something it mattered it mattered more when you
1:38
said it erra let's be honest create a lot of dissension among among Democrats and the argument was that something like
1:44
this might happen that as much as Democrats feel and I'm I would agree with this that that Joe Biden has been
1:50
making good decisions as president and in that respect seems able to do the job
1:56
that he was no longer able to perform the job very effectively he was skipping the Super Bowl interview he was not
2:02
giving many interviews he had just given the disastrous response to the special counsel report which uh implicated his
2:08
memory he was not seeming up to campaigning for the job uh he then gave a pretty strong State of the Union his
2:13
voice was strong he seemed very energized uh very vibrant but the fear
2:19
that I had had at that time and continued to have in in the uing months was that he has good days and bad days
2:25
in a campaign is long and the debate was a bad day and it is bad to have a bad day on on
2:32
the debate and on the other side Trump who is a very erratic performer himself
2:38
was much stronger than I've seen him in previous debates he was um crispy said a lot of things that were straight
2:44
that were Brazen that were bizarre but he was much more in control
2:50
he was able to stop himself from talking in a way he couldn't in 2020 he was quite clear in most of his answers there
2:57
were exceptions to that for for both of them and I I mean my I was occasionally
3:03
checking in on reaction and and I'm watching Democrats fall into a complete Panic tonight oh yeah before we before
3:09
we get into the ensuing Panic Ross what about you same sort of take I mean Ezra
3:15
Ezra's being very modulated I would say in his entirely
3:21
accurate description of the worst performance for a contender for the
3:26
presidency in a major debate you know since the little known time that Andrew
3:32
Johnson drank too much moonshine at a no I I don't I sorry no I mean this this
3:38
was this you know short of I don't even want to say short of I mean this was
3:45
this was the worst Biden appeared to be as I think we
3:51
should just say he is too old to be running for president of the United States and you know you could say he had
3:58
he has a cold I think that was put out um listeners can hear that I myself have
4:05
a cold at the moment um I've had one for a little while it's a bad cold I'm also running on very little sleep I have a
4:12
newborn child and I'm pretty sure that I am more equipped to be president of the
4:18
United States than Joe Biden based on that performance I I mean I I honestly
4:24
think like we can sort of dig into the back and forth of the debate and I agree
4:30
with Ezra that Trump was by his standards quite strong in certain ways
4:35
um some of his answers being you know this being Donald Trump were you know ridiculous nonsense wild exaggeration
4:42
and so on I think you could say he he did you know he he did his job in terms of
4:47
Prosecuting the case against Biden saying you know the world is less safe
4:53
than when I was in charge the border is less secure and inflation was low when I left and now it's high I mean that you
5:00
know that's that's his argument he made it but but really the Trump part of the
5:06
equation is just not the important part here the important part of the equation is is Joe Biden still going to be the
5:13
Democratic nominee and if he is the Democratic party is derelict in its duty
5:19
to the United States of America I I think that's the only takeaway okay we're definitely going to get to those
5:24
questions but I mean I would like I would like to disagree
5:30
or be the kind of ray of sunshine in this discussion but I can't I I I've
5:38
tried I've sat here I'm like what can I say that's going to put a positive spin on this so I I do think that you know
5:45
ordinarily I feel a little bit bad when I come out of these debates because I I
5:50
listen to the policy discussions or I listen to kind of the substance and then I'm like well people aren't looking for
5:56
that largely they're looking for how the candidates sound and you know how
6:02
they're looking and how they're in this case I am betting that America had a
6:08
hard time following any of the substance in this debate it was all about what was
6:14
a truly hot mess of a performance by the president of the United States and I'm
6:21
just not sure that anything they said in terms of policy or substance matters
6:28
well well let me try to pull out what I think went very arai in in Biden's argument on substance because I
6:34
don't think the problems for Biden were purely stylistic so I think if you extract
6:40
going back to the beginning of the debate what Biden was actually saying he he begins by trying to puncture the bubble of nostalgia for Trump by saying
6:48
look you you all are forgetting what a disaster this country was When Donald Trump left the scene we were in the
6:55
throws of Co there was a crazy level of defit spending unemployment was really
7:01
high the economy was frozen but Trump's attack on Biden is that things are bad
7:07
now that inflation is high now that people are mad about prices now that the world feels out of control now and in
7:15
response to that and and this is something I found very striking Biden fell back in an almost second term
7:22
clintonian way on very specific policies he has passed as opposed to any Grand
7:28
Narrative of what he has done so he kept hearing you know bring up Medicare drug pricing which is a something they passed
7:35
as a very small part of the inflation reduction act there were things he brought up but you know if you think
7:41
about the big Narrative of Joe Biden's legislation right the inflation reduction act the big climate Investments there the bipartisan
7:47
infrastructure Bill the chips and science act it's a narrative about industrial policy a narrative about Innovation a narrative about spending
7:54
money building real things in the real world well Donald Trump had very few accomplishments like that you know was a
7:59
joke that he kept saying was infrastructure week and ever passing an infrastructure Bill Biden was very caught up in details and did not have I
8:06
think a strong Grand narrative except for saying that the economy is doing well by International comparisons which
8:12
is true but people you know don't feel it they they they feel very upset about the economy and and so there actually I
8:18
think was a substance problem I don't think Biden while he couldn't land rhetorically his punches I also don't
8:24
think his overall presentation was strong and the truth TR is that I think
8:30
that Trump had some strong points in his a lot of what Trump said about his own presidency I think was uh factually
8:37
incorrect but the general sense that that that he pushed which is like you know if you go back things felt calmer
8:43
to you than they do now it was clear he was able to deliver it repeatedly and the fact that yeah there is a I mean
8:49
Russia did invade Ukraine I don't think it's Joe Biden's fault like there is a disaster happening in Gaza right now his
8:55
ability to Coast off of a generalized sense of disorder was to me his sort of strongest argument throughout the night
9:01
yeah I mean Trump was much better than we have seen him in many opportunities
9:07
and I love your take I I I just love the idea that the the biggest problem here
9:13
with Biden's defense of his record was that it was kind of small boore as
9:19
opposed to Big message except that even with the small boore he couldn't do a
9:24
straight line narrative at one point early on he wound up saying something
9:30
along the lines of I took down Medicare what I mean this was just
9:37
beyond and so look I was listening for the substance I was listening for him to
9:43
make his case because I think he's been a very effective president he has very
9:49
impressive achievements he's managed to get through stuff that by all accounts he should not have been able to get
9:55
through he had a lot to brag about and he just couldn't do
10:01
it yeah I I mean I yeah I'm I'm I'm hesitant again
10:07
to even sort of do normal debate analysis I would indorse most of what
10:13
you said Ezra I yeah I think Trump trump had clear lines of attack against Biden
10:20
based on big things that have happened since Biden took office that people don't like and you know in his trumpian
10:28
way he prosecuted those arguments pretty effectively Biden I mean I I think that
10:35
there's a real disconnect between the sort of pro Biden arguments about how
10:42
many bills he's passed and how the American public actually views his
10:47
presidency right so I I think it's hard for Biden to come out and brag about specific pieces of legislation if Trump
10:55
can just counter and say Americans care way more about the inflation rate than
11:00
your long-term investments in science and technology right like Biden H would have had to do more than that and the
11:08
more that he would have had to do would have been essentially a stronger
11:13
prosecution of the case against Trump around January 6th a stronger
11:19
prosecution of his arguments on foreign policy that however bad the world is right now Trump might make it worse but
11:27
again like to me the Central thing about this debate like you watch the debate
11:32
with the sound off right the split screen moments where when Biden is
11:38
talking Trump is Trump you know he's making his faces he's sort of glowering and he's jowly and you know and sort of
11:45
smirking here and there like but you know he he looks like a guy who is you
11:50
know comfortable being on television right when Trump is talking Biden's face
11:56
hung slack in a way that I I just again
12:01
I I I I think the Optics of it alone before you even get into the mumbling
12:08
and fumbling and missteps and stumbling the Optics alone are so devastating as
12:13
to render the discussion of you know what what kind of argument they should have been having almost
12:19
irrelevant I I do think that the single most damaging way to think about tonight
12:25
is to to imagine that people are asking themselves do I want a Joe Biden who is three years or four
12:33
years older than Joe Biden is now serving as
12:39
president I I said back in the day when I was doing these pieces uh you know before the State of the Union that look
12:46
like he can he can do the job of the presidency but he can't perform it I I've always thought like that that line
12:52
is a little fuzzier than I gave it credit for then because the presidency isn't just about making decisions
12:59
it is also about communicating those decisions and it is also about persuading people that what you're doing
13:05
is the right thing right very famously the the power of the presidency is a power to persuade right that is like the classic political science view of the
13:13
president for Biden's communication capabilities to deteriorate as they have
13:19
and this idea that he is a cold tonight we've all seen Joe Biden appear like this before many times his answers were
13:25
cogent um this is not a guy who's scile but this is not a guy who I think most
13:31
people would look at up on the stage and say I am confident that three years from
13:38
now he should be getting woken up in the middle of the night to handle International crises that I am confident
13:45
that two years from now if you put him in a room with a bunch of wavering
13:50
moderate Democrats or possibly getable Republicans that he's going to be the
13:55
guy who can make the argument to win them over and so on that that visceral level that
14:02
you know would you hire this guy for the job or the other guy for the job to me that was the disaster of the night for
14:08
for Joe Biden he did not look up to the [Music] job let's take a quick break and we'll
14:15
be right back [Music]
14:29
at 10 minutes in people had stopped listening to the details I mean my phone was blowing up with people
14:38
panicking we're not going to sit here and and talk about whether he's scile or you know kind of the definition of
14:43
cogent his answers weren't weren't comprehensible they were not much less
14:49
clear during a lot of this and so when Trump would fire off an accusation about
14:57
you being the worst president or you're going to run this country into a ditch after a certain point people weren't
15:03
listening to kind of what it was that Trump was accusing him of doing running the country into the ditch they're just
15:10
like yeah this guy can't do this he he can't keep the country on track and it
15:16
absolutely pains me to say this but that's all people are going to take away
15:21
from this is is that he is not up to the job well and and I mean to link or
15:28
attempt to link the substance of the debate such as it was to the nature of Biden's performance
15:34
a lot of Trump's argument on foreign policy especially was based on the idea
15:40
that the world was more stable when he was president because other countries
15:45
were a little bit afraid of him that they thought he was kind of a tough guy they didn't know what what he was going
15:51
to do he was willing to take out Soloman and so on right I mean that that that kind of argument and if you're watching
15:58
the debate that argument seemed to be Vindicated right there on the stage you watch that debate and you're like yeah the guy on
16:04
the left whatever his other problems seems like a guy who would be more intimidating to the leaders of Iran
16:11
Hamas and even his pal Vladimir Putin than the guy on the right like that that
16:18
that was just a winning argument for Trump right there yeah I I do just want to tour for a minute on some things
16:24
Donald Trump actually said because I think the the one thing I I don't exactly want to say is that the only thing that was happening up there was
16:32
Joe Biden was turning in a poor performance because I I thought that it
16:38
was interesting the way Trump portrayed things so some of it was just like
16:44
infuriatingly uh wrong um so for instance at one point he's like before covid we were having amazing numbers on
16:51
addiction right like nobody had ever seen these numbers before nobody had seen those numbers before in the sense that they were at that point a uh record
16:58
high for drug overdose deaths and it kept going up postco but you know there
17:03
are a lot of things Donald Trump just said in his kind of Donald trumpian way they were just completely in in outer
17:10
space um you know when he said that everybody wanted abortion sent back to the States everybody liberal
17:17
conservative well the smart I kept waiting for him to say that Joe Biden wanted it right because Joe that I was
17:23
that was what I was expecting because in fact Joe Biden was moderately pro-life Once Upon a Time was a period when Joe
17:29
Biden when Joe Biden made this argument look he was lying like a dog so he was lying constantly the the T it was really
17:37
frustrating to me I just did a whole podcast about Trump's tariffs and deportation proposals I mean Trump at
17:42
this time of high inflation has an agenda that would unambiguously send
17:47
prices skyrocketing right you're going to tap a 10 you're going to attach a 10% tax to any material of any kind imported
17:55
from anywhere add a 60% one to anything from China that'll D prices up Mass deportation would drive prices up right
18:02
you know uh there there was so much there I mean Trump really did play this one on Vibes right like the the the
18:09
border is a disaster inflation is a disaster the world is disordered
18:15
and there was no I mean Biden was not capable of peeling apart what Trump is
18:21
actually proposing or or doing which again to me is a real problem I mean democrats should not be trying to make
18:26
this election easy for Donald Trump by giving him somebody who makes him look young in comparison and can't prosecute
18:31
the case but it's also I think just worth saying that yeah like Trump's like
18:37
uh portrayal of his own approach to things was often just totally bizarre
18:44
look he is he is pathologically dishonest and it became pretty clear
18:51
very early on that he realized that Biden was not in a position to counter
18:56
anything he was going to say so his exaggerations his lies his misstatements
19:02
his spin just got worse and worse and worse throughout the debate it's just
19:07
Biden was unable to kind of muster a
19:12
straightforward push back I mean he kept saying over and over again the idea the
19:18
idea I mean that was every response was the idea yes we we understand the idea
19:25
is shocking and absurd and that is why you need to come back at it but that was
19:30
off the table it's but it's not I mean frustration is one emotion that one
19:35
could feel but you know I mean we've we've had a lot of conversations over the last eight years about the ways in
19:41
which Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency and you know some of the
19:48
dishonesty on display tonight it's not not the most extreme example of that but you know I'm happy to continue to
19:55
acknowledge that Donald Trump is unfit for the presidency but Joe Biden is unfit for the presidency as well and
20:01
that is Manifest in tonight's performance he is unfit to be president
20:07
of the United States it is so where does that leave this race what do you you
20:12
guys have both put forth the argument that he should not be the nominee where
20:19
are you where are you wanting to take it now guys either one of you what what is
20:24
the big idea I think Ezra's got a plan Ezra tell the plan always has a plan I
20:31
don't know that I would call this a plan at this point look I I often try to get people to imagine this in this way
20:37
because I think for the Democrats they have a kind of it's like an event horizon they can't think past of how
20:44
would you get Joe Biden out of the race what would happen but if Joe Biden God forbid had some health crisis that made
20:52
it so he could not run Democrats would not just curl up into the fetal position and hand the
20:58
election to Donald Trump they would do what the rules say they need to do which is they would go to the convention
21:05
between the moment that happened and the moment of the convention that people who imagin themselves as plausible
21:11
Democratic nominees for president would give speeches and go on CNN and do town halls and you know say things on on
21:19
social media and go talk to state democratic delegations and try to do the kind of convention campaigning that was
21:27
how nominated were won for most of American History till the late 60s and and early'
21:32
70s and then they would try to pick a ticket that they thought could win maybe
21:39
that would be Gretchen Whitmer and Josh Shapiro maybe that would be Wes Moore and Gavin Newsome they they have the
21:45
issue that even though I don't think kamla Harris is a strong candidate I said back then and I believe tonight was
21:52
proofing this that I think she's probably a little underrated I would have much preferred to have Harris up on that stage tonight than Joe Biden but
21:58
because they don't believe Harris is a strong candidate because they can't see a way around nominating her that they
22:04
don't think would fracture the party but there is nothing conceptually impossible about going to a convention you have
22:10
months which is like how this used to happen you have I think a fair amount of
22:15
democratic Talent you could you know try to have waiting in the wings it is not a safe route it is risky it could blow up
22:22
in everybody's face but at this point the Joe Biden plan is blowing up in everybody's face right I think you are
22:28
very close to a situation which is you can lose with Joe Biden or maybe lose
22:34
with someone else but if the fate of American democracy is hinging on this
22:41
election as Democrats are always telling me it is and as I think there is a chance that it is then you should do
22:47
everything you can to win it not doing anything from here because it's uncomfortable and maybe doing something
22:54
else might not work either I I don't really know what to say about it like walking into this in Nate Silver's
22:59
election model Trump had a two3 shot at winning the electoral college right that was what the model said yesterday I
23:06
don't think it gets better from here what it's going to be the convention speech it is going to resuscitate Joe Biden it's going to be some other
23:12
conviction for Donald Trump it's going to be the second debate does anybody believe they're really going to have that I I don't at some point Democrats
23:19
have to decide if they want to try to win this election or it is simply too uncomfortable for them to do anything
23:26
but be on this train as it derails but right now it feels to me like the train is derailing and like one last thing and
23:32
I know I'm renting a bit but it's been it's been bothering me the the voters have been telling Democrats this whole
23:37
time that Joe Biden is too old it has been true in every single poll anybody has run at any time and Democrats keep
23:43
telling the voters they're wrong and you just can't do this when they can see it you can't do it when it's visible In
23:50
fairness Democratic voters did have a chance to vote for Dean Phillips right I
23:56
mean you know over over Biden I mean I mean he gets he gets
24:02
the nomination now right isn't that those are the rules you're enjoying this way too much you know what I am actually
24:08
not enjoying this no I am I mean I am enjo I mean you you have to look look I
24:15
have spent the Trump era arguing with people who take the situation with
24:22
Donald Trump as president extremely seriously and suggesting that you need
24:27
to see the absurdest side of it and so in this situation too I think it is
24:32
important to see the absurdest side of the spectacle right down to what we
24:38
haven't even talked about the Great Golf Handicap debate that closed out this debate for the ages I refuse to talk
24:44
about the golf handicap debate oh my God no but guys so that's all amazing but look Ezra just made a really strong
24:51
pragmatic case right for how the Democrats need to you know try to win
24:57
this election can't let Trump get in Biden's going to lose if he goes on like this he's going
25:03
to lose but there's also just the same kind of case that was made against
25:08
Republicans who went along with Trump should be made against Democrats who go along with Biden now Biden is a
25:14
different kind of danger to the US than the instability of trump but it is a dangerous thing for the United States of
25:21
America to consider reelecting the man we saw on stage to the presidency at an
25:26
extremely dangerous moment in world history it is morally bankrupt for the Democratic party to go forward with this
25:33
man as president and that has to be said as well but it's also but it's also funny it's also a little
25:45
funny let's take a quick break here and we'll be right back [Music]
25:57
[Music] so I have been excruciatingly aware and
26:04
had many discussions about all of the kind of logistical challenges that people have talked about like when you
26:10
push out an incumbent president you are just asking for a world of hurt but that
26:17
said at this point the party really is overdue for a good gut check as to what
26:24
they think is going to happen and I think there are a lot of senior Biden people who need to be asking themselves
26:32
like what on Earth are we expecting to happen to turn this around and I just
26:38
can't come up with a good scenario so Ezra we're gonna we're g to go with your
26:43
plan right the problem I think the Democratic party has is couple fold one
26:49
is just simply a collective action problem and this was also the the thing that was a an issue around the primaries
26:57
as Ross said or suggested the the only real Democrats who ran against Biden were Dean Phillips and then in a
27:03
different way uh RFK Jr and I think that might have been different if Democrats had suffered the
27:10
wipeout in 2022 that many people expected they would but they didn't they
27:15
had a stronger than expected midterm that strengthened Joe Biden's hand and it's very dangerous if you're Gavin Nome
27:22
if you are Jared pus if you're Gretchen Whitmer if you're JB pritsker if you're
27:27
one of the the the national level Democrats you know Ro Chris Murphy Etc
27:33
Amy kachar to challenge the incumbent president so you know so you see people doing things like what Gavin Newsome is
27:38
doing which is running this weird quasi presidential campaign like as a Joe Biden surrogate to like make himself
27:45
stronger for 2028 or look like a strong alternative if something happens and Biden has to drop out they still have
27:52
this Collective action problem now you know if you're staff around Joe Biden um you know what
27:58
you're going to go to Joe Biden and tell him he's got to drop out I think you should I said that before that the only
28:04
way Joe Biden drops out is if the people he trusts most kind of collectively convince him to do so and this goes I
28:09
think a little bit to something Ross was saying there's this argument about Biden and I think it has been in many ways a
28:15
true argument about Biden he's a a patriot he's a very decent man he cares a lot about the country he's been in
28:20
public service his whole life I do think at some point that that demands he looks at this situation with a little bit more
28:30
self-awareness and realism than he has I mean it was his decision to run again
28:35
and he shouldn't have made it does he want to be Ruth Bader Ginsburg right who
28:41
did amazing things for the country did amazing things for for for liberalism but wiped out that Legacy and more by
28:49
refusing to retire while Democrats still had the Senate uh and people saw that
28:54
coming I was one of many people who wrote a piece saying Ruth Bader Ginsburg should should retire and she didn't and the cost of that
29:00
arguably was row and Joe Biden too might end up in the same position like if
29:06
Trump is as dangerous as he says he is then Biden has to help the party figure out how to beat him and if that's not
29:11
through him then you help them figure out and you clear the way for whom it is if you think kamla Harris cannot win
29:19
then you try to talk to her about that right then like I wouldn't want to do that conversation either if I was but if
29:25
that is what they believe right if the thing a lot of people think about them is that they can't imagine doing anything because they're trapped by
29:31
their belief that Harris isn't strong enough well then they're the one who picked her it's on them to figure something out like is this important or
29:37
is it not like that to me is like the thing that keeps coming up like is is it actually okay if Donald Trump wins if it
29:44
is fine but if it's not then what then you got to do something it's not just about Trump here
29:53
right like Ruth Bader Ginsburg staying on the court had Trump not won or had she you know not passed when she did and
30:00
had she become incapable of being a Supreme Court Justice her clerks would have written her opinions for her and
30:08
wouldn't have been ideal but it wouldn't have been the end of the world Joe Biden you know I mean again
30:15
we've had this conversation about Trump so many times Joe Biden is in charge of America's like nuclear weapons Joe Biden
30:23
is in charge of the Pax Americana at its greatest moment of strain in Generations Joe Biden is in charge of
30:32
you know the United States of America at a moment when a bunch of you know kooky but quite smart people think we're about
30:38
to take some kind of Quantum Leap in terms of what artificial intelligence is going to do right like I'm sorry if the
30:46
choice is between the two men you saw on stage tonight are you choosing Biden for
30:52
that guys between the two of them yes I would choose Biden for that absolutely I mean for two reason one is that the
30:59
thing you just said about Ginsburg is also true for presidents I don't think Biden is seile and I think in general he's been making good decisions but they
31:05
are surrounded by staff and they are surrounded by agencies and who you nominate to positions matters so one
31:11
absolutely I've watched how Joe Biden is governed in the past couple of years I saw how Donald Trump has governed I also see what Donald Trump is proposing I see
31:18
what Joe Biden is proposing I mean Trump's 10% tariff on everything plan is
31:23
genuine lunacy no no but wait wait a minute don't Jo Donald Trump's 10%
31:30
tariff on everything plann is a bad idea having the Joe Biden we saw on stage two
31:38
years further on in the midst of a major world crisis seems to me objectively
31:46
more dangerous than having look so far in my view Biden has not dramatically mishandled or even really mishandled at
31:52
all a major crisis I mean I have my disagreements with him on Israel policy I've been in a ol ologist for the Biden
31:59
foreign policy I I I think he did the right thing getting out of Afghanistan as badly as it went I you know in I just
32:07
interviewed JD Vance recently and tried to make the case to him that Biden's Ukraine policy has been actually pretty
32:14
restrained and reasonable I can make the same case that you're making but there
32:19
is a role that the presidency plays in the world system that depends on the guy
32:24
being there and I I just think I think we're in danger of understating the extent of the
32:29
limitations that we saw in from Joe Biden tonight that's all and what it implies for again the sort of the
32:38
morality of putting him back in charge independent of the question of like how do you beat Trump so you're worried that
32:45
Vladimir Putin watches tonight's debate and is like oh yeah I can just steamroll
32:51
him I mean aren't you worried about that International politics is in a fist fight like I I really think this is sort
32:56
of getting a little bit bit too into the pomp of a debate they're not like the
33:02
way you do International politics is not Putin and and Joe Biden go in a back room and you know like have a like a
33:08
bare chested wrestling match as much as Putin might might enjoy politics working out that way it's not that but it's not
33:14
it's not not that completely I think it is not not that but I or whichever number of negatives I need but but I
33:21
look I if you're asking me who on the debate I would choose to be president you're asking me as Joe Biden says to
33:27
not comp comp him to the almighty but to the alternative my view is that democrats should not make this that easy
33:34
I don't think Joe Biden should be running like I'm very clear on that look the place where Democrats are paralyzed
33:40
in my view is strategically right they don't they're they they can't and I got a lot of feedback on this much of it
33:46
very angry I talked to people who are involved in conventions I talked to the kinds of people who are delegates of conventions or who would be influential
33:52
to delegates at conventions they don't believe the party has a muscle for this they're not sure who the delegates are it's not like it was in the 60s where
33:59
parties knew how to do this and had like a lot of um muscle memory on it and so I
34:05
think you know if if tomorrow what is going to happen or today is that people are going to wake up in the Democratic
34:11
party and think oh no we have to do something the problem they're facing
34:16
really is is what do they do and so I'll ask it of you two I mean do the two of
34:22
you actually think if you're the Democratic party you go to a convention and you just sort of open open this up
34:28
on the floor and try your best or do you try to coronate kamla haris like what are you actually saying should happen i'
34:34
I've ranted I'll let Michelle handle that one I think that they they should have a plan in place before they get to the convention I mean they if they if
34:41
they wanted to go down this road they need to do a lot of leg work and a lot
34:46
of organization before you get it to the convention and just throw it open I think that's not how it works anymore I
34:53
think you would have to have made some deal and agreements I mean the party has
35:00
a good farm team but I don't think you can just like leave it to God on
35:05
convention week I think that of course if you know if you're running the
35:11
convention if you're running the DNC you obviously want to have some kind of plan
35:16
but like the worst case scenario for say Biden does his duty I think it is his
35:23
duty and stands aside if he stands aside and endorses Harris then it's just going
35:30
to be Harris right say he stands aside and doesn't endorse Harris say you go to the convention and it's like the worst
35:36
case scenario and it's you know it's chaos and and so on right still the the
35:41
end point there is one of two things happen either Harris emerges as the nominee which still probably the most
35:48
likely scenario or one of the Josh Shapiro Gavin Nome Gretchen Whitmer
35:55
group somehow catches is fire through some uncertain process and they become the nominee neither of those are like
36:02
the apocalypse for for the Democrats right like nobody likes the unknown but
36:07
it's not like Dean Phillips is going to walk out of the Convention as the nominee it's either going to be there
36:12
somebody that you would feel comfortable with Ross I mean obviously you me well I'm and Ezra I mean first again I would
36:20
feel more comfortable after tonight with k Harris than with Joe Biden and is that
36:26
who you would feel most most comfortable with I mean I don't you know I think Josh Shapiro is a fairly impressive guy
36:33
among the Democrats I mean if you're asking me to just like randomly pick the Democratic nominee sure Josh Shapiro how
36:41
about that I don't I don't yeah what about you Ezra I I think you actually have a I did a great I think great
36:46
episode with LA kmar on how conventions work and and I think that you have to go through a process of seeing these people
36:51
under this kind of light uh there's a good interview from our friends over at the interview podcast with Gretchen Whitmer uh that came out about a week
36:58
ago you can find it on the daily feed or on the interview feed and I thought she performed well there but I think you
37:04
need to see people pushed right which again if they did something in the next
37:09
week right if Joe Biden comes out and says look like this is a very hard moment for me but I've come to the
37:16
conclusion that I'm a liability to something bigger than me if I run again
37:21
and I have great faith in the Democratic party I have great faith in the many amazing people who have served in my
37:26
Administration kamla Harris Pete Buddha jedge um so on
37:32
and I'm going to finish out my term and do the best I can on the crisis I'm facing and you know the the Democratic
37:39
part is going to pick a new candidate I think we would see right and I think that it would be up to people to to give speeches and you know we could see if
37:45
you know Gina Rondo the the Commerce Secretary and former Rhode Island Governor is able to to to catch fire I I
37:52
do before we we go too far down this path though I want to at least take a minute and and push the the
37:58
Biden apologist line here and and and see what you think of it so if I'm if
38:05
you say that he had a cold I'm gonna scream if I'm a die hard Biden guy here's here's what I would say this was
38:12
a bad night if you go back to 2012 Barack Obama in the flower of of middle
38:19
age has a quite bad first debate against M Romney I mean it's like an actual disaster for Democrats they're
38:24
completely freaking out Chris Matthews famously gives us like total panicked response right after on
38:30
MSNBC and that it's often the case that presidents who are not used to being challenged anymore and are not debating
38:36
and have no seals for this have a hard time on their first outing and yes this is what it looks like when an
38:43
81-year-old has that performance this is not who he is this is not the guy we see
38:48
in private it's not the guy you saw at the State of the Union it's not the guy you see in a lot of the speeches and he just got kind of Knocked
38:56
back but you know he is is the incumbent the economy is improving he's going to get better this is going to knock some
39:03
clarity into him I guess and you know in the same way that people didn't
39:09
completely lose their marbles after you know Obama had a bad debate and fell behind Romney in the polls they shouldn't do that with with Joe Biden
39:15
now that all this debate stuff is as people always would say at me Aeron cirin fanfiction and that like you know
39:23
the party's got Biden they've got to figure out what to do with him and that you know he can still will have a big
39:28
comeback at the second debate which we're definitely going to have uh because you know cuz Trump's going to be
39:33
up for that one I think I think Trump 100% will be up for that one actually but well I would say 100% I think he
39:39
might that's the v in apologist line I could imagine your best your best start believing in Aaron sorc and fanfic ly
39:47
cuz you're living in it sorry oh that got weird fast sorry the meme the meme
39:54
had to come out I totally take your point Ezra when everybody freaked out over Obama in the bad performance back
40:00
then I was like H that's just like that's a bit much the problem as I see it this time is that this so fits The
40:08
Narrative of Joe Biden is too old and unfit I mean the best joke I saw going
40:14
into this debate was that it was a wellness check for both of these guys and I do not think the test results came
40:21
back glowing the attack is always bad or the misstep is always bad when it fits
40:28
with what people are inclined to believe anyway it's what makes me think this one will have more legs than usual I mean
40:36
but Obama lost a debate to Romney like on points right that was just not what
40:42
we watched here I I mean I agree again with Ezra that that Biden also lost this
40:48
debate on points like to the extent that you scored the debate Trump won on points but that's not what we're talking
40:55
about here we're not talking about how you know Trump landed some punches and
41:00
Biden you know Biden didn't didn't exactly have a great response we're talking I mean if you really wanted to
41:07
push it you could say you know it's Ronald Reagan in the first debate with Walter Mondale right where Reagan seemed
41:13
a little more out of it than than Obama did right like I mean if you really if
41:19
you want to stretch things but um yeah I mean he's Joe Biden is too old
41:26
to be president my last kind of thought is do you really think any of this is going to happen
41:32
like I tend to think we can talk about this all night long ain't nothing big
41:37
gonna shift like the Biden people are not gonna they're going to come out they're going to say everybody's being
41:44
too hysterical these things don't matter he's up for the job blah blah blah
41:50
whatever I think the Democrats are the party of the media and the intelligencia
41:56
it's pretty hard for a Democratic president to Soldier on when he loses the media and the
42:04
intelligencia no matter what his loyal staffers say and my impression it's 11:42 p.m. I'm just you know watching TV
42:12
and reading social media like the rest of you but my impression is that tonight Biden lost a really important part of
42:19
his base which is people who cover politics for a living um Esra give us
42:26
some uplift oop sorry that's not no but wait this is I I know we have to end but if you want to be uplifted as a Democrat
42:33
isn't that couldn't that be the good news right there are going to be conservatives tonight who are saying
42:39
Trump did too well because he's going to knock Biden out of the race and the
42:45
Democrats will nominate someone who can beat him I don't make predictions I'm not going to play it as uplifter or uh
42:51
pessimism the Democratic part is is going through as we speak a genuine Panic they were quite unnerved as of
42:59
last week they're going to be in crisis this week and we're going to see now if
43:04
the Democratic party can act like a party right is that that structure which
43:10
sometimes now seems vestigial like like you have the organization of something that looks like a party but to use the
43:15
term from Sam Rosenfeld and and Daniel schlotman that it's a hollow party that there's nothing in the center of it or
43:22
can it act right I mean you go back to the 2020 primaries Biden is not looking looking great um it looks like Sanders
43:29
is going to win and there's all at once after South Carolina this convergence through kachar and and budded endorsing
43:36
him this sort of movement of the party that makes a that sends a very strong signal and and helps Biden uh take the
43:42
nomination when he was looking quite on the ropes like very shortly before that it's easy to forget how bad he looked
43:47
after Iowa New Hampshire and so now we're going to see right the Democratic party I don't believe I don't believe if
43:54
you you gave all the you know top Democrats right now truth serum or such
43:59
a thing there and you said is Biden going to win they would tell you yes so now that that is like sitting there in
44:05
their hearts we will see can they act in any kind of coordinated way to do
44:11
something difficult which is persuade this guy that he shouldn't run again and risk becoming the Ruth Bader Ginsburg of
44:17
this election and destroying his legacy and handing this back to Donald Trump or
44:23
can they can they get him to stand aside and if they do can they use the party and the convention the way
44:29
these things were traditionally done to try to choose a ticket strategically if they don't believe it's KLA Harris then
44:36
that is a politically tricky but not the end of the world thing to have to to handle um by the way in
44:44
2016 the vice president did not get the nomination right I mean somebody else got the nomination because the party
44:49
strategically organized around Hillary Clinton not Joe Biden that was probably a strategic mistake back then but
44:55
nevertheless like some sometimes the vice president does not get the the nomination if they don't believe it's her because she's not able to impress
45:02
people in a kind of runup period then so be it and maybe she would impress everybody in a runup period I do think she's somewhat underrated uh but you
45:10
know we're going to see like is a is a Democratic party a party or is it just Joe Biden just whoever is in charge at
45:16
that moment okay well I'm gonna go put on my pajamas and we're going to call it
45:21
