What J.D. Vanceâ€™s Transformation Tells Us About the Future of Democracy


0:00
Ross is hot on having more kids not not more we have just we have just enough
0:07
just the correct number you have fielded your own basketball team my friend that's right it's quite an
0:14
accomplishment from New York Times opinion I'm Lydia pen I'm Michelle coddle I'm Ross D I'm Carlos Lozada and
0:21
this is matter of opinion
0:30
okay guys today I want to tackle a theme that I see shaping elections around the world this year and most notably in the
0:36
west and that is a growing support for populism we've seen its influence in messages about the economy and
0:42
immigration which have really become defining issues in our us election those issues and how to address them are also
0:49
playing a big role in upcoming elections in two of the most important countries in Europe the UK and with a surprising
0:55
last minute twist an election in France so we're going to spend this episode digging into why populism appeals to so
1:01
many in this moment we're going to start in Europe and then we're going to look at the us and we're very lucky that
1:09
matter of opinions very own Ross is back from parental leave and we couldn't talk about this
1:15
subject without him because I know it's one that's very close to his heart and that he follows very closely um so Ross
1:21
I'm hoping that you can explain to us how populism has been shaking up politics in Europe recently um hopefully
1:28
keep it pretty high level and simple for for those falling along at home yeah for me remember who I first it's it's great
1:34
to be back um my understanding is that you guys have gotten away with a lot of stuff in my absence made made a lot of
1:42
points that perhaps needed to be rebutted and weren't so I'm I'm back those good times are over and I'm very
1:49
happy to talk about populism in Europe but the important thing to say is that nobody completely understands what's
1:57
happening in French politics right now uh but basically Emanuel macron the
2:03
president in the aftermath of Elections to the European Parliament in which
2:09
populist parties did quite well he decided to call a snap election for
2:16
basically the French legislature and what makes this decision very strange is
2:22
that macron's own party the sort of cobbled together Centrist party that macron himself invented is extremely
2:29
unpopular and it's unusual to call a snap election when you are extremely unpopular right
2:37
and what everyone sort of expected to happen seems to be roughly what's happening which is that the populist
2:44
right has Consolidated a lot of support and a coalition of left and far-left
2:51
parties have Consolidated a lot of support so you could say in effect you have two forms of populism pitted
2:58
against a deeply unpopular Center and it's not at all
3:04
clear why mcon did this right um and the two working theories are on the one hand
3:10
that France is in a bit of a fiscal mess and he basically wants to have divided
3:16
government so that either the populists or the further left will get blamed for
3:22
all the problems leading into the next presidential election so that's sort of three-dimensional chess of one sort the
3:28
other theory is that macron is just supremely arrogant and thought that you
3:33
know when forced to a binary choice between him and the far right the French
3:40
people you know in their wisdom would return to him and I mean the simplest
3:46
upshot of all of this is that this longstanding attempt to keep the far
3:51
right out of power through any kind of Coalition seems to be the point where
3:56
it's collapsing that's what people seem to think right now yes that the French term for it is Cordon saner right which
4:02
sounds better yes no that's everything sounds better in French they kind of keep the populace right on on sides and
4:09
make sure that they can't actually take power I guess I'm I'm interested in I mean Ross mentioned the two
4:14
possibilities in France right that either macron is doing this bank shot
4:20
where he's trying to reveal the inadequacies of populism by kind of
4:25
bringing them in or he's just supremely arrogant and thinks that a snap election when you're in popular is a good idea it
4:30
can be both right I think getting into those options says something about this question of what populism is reveals a
4:36
kind of nature of populism right if if there are people who think that and this has been articulated in some parts of
4:42
the European press that the best thing you can do to temper populist forces is to bring them in and give them a taste
4:48
of governing that gets at the definition of populism right the populism thrives on its Outsider status on like anti-
4:55
elitism anti-establishment anti-pluralism right claiming sole representation of the people and if you
5:02
bring them in especially in some kind of coalitional or power sharing Arrangement it could either compel some moderation
5:08
or reveal them as a show I think the Trump presidency put the lie to that a little bit on this side of the
5:14
Atlantic but could it make sense in a sort of somewhat less tribal European setting well there are a lot of people
5:20
who argue that the the way to approach this is to have the far-right populist crash up against the reality of
5:27
governing I mean that's actually what people have been calling for in in terms of having the more Centrist parties
5:33
reach out and kind of try and at least engage with this right Ross yeah I mean I think we're at a point where it's sort
5:40
of a mistake to talk about this in terms of like do we welcome the populists or
5:46
not what you see in France is basically just proof of what I think is already obvious in the United States and will be
5:53
obvious basically everywhere over the next 10 or 20 years which is that conservative leaning populism just
6:00
is one of the big coalitions in Western politics right now and they will be in
6:05
government in some form they have already been in government in Italy in various forms going back to Sylvio ber
6:11
lasone Georgia Malone's government you know Maloney is someone who has connections to Italy's fascist parties
6:18
when she was elected there was this similar sense of like well Italy is in fascist hands again and so on but I
6:25
think you can cite Malone's government as sort of partial evidence for the idea that populists in power tend to you know
6:33
moderate to certain degrees um but like in the United Kingdom right now what's
6:39
happening is that in effect the Tories are poised for a historic election
6:45
defeat because they haven't figured out a way to come to terms with the power of
6:50
populism in their own Coalition but the basic reality is that you're going to have right of Center parties that are
6:56
anti-immigration more economically moderate in the sense of not wanting cuts to social programs that just sort
7:03
of represent where right of Center voters in these countries are going forward for a long time to come I mean I
7:10
think I just want to stay on the UK for a second because I think it's it's actually a really interesting example of the kind of cyclical nature of these
7:16
things brexit was a populist movement that was largely spurred on by anxieties
7:22
about immigration in the runup to brexit the number one issue that people would identify to pollsters was was
7:28
immigration and and brexit happens uh you know the toys were already in power but you sort of start to see them kind
7:34
of grow in power and influence but as we go into the election now you're seeing
7:39
that the people's top concerns are things like healthcare which is provided by the National Health Service um and inflation in the economy and immigration
7:46
is actually number four and what's striking is that levels of immigration to the UK are actually still really high
7:53
in fact you know almost historically so and so I think that this is going to be a cyclical thing where populist parties
7:58
come into power they try to actually achieve things uh they fail to deliver real gains in terms
8:04
of uh of standards of living improvements and then they vote the bums out that seems to be the cycle that
8:10
we're in the middle of right now I mean I I disagree on some details but I I do agree in the sense that I think Europe
8:17
has a set of unsolvable problems that populism is a response to but does not
8:25
have adequate solutions for and you see this especially with you know Malone in Italy like Italy's birth rate is headed
8:32
in South Korean directions which is to say that Italy seems destined for Steep
8:38
economic decline Maloney and the right are willing to talk about that problem
8:43
in a way that sort of the respectable Center is uncomfortable talking about it but they don't have any solutions for it
8:50
but they don't have to it's not just that populists offer particular policy programs on matters of trade or
8:57
immigration they're appealed depends on the belief that the regular party the
9:03
regular system can't deal with those problems effectively so populists don't
9:08
really have to offer detailed Solutions as much as they have to argue that traditional Elites don't have a solution
9:14
either right and the problem is the establishment's fault and that the populists alone can fix it that's the
9:20
nature of the appeal of populism well I have a question about the gut level forces driving this and one is aside
9:29
from particular policies or concerns one of the things that at least in Europe
9:35
I'm wondering if it's at play is that you have the question of particularism
9:40
versus like the EU goal of trying to help countries evolve Beyond this like
9:48
that was the whole thing right they were going to you know take this country and that country and mush them all together and it was going to be like you know
9:54
this this great thing that's that's that's exactly what actually the EU Charter says I mean it it does but but
10:00
in in German so the word mush has 27 syllables yeah so but that kind of then
10:06
lends itself to a backlash when you feel like things aren't going right you're just like well you know the real French
10:14
culture German culture are being kind of held captive or taken over by this kind
10:20
of globalist perspective and we need to get back to something where we're taking
10:26
care of our own to some degree yeah I think both the P Green analysis and the
10:32
loada analysis can be correct right it can both be true that populism as a
10:38
force does not actually have solutions for some of the problems it describes in ways that lead populist movements to
10:46
fail at governance and end up voted out of power in turn and so on and yet it's
10:51
also the case that the sort of institutionalists sort of Centrist
10:58
Center left and so on that populism is a RAID against don't have Solutions either
11:03
and you know take an issue like immigration right the populist perspective is these Elites don't know
11:08
how to get British growth let's say British growth has been stagnant for a
11:14
long time they don't know how to get the British economy growing again so they just keep immigration rates rising and
11:19
they say well that way we'll always have workers to staff the NHS or something but that's not actually a strategy for
11:27
permanent long-term growth because the immigrants themselves get older and need more workers to support them and you
11:34
know housing prices go up and nobody's building any housing and so on like there's just a set of of problems that
11:40
the centrists also don't know how to solve and that's why the populists come
11:46
back so we've been talking about the appeal and limits of populism in Europe but after the break we're going to cross
11:52
the pond and we will dive into an interview a really fascinating conversation that you had Ross with an
11:57
influential Republican law law maker who believes that populism holds a lot of promise for the United States in our
12:05
[Music]
12:23
[Music] election so Ross you had a fascinating interview with JD van a figure who has
12:30
emerged in a very very big way he's now on the Trump VP short list he's a junior
12:35
senator from Ohio um he's someone who I think has a very bright political future in the United States why did you want to
12:42
talk to him and what makes him so interesting in this particular moment as we're thinking about populism both at
12:49
home and abroad so this was my I I did not conduct the interview during
12:54
paternity leave uh but it published during my paternity leave so I got a bunch of emails from people saying you
13:00
know did you abandon your baby to go interview the the junior senator from Ohio we know your True loyalty's Lie
13:07
Ross wait a minute they ask women that question all the time I am delighted that they asked you that question they
13:13
no I did well maybe it was just my wife asking me that while I was just felt like everybody um but yeah I mean I
13:20
tried to have I I've known the senator since long before he was a Senator he's
13:26
first very culturally interesting because he's someone who wrote to prominence as a memoirist of
13:32
workingclass Life white workingclass life who was sort of taken up by the
13:37
liberal intelligencia in 2016 2017 as someone who sort of
13:44
explained the you know the pathologies and cultural disarray that led to
13:49
trumpism but who then sort of became a leading trumpist himself that is to
13:54
begin with a kind of fascinating transformation of his sort of place in American culture um but then he's also
14:01
interesting because he is much more than most people most Republican politicians
14:07
who have sort of adopted populism he's someone who's really interested in the policy dilemas around populism that we
14:14
were talking about earlier right that show up in the United States as well as Europe the question of you know can
14:20
populism actually offer solutions to the mix of Economic and cultural problems
14:26
it's interested in so to the extent that there of a place where a populist agenda might come from in a second Trump term
14:33
or over the next 10 or 15 years it's probably going to come from someone like Vance okay so let's dig into the
14:39
interview a little more what are the ideas that are that are driving Vance these days so I spent a lot of time
14:45
talking to him about populist Economic Policy you know which is the least sexy part of the interview in certain ways
14:52
but for my perspective a very important part because the populist economic argument in the US with Trump right was
14:59
that okay Republicans need to stop worrying all the time about cutting entitlements leave Medicare and Social
15:05
Security alone and you know just try and restructure the American economy in ways
15:10
that get especially workingclass men back into the workforce and this was
15:16
basically the argument that that Vance gave me when I asked for sort of a populace vision for the next 10 years it
15:22
was that we're going to use industrial policy and tariffs and immigration restrictions to make it easier to get a
15:29
job as a workingclass native born blueco collar American and that there's going to be a big economic dividend from both
15:38
getting those workers back into the workforce and also sort of forcing companies to innovate more rather than
15:45
just relying on cheap labor this was part of the Senator's argument what I was trying to push him on and which I
15:52
think is going to be a problem for a second Trump administration's Economic Policy right is that the right-wing
15:58
populist coalition in American politics is basically built on saying we're not going to cut a lot of social spending on
16:05
entitlements and so on but we're still in an alliance with the kind of let's
16:11
say Rich wing of the Republican party right so we're also not going to raise taxes that that much or at all but under
16:18
conditions of inflation which again is also what the french populists are going to run into right you start facing hard
16:25
choices really quickly and if you're a populist and you can't either cut spending or raise taxes then you get
16:32
inflation and it's not clear to me that a second Trump Administration has a way out of that trap but I think that part
16:39
of the populist agenda is really important to focus on because it's actually where populist governments are
16:46
likely to succeed or fail I was fascinated by by your interview with JD Vans Ross and in part
16:53
because I I read it Opposite my reading of
16:59
bology um the the um the art of the deal of the future and um and what was
17:06
interesting to me is he starts I I believe he's you know early on in the interview with you he talks about this
17:13
speech he was giving a long time ago at the Chamber of Commerce or something somewhere and he sat next to the CEO who
17:20
was so dismissive of the working class like they got to get off their asses and come in to work right and um he sets
17:27
himself kind of opposite that worldview but like in his book he is no less
17:32
dismissive of the white working class in his community than that CEO that he
17:38
decries right he talks about how in his hometown of of Middletown Ohio you know you couldn't find a single person who
17:44
was aware of his own laziness that folks talk about work more than they actually work that they live off the Dole they
17:49
game the welfare system you know it was not that a series of economic policies were wrong this was a culture in crisis
17:57
like that's how he depicted it that was the subtitle of his book right and that's part of why it was such a crossover hit right like it confirmed
18:03
liberal Elites suspicions about the pathologies of the like the deplorable trumpy voter but also ratified the you
18:11
know lift yourself up by your bootstraps ethos of kind of mainstream conservative thought that was why it was publishing
18:17
genius but he struck me a lot like this guy that he's that he's complaining about in the book so people talk about
18:23
his transformation from I I think I mean I think probably you know the interview
18:28
was extremely long by time standards but still left context on The Cutting Room floor right and and I think the point he
18:35
was making in that anecdote was acknowledging your point right which is to say he wrote a book that included a
18:43
pretty sharp cultural critique of bluecollar America and you know of White
18:48
workingclass Middle America and then he was sort of elevated up into the world of Sun Valley Aspen ideas Festival all
18:57
of these places and found him sitting around with rich people who are like tell us more JD Vance about how these
19:03
people won't get off their asses and and work and how they're lazy and you know
19:08
they deserve to have immigrants come in and take their jobs and at a certain point he decided that his cultural
19:15
critique had been appropriated by forces that he didn't like and in fact disliked
19:21
even more than he had disliked the pathologies of his me ask ask you one
19:27
thing one thing about that is he a True Believer in this sort of champion of the working class or is he a convenient one
19:33
oh I think he's completely sincere having known him a long time and I think the psychology of it which he himself
19:40
says in in the outset sort of makes sense you know it's one thing to sort of critique your own family let's say it's
19:47
another thing to hear that critique offered back to you by some Hotel chain
19:53
magnate right like your perspective changes when you see your own critique
19:58
taken up by people who are you know in a totally different realm of wealth and
20:05
privilege than the people who he grew up with in Middletown I think that's all sincere if you don't want that to happen
20:11
then then like don't write the book you know what I mean like Ross is Ross is totally don't write a bestseller don't
20:17
write a bestell I mean like you're putting it into the world um people are going to interpr but that's a common
20:23
phenomenon the whole like you grow up looking at certain pathologies and
20:29
you're like oh this isn't great but then you wind up entering a different world
20:36
and a different set of pathologies and then you're like oh my god what have I thrown in with I I think that's his
20:43
notion I mean people have made a lot of his transformation from sort of trump critic to you know hardcore Trump
20:48
supporter but this transformation is what I'm most interested in right from sort of cultural critic of his community
20:54
to kind of their Champion so one of the things I I have not known for many years but I've followed him on
21:02
the trail and I too have sat down with him to talk about kind of his role in all of this and I think it it splits for
21:09
me he is very good at explaining the economic aspects of his populism and I
21:16
do genuinely agree with Ross I think he is a genuine economic populist kind of worries about these things thinks about
21:22
these things with the other aspect of populism the kind of US versus is them
21:30
demagoguing he's much slipperier less believable and not so convincing when he
21:38
tries to justify these pieces and what trumpism
21:43
has become whether we're talking about kind of the great replacement theory
21:49
that he flirts with or whether we're talking about his just absurd justifications for trafficking
21:57
and the stop the steel election nonsense so while I think he is
22:03
very genuine in his economic populist leanings I think he is really dishonest
22:11
and slippery when it comes to like trying to convince himself much less anybody else that it's not going hand
22:20
inand with something that's super dangerous that he is aggressively playing along with well let's back up
22:26
because I do want to think a little bit about the tradition in which these ideas sit right like you know populism was not
22:32
invented by Donald Trump it is it has been a strain of American politics for a
22:37
very very long timey long baby so I Carlos maybe you could give us a little bit of a flavor of of that history just
22:43
to situate Us in it as we think about the figures that are emerging now yeah I mean there's a long history of American
22:50
populism and the populist Style in American politics um it's as much a style as sort of a substantive policy
22:57
program but probably the first major standard bearer was William Jennings Bryan you know chronic failed
23:02
presidential candidate Nebraska Democrat Anti-Imperialist anti- monopolist um
23:08
Michelle mentioned huie long right every man a king anti-corporate into wealth
23:13
redistribution super corrupt right uh Louisiana governor US senator George Wallace painted himself the champion of
23:19
the Common Man Alabama Governor segregation now tomorrow and forever also chronic presidential candidate but
23:26
you see the mix of kind of left and right in American populism Ross perau
23:32
another failed presidential candidate but got what close to 19% of the vote if you basically combine the beliefs of
23:38
Ross perau and the cultural War Vibe of P Buchanan you get kind of protot trumpism occasionally you have movement
23:44
politics right like tea party which is a mix of like you know race and economics
23:49
Occupy Wall Street from the left but more often than not it's these very personalistic movements Like Bernie
23:56
Sanders and and Donald Trump are the most recent iterations of that but what I find most interesting about Vance is
24:03
that maybe I'm just letting you know Ross's interview you know wield too much influence over over my well it is it is
24:09
the dispositive journalistic document of our time so you know and I I express my
24:14
my my suspicions of Vance's sort of True Believer here but you know this feels
24:20
like more of a of trying to kind of put a substance around populism than you've
24:26
had in many prior iterations I don't quite see enough to
24:31
buy it yet but that's the tradition that this moment comes out of well I think the norm though in American history has
24:38
been that you have sort of Outsider figures disreputable figures you know
24:44
weirdos cranks oddballs and so on who are the standard bearers of populist
24:50
movements and then you have establishment figures who succeed in taking parts of that Outsider movement
24:58
and bringing them into effective governance right and this is you know what is FDR's
25:04
relationship to huy long and Charles Coughlin right if not a sort of
25:10
successful pulling of ideas from populism while marginalizing certain
25:16
actual populists I think you can say the same thing about Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan with populism on the right
25:21
the challenge now is that there isn't sort of instead of having a kind of
25:27
establish lishment figure who's sort of trying to channel populism you have a
25:33
figure like Trump who is the outsider who sort of taken over and then you have
25:39
other figures Vance others trying to sort of make something out of populism in that shadow um at his smartest I
25:46
think that's what Biden also wanted to do to draw some of the Trump energy on trade and National greatness and
25:52
confronting China and create a center-left governing strategy that's actually how populist eras turn into you
26:01
know sort of more quote unquote normal eras but nobody's figured out a way to do that I mean I think one of the
26:06
reasons that these movements tend to be if not fragile then at least very fraught is because Central to them you
26:14
you have to have kind of the policy elements or the delivery elements but you also just almost always have to have
26:20
this charismatic central figure I mean on our side of the pond we have Trump
26:25
who I think fits that bill but my question Still Remains What happens when
26:30
he's gone because figures like JD Vance don't really have that sparkle now maybe
26:38
they'll grow into it maybe somebody will emerge I mean like but I you know going back to Huey Long who we were talking
26:43
about absolutely terrified FDR's people and you know he was the basis for Robert
26:50
pen Warren's Pulitzer Prize winning All the King's Men and Warren once noted of long he said without this gift for
26:57
attracting myth he would not have been the power he was for good or evil this
27:02
gift was fused with a a dramatic sense and ultimately with the atmosphere of
27:07
violence that he generated I mean this is Trump in a nutshell I mean he is like
27:12
got this huge myth surrounding him which is really really hard to do I mean he is
27:19
a figure a generational defining figure that we're not going to see again and so
27:26
as far as the US goes popism will be around it will percolate you will have
27:31
people like Vance or whoever but I just post Trump if it hasn't kind of dug in
27:38
by then it has missed its moment I think for this cycle populism is always about
27:45
possibilities more than realities right it's about assigning blame more than more than taking responsibility that's
27:52
both the appeal but that's also its kind of built-in limitation there's a lot of
27:58
debate about whether it's a threat to democracy whether populism is is a threat to democracy I think that gets it backward I think that the emergence in
28:05
the Resonance of populist forces is a signal that something is going wrong in
28:11
the regular functioning of democracy already and so trying to to navigate
28:17
that distinction I think is what voters will help us decide well let's leave it there when we
28:23
come back hot and cold [Music]
28:45
[Music] okay and finally it's time for hot cold
28:50
and Ross um I understand that that you're going to be hot colding for us this week in celebration of your return
28:57
so um well we're recording during a heatwave so I'm going to be hot about something and certainly I think one of
29:03
the ways people always ask you know how does having more kids change you I think I'm I'm becoming more optimistic about
29:10
the United States of America as I get older but I'm particularly interested in
29:16
a future America that's pretty distant from me as a sort of Old Stock New Englander living in Connecticut which is
29:23
the sort of Sun Belt America of you know Florida Texas the Southwest up into
29:28
California and lately I think we could all stand to sort of read more history
29:33
about that zone of the United States So lately I've been reading some books by a
29:40
fascinating American journalist named TR ferenbach Carlos have you ever heard of
29:46
TR ferenbach that must be a deep C I have stumped even Carlos Lo even Carlos
29:52
so he was he uh died in 2013 but he was a Texan writer not an academic historian
29:58
I don't think but a sort of writer of popular histories and he wrote three of them that are all very long but could
30:05
sort of be read together one is uh a history of Texas called Lone Star one is
30:11
a history of Mexico called Fire and Blood and one is a history of the
30:17
commanches that I think is just called commanches the history of a people and
30:23
these are sort of written in a kind of florid sweeping ization style I like
30:29
that that's my favorite you love that right but you know plenty of long passages that would not pass any kind of
30:36
political correctness muster but in a kind of omnidirectional way like you know he says things about Native
30:42
Americans that you wouldn't say today and he also says things about the Conquistadors that you might not say today but I recommend these books I
30:49
haven't read every word of every one of them but they're a really interesting sort of deep look at this kind of zone
30:57
of the American landscape it's sort of prehistory the prehistory of let's say Greater Texas or greater Arizona or
31:04
something I think it's going to be is really important for the American future and especially interesting to Yankees
31:12
like myself so TR farbach I think that sounds totally fascinating uh perhaps
31:17
some useful companion reading was a a fascinating uh very long piece that George Packer just published in the
31:23
Atlantic about the Water Crisis in in Arizona it's it's interesting that you identify these places as the future uh
31:30
because I think that they're places that are also very much under environmental strain and require a great deal of
31:36
innovation in order to uh remain large population centers yes and I mean one of
31:42
the again sort of uses of reading prehistories in a way of this modern
31:48
civilization is seeing how these kind of resource constraints have always have always been part of that landscape and I
31:55
really no I really enjoyed the Packer piece it's sort of this wide ranging look that is in certain ways very
32:00
pessimistic but I appreciate it at the end you know he goes up into the southwestern Wilderness at some point
32:07
you know he talks about how it's nice to get out into the Wilderness and away from all the you know populist fighting
32:13
right to connect to our episode theme but at the end he says but now I realized that I was ready to go back
32:19
that was our civilization down in the valley the only one we had better for it to be there than gone and I you know I
32:28
want to endorse that sentiment okay then yeah well this has made me want to plan replan my entire
32:34
summer and uh and go west go west oh I just thought you meant like replan your
32:40
