Why It Had to Be Biden



0:01
this week marks the end of one chapter of this campaign the primary race is over right now and the general election
0:08
starts uh immediately it starts tomorrow morning on the Republican side the time has now come to suspend my campaign
0:16
Trump's only remaining Challenger Nikki Haley is out of the race I said I wanted
0:21
Americans to have their voices heard I have done that I have no
0:27
regrets and on the Democratic Side by secured more than 14400 delegates that
0:32
is more than 72% of the total that he needs to secure the Democratic nomination President Biden swept off 15
0:41
states so it's super Tuesday behind us the matchup that we've been expecting is
0:46
clear another Trump Biden election that November rematch that most Americans
0:51
tell us they don't want well it's exactly what we're all going to get there's 100 million people waking up
0:57
today just absolutely shaking their heads that that that we're in this position regardless of the fact that the
1:03
majority of Americans continue to say that they wish they had other options so for the next 2 weeks I want
1:10
to focus on answering the question we hear more than anything else and answer it more directly than we ever have
1:17
before how exactly do we end up with these two candidates and
1:24
why from The New York Times I'm estad hearnen this is the runup
1:31
on a basic level Joe Biden is the Democratic nominee for a very simple reason this is not a time to be
1:43
complacent that's why I'm running for reelection he decided to run again but
1:48
the path to get there wasn't that simple before the 2022 midterms there
1:53
were a lot of Democrats who were unsure if Biden was the party's best option in 2024 after the midterm elections where
2:01
Democrats did much better than most expected the party moved quickly to consolidate support around
2:07
Biden first top leaders made clear we're sticking with him next the Democratic
2:15
National Committee changed the rules at Biden's request Democrats this weekend
2:21
turning their attention to South Carolina the first time that the state is getting to go first in the Democratic
2:27
primary and a major making South Carolina the first day to vote in the presidential primary Democrats said they did this to
2:34
reward the Loyalty of black voters but it also made it harder for any serious Contender to challenge the president
2:40
considering that South Carolina Democrats are among the most proident in the country so that's where I wanted to
2:47
start with the party's role in making this happen elain Kar I'm a senior
2:52
fellow at the Brooking institution I write books and papers and I'm the
2:58
author of primary politics everything you need to know about how America
3:03
nominates its presidential candidates I went back to Elan kmar I am a at large
3:09
member of the DNC and I'm on the rules committee and I've been on the rules committee for a long long time who I
3:16
first spoke to last year at the DNC meeting where she voted to make those State order changes official know we're
3:22
doing this episode because of a question that comes up all the time for our listeners which is kind of a basic and obvious one just like how did happen you
3:30
know I may seem like an obvious question but I wanted to pose it to you in the direct way we get it from our listeners like why is Joe Biden the Democratic
3:38
nominee in 2024 and how did that happen well he's the Democratic nominee in 2024
3:44
because he is the incumbent president people who are President of the United
3:50
States are in position to make a lot of friends and a lot of people happy which
3:56
he has done over the years most Democrats think he's done a very good
4:01
job uh they're happy with the job he's done they go all the way back to when he
4:06
managed to get uh vaccines in the arms of most of the people in America who
4:12
wanted them and they're grateful to him for that they're grateful to him for straightening out the supply chains in
4:18
the economy and and being able to bring inflation down so mostly they like the
4:24
guy and secondly nobody ran against him or nobody who was very powerful or
4:31
strong ran against him yeah um in other words you can't beat someone with no one
4:36
yeah and that is a that is maybe rule number one of politics so people are
4:42
complaining and complaining they think Joe Biden's too old couple years ago Nancy Pelosi ran for speaker of the
4:49
house and guess what there are a group of young congressmen Mo mostly men some women who thought Nancy Pelosi was too
4:57
old well she got real elected why nobody ran against
5:02
her so listen you you got to have a horse if you're going to beat someone
5:08
and it's very hard to beat an incumbent president and um nobody ran against him and he's going to be our nominee M you
5:15
know last time we spoke was back at the DNC winter meeting in Philly which was just you know more than a year ago and just after the midterm elections and at
5:22
that time I was hearing a lot of the things that I think you're re- reminding people of now you know Democrats were
5:27
riding high from a better than expected midterm and there was pretty Universal confidence in the reelection of Joe
5:32
Biden so much so that people were pretty dismissive at the time I remember kind of being the like the heretic in the room who is saying that like you know
5:39
polling tells us majority of Americans wanted more options or things like that when you think back to last year is
5:45
there anything you would say is different from then to now in terms of maybe the party's relationship or
5:50
thoughts towards November and Biden's prospects of re-election I don't think there's much
5:57
difference I think the party is very unique United and the party voters and
6:03
sort of the party office holders are very United behind Biden one of the things I think we should be reminded of
6:10
and it was evident in 22 but it's much more evident now is that there has been
6:16
nothing that has United the Democratic party more than Donald Trump yes Donald
6:22
Trump because he's an authoritarian because people disagree with him because
6:27
he appointed the Supreme Court justices that overturned row I mean there's just a long long list of reasons why Donald
6:35
Trump keeps the Democratic party absolutely United and while some
6:41
Democrats would rather have a younger candidate Etc people are not going to
6:46
abandon Biden if they think it's going to elect Trump right the prospect of trump keeping Democrats together I
6:52
remember that being a theme of last year I mean that's clear but I also think about the ways that people were telling
6:59
telling me in Philadelphia that oh Biden just needs a little more time that by the end of the year you'll see those approval numbers turn around the
7:05
accomplishments will sink in the polling will turn around and there will be more kind of tangible signs of enthusiasm
7:12
that has not really come yet why don't you think we've seen that movement so far if the party is as United around him
7:19
as you're saying I can't quite explain that okay um I think there's some
7:24
feeling that he's aged a lot okay even though I can tell you that three weeks
7:31
ago I had the privilege of going to the house Democratic retreat in leeburg
7:37
Virginia I sat 20 feet away from the president I watched him give a speech
7:43
then he went off stage and the Press was sent out of the room and he came back
7:49
and sat next to Hakim Jeff the majority leader and about 10 Democratic members
7:55
of the House stood up and asked him questions and and he was he was fine
8:01
right he was answering the questions he had a briefing book on his lap which he would occasionally look at to get a fact
8:07
or a figure but he was perfectly cachent knew all the answers wasn't bumbling around now the interesting thing about
8:14
that afternoon is literally while the president was on stage with us people
8:20
started looking at their phones and the her report broke oh so here we were in a
8:26
ballroom listening to a president who was quite competent and looking at our
8:31
phones telling us that he was demented and it it just was a surreal a surreal
8:37
experience this guy doesn't have any mental problems does he walk funny yeah he's got bad knees or bad back
8:44
something's wrong okay but in terms of the Judgment which is after all what we
8:49
elect a president for he was he was great I've got a mother with dementia I know what dementia looks like it's
8:57
interesting because you do identify that one thing that maybe has changed from last year to this year is a perception of him maybe as older that has sunk in
9:04
but you're saying and Democrats have said kind of consistently you know that is not square up with the reality of the
9:10
person we see nor does that square up with the kind of private reality of the person making decisions I think that story is really interesting that you
9:15
tell right here but I guess I'm like isn't the perception problem a political problem um it absolutely is I mean I
9:22
don't want to underestimate that it absolutely is but I think the other thing to remember is look we don't elect
9:30
presidents for their ability to be high jumpers or longdistance Runners right we
9:35
elect them fundamentally for their judgment and their judge you get how do you get good judgment experience right
9:43
and one one of the things we can say with absolute certainty is that in his
9:49
first term Donald Trump showed consistently poor judgment and we have no indication that
9:57
his judgment has gotten any better right in the years he's been out of office so I think when people settle down and they
10:04
say Okay so the guy looks old the question is what does he say what does
10:09
he do and I would add one more thing to that Washington is a small town okay
10:16
everybody talks to everybody there's just a rumor a minute Etc um the president of the United States must see
10:24
50 100 people every week you're like if he had I get where you're going yeah okay so if he were you got to finish it
10:30
though you got to finish say it I you so so if he were like babbling if he were
10:35
forgetting his lines if we were incoherent guess what we'd all know it
10:41
it would take no time at all cuz so many people he interacts with all these people every week so I I think that this
10:49
will settle down I guess I want to ask in a couple specific ways about the dnc's kind of thinking on that you know
10:56
cuz part of the reason I wanted to talk to you is because the the last time we spoke there were some of those rule changes in the air at the winter meeting
11:03
looking back at the changes in the primary order how would you assess their
11:09
success well I don't think we're going to really we can't really tell if they're quote successful or not because
11:16
we didn't have a contest as to how this is all going to work out you know in 2028 it remains to
11:24
be seen then we'll have an open you know then we'll have an Open Primary then there'll be a lot of people in it but
11:29
this time I think it worked out pretty well yeah I guess and maybe this is you know cynical journalist jumping out but
11:35
part of me thinks that like the purpose of the change of the order was to not
11:41
have a serious contest and is there any validity to the idea that moving South
11:47
Carolina First helped ensure that there were no Challengers uh serious
11:52
Challengers that were going to get into play I I don't think so I don't think that was what was going on there
11:59
okay and I don't think it really operated like that I think that the fact
12:04
that he moved South Carolina First was his thank you to the Loyalty of
12:11
African-American voters to the Democratic party what you have to understand about those early states in the Democratic race or frankly it works
12:18
the same in the Republican race too is that it's all about expectations and if there was somebody who decided to
12:25
challenge Biden and they got 45% of the vote in South Carolina guess what that
12:31
would have been read as a win is there a timeline that you're looking for as someone who's obviously deeply invested
12:36
in the Democrats and Biden is there a timeline to know when these things should turn around or when we should see
12:42
maybe approval numbers or or folks looking more excited like or is it just you know as long as they come through on
12:47
Election Day then that's it and if people want to freak out till then then that's what it's going to be well people
12:53
people will freak out no matter what they will um they will um I think that we will have have Clarity at the end of
13:00
August okay because once we go through both conventions and Trump will present
13:06
himself in the best light that he can yeah we will have a lot of data from his
13:13
various trials as to and people will you know kind of re-evaluate based on what
13:19
comes out of the trials where Trump is Biden will have his convention and make
13:24
his case and connect it to to real people I think we have some clarity then
13:30
okay you know this kind of brings me to my final set of questions I mean I think that it sticks out to me that in this
13:35
conversation a lot of it makes political sense I get how the parties work I get
13:40
how Biden make the decisions and things like that how we kind of arrived here in the in the kind of classic answer to our
13:46
question but it does strike me that like the Public's desires that we have heard consistently over the last 3 four years
13:53
about wanting more options about wanting kind of younger candidates don't seem to really factor in I guess if I was a
13:59
Democrat who doesn't hate Biden but just wanted other options or was nervous about having a president who would be 86
14:05
at the end of their second term from the DNC perspective like what is your message to
14:10
me nobody else ran my message to you is nobody else ran okay so in the absence
14:18
of somebody else running um you have to support Joe Biden I mean pure and simple
14:24
that's where we are you you simply can't randomly say oh yeah well I'm worried
14:30
about Biden's age if there's no other alternative you need Alternatives the Republicans are also worried about Trump
14:37
they're worried about his nuttiness they're worried about his age his criminal indictments Etc they they got a
14:43
lot to worry about they are having a race right Nikki Haley is not beating
14:49
Trump but at least there is some place Republican voters can go to if they
14:56
really want to be against Trump and express their their distaste for Trump
15:03
Democrats don't have any place they can go yeah I do think that that is true I guess I just want to push on a second
15:09
though like it's not as if Democrats National Democrats were neutral actors
15:15
here we you know we we have reporting about the Biden campaign kind of doing a private discouragement of other people
15:21
getting in the race we know that the state order was changed uh we know that state some state democratic parties like
15:26
places in North Carolina have left violence Challengers completely off the ballot I'm not saying that there's like some Mass conspiracy or anything I guess
15:34
I'm saying like does party Politics as Usual has it contributed to the reality
15:40
that for a lot of people we talk to feels kind of undemocratic feels like not what they wanted you know I guess
15:48
I'm saying like at what point was the public in this you know well the public
15:53
gets in it when they vote yeah and look these polls have been around for two
15:59
years and they were not persuasive enough to get somebody to throw their
16:04
hat in the ring yeah and so Democrats who are nervous about Biden are left
16:11
with really no alternative because no one got in I mean was Maryann Williamson
16:17
a better option than Joe Biden no nobody thought so so you know you didn't have a
16:23
Gavin Nome throwing his hat in the ring and nothing kept him from doing that he
16:29
could have raised a lot of money he could have gone out there he could have done that nothing really kept him from
16:34
doing it other than sense other than a sense that Biden had done a good job and
16:41
that he was a steady hand on the tiller I are we sure about that I mean I think
16:47
not that not that Biden has done good job that's what I'm saying but when I ask people why didn't they run there's a kind of recognition that there is such a
16:53
social kind of pressure such a deference to incumbency that like tradition itself matters just as much if not more as if
16:59
the person's doing a good job like how should we rank tradition and deference in with people's legitimate assessment
17:05
of Joe Biden as president listen if you read some American history you will find that presidents who were not thought to
17:11
be doing a good job they had Challengers so let me start with President Gerald
17:18
Ford in 1976 Who challenged him Ronald Reagan let's go to President Jimmy
17:25
Carter who in 1980 was not thought to be doing a very good job Who challenged him
17:31
Senator Kennedy y okay in other words there's been plenty of instances where
17:37
candidates or incumbent presidents who were thought to be doing a bad job they got themselves a powerful Challenger
17:45
from within the party and that happened in both parties so you need that predicate the predicate is the president
17:52
has to have not been perceived by the members of his party to not be doing a
17:58
good good job and that is not the same as just being old got it that's clear I
18:04
guess my last question would just be a a year change you know we last talked to you last year and there was Confidence
18:10
from Democrats and from you about where Joe Biden was heading in to re-election a year from now like with with us with
18:17
us in the New Year closer to November where are you now um I'm still confident
18:23
I think that the age issue has increased it surprised me sort of the extent to
18:29
which that has increased over this year but I would point out that in starting
18:35
in 2018 and all the way up through the special elections in
18:41
2023 Democrats have outperformed the polls so there's this P pervasive sort
18:47
of pessimism going on in Democratic circles and then we get to election
18:52
day and guess what the Democrats are winning Democrats took the enti entire
18:58
Virginia irginia legislature this year when everybody was thinking oh no they're only going to take one they
19:04
maybe could take one house so this over performance of Democrats when it comes
19:09
to real elections I think has been the most positive thing for Democrats and it
19:15
makes me still optimistic that Biden will win um in 2024 there's enough signs
19:20
of top to bottom party Health that no matter the kind of criticisms of the individual candidates age or things like
19:26
that you think the Democratic party has put itself in the position I think they are in a good position and I think that
19:32
it as in politics the Democrats are lucky because the Republicans have put themselves in a bad position they're
19:38
about to nominate somebody who's under criminal indictment and they reversed Ro v Wade you know I really appreciate your
19:45
time I really appreciate your honesty and thank you so much for taking some time out you are quite welcome nice to talk to
19:54
you so the question of why and how Joe Biden became the Democratic nominee is a
19:59
little more nuanced than just saying the party decided nobody ran against Biden he
20:06
continues to win in the primary contest held so far and for a lot of Democrats especially at the top levels of the
20:12
party Biden has a host of policy accomplishments he can point to that make them totally comfortable with the
20:18
idea of his re-election bid and unreceptive to the idea that there's anything undemocratic about what's
20:25
happened here we'll be right
20:31
[Music]
20:38
back so the Democratic party cleared the way for President Biden to run again without a serious challenge as is
20:46
tradition but that's only one piece of the equation when it comes to why Joe Biden is asking for four more years the
20:53
other piece is that Biden himself is absolutely convinced that he's the person singularly suited to beat Donald
21:00
Trump the only person who can even at 81 years old that was made very clear in
21:06
the New Yorker piece that came out this week where Biden explained how he's thinking about his
21:11
candidacy he said he was always planning to run for re-election and reiterated
21:16
that he's the Democrat best position to win with that in mind I wanted to go
21:22
inside the Biden Inner Circle to understand the president's thinking and push on the
21:28
behind his absolute conviction hello can you hear me hello EST how are you I'm doing well how are you thank you for uh
21:35
joining us thanks for having me can you introduce yourself and tell me what you do I'm Ron Cay I used to be chief of
21:41
staff at the White House a short uh short and sweet what do you do now uh I'm in the private sector
21:47
I I'm a general counsel for a large company so I called Ron clay a trusted voice in Biden World CLA has worked with
21:55
Biden on the policy side and the political side side he was a senior adviser for Biden's 2020 presidential
22:01
run before joining him in the White House you know one of the reasons we wanted to talk to you is that for a lot
22:07
of people I think you function as a standing for President Biden himself you know you served as the first Chief of Staff as you said you previously served
22:13
as Chief of Staff when he was a vice president you were a senior advisor on the Biden 2020 campaign and you're one
22:19
of the members of the kind of Biden Inner Circle when did you first meet Joe Biden I'm curious I first met uh now
22:25
President Biden back in 1986 in 1986 he was getting ready to run for president 1988 and his chief
22:33
strategist was a guy named John martilla based in Boston I'd work with John on a number of campaigns in the Boston area
22:39
and John urged me to get involved in the Biden campaign so I did that's a long scope of knowing a person not only as a
22:45
boss but as a person a political figure how would you describe the Joe Biden that you know not just as a politician
22:51
but as a individual as a boss he's a very compassionate and caring person uh
22:58
he's always been very supportive for me and my family and I love the man in 2015 Joe Biden decided not to run
23:07
for president and you joined Hillary Clinton's campaign you have experience in the art of running against Donald
23:12
Trump before I ask about 2020 or 2024 I wanted to ask kind of about your work in
23:17
2016 is there anything about that that you took with you to 2020 or even applies to now look I think it's a
23:24
mistake to underestimate Donald Trump it's a mistake to underestimate his ability to take candidates and morph
23:30
their image in the public mind and he was able to do that successfully with secretary Clinton he wasn't able to do
23:35
that with former Vice President Biden in 2020 I think that was a big part of the difference so I think you need a certain
23:41
kind of candidate to beat Donald Trump that's a candidate that's hard to characterture and hard to build a false
23:49
image of which is what Trump is good at it's what he did to his Republican opponents in the primaries in 2016
23:54
successfully that's what he did to Hillary Clinton in 2016 I think Biden is is a little bit Teflon on that mhm mhm
24:00
well that's a helpful I mean part of our premise in our episode today is to answer really central question that we
24:05
get from a lot of Voters and our listeners we also POS this to Alan kmar of the DNC and I know it's like a basic
24:11
one in political kind of world because President Biden is obviously the incumbent president and for most of History incumbent presidents have always
24:16
run for re-election but I guess I wanted to ask more broadly why is Joe Biden running for re-election particularly
24:22
given that you know most of Americans including some Democrats consistently say that in our reporting and in
24:28
National polling that they thought he was too old to run again well I would say this a lot of people have run
24:33
against Donald Trump only one has ever beaten him and that's Joe Biden so I think he is running in part because he's
24:40
succeeded in defeating Donald Trump and I think he's our best option to defeat Donald Trump in 2024 protect our
24:46
democracy I also think he's done a good job as president he ran on a very aggressive agenda for president to have
24:53
the country recover from the pandemic to address four crises he saw a crisis of
24:58
the economy in the wake of the pandemic a crisis of climate change crisis of
25:04
racism uh and obviously then the healthcare Crisis coming out of the pandemic and so we set to work on day one to try to address all four crises
25:11
and I feel like we made good progress in all four of them Al there's a big unfinished agenda and he's running to finish that agenda I think he has a
25:17
track record that merits re-election and an agenda that will drive a second term
25:22
and The Proven track record of taking on and defeating Donald Trump you know I want to dig deeper there part go back to
25:28
2020 to do that because you mentioned the first one about he's the person to beat Donald Trump and he has the proven
25:34
track record there I remember President Biden's age kind of being an open discussion back in 2020 even some folks
25:40
thinking he should take a pledge to serve only one term can you take me inside the campaign at the time you were
25:46
a senior adviser was there any discussion of his Advanced age at that point and how did you all go about
25:51
trying to respond to the pressure of those concerns well obviously it was an issue in 2020 people rais Ed it but you
25:59
know I think he defeated it by campaigning by putting his agenda before the country he had I think a bold agenda
26:05
that I think helped reject the idea that he was too old because he was very forward-looking on issues like climate
26:10
change and race and other issues like that and I think that that agenda and his energy in the campaign his success
26:18
in debating Donald Trump in the fall I think all overcame those objections age was an issue in 2020 it's an issue in
26:24
2024 but it's an issue and there are other issues too I think the sum of the issues favored Biden in 2020 I think
26:31
they will again in 2024 M I also though remember at the time during the Democratic primary there being some
26:38
discussion of this and Biden said you know I view myself as a bridge not as anything else Biden also said I view
26:43
myself as a transition candidate I know a lot of people who interpreted that at Biden at the time saying that he was
26:49
only going to serve one term including media stories that quoted top Biden advisers was that not a message that was
26:55
coming from the campaign back in 2020 that there was a possibility that there would just be one term of President Biden well I think the first had to be a
27:03
term and so I don't think people in 2020 were worried about a second term we're worried about beating Donald Trump and
27:09
ending the four-year disaster we had seen so um you know I think the president is a bridge he obviously comes
27:15
from another generation his successor will be of a different generation than he is so I think that is definitely what
27:21
the four or eight years is going to be about and I think that also you know he I understand there was a lot of skepticism in 2020 the York Times
27:28
endorsed not one but two other candidates in the primaries and wrote off his candidacy in a single paragraph
27:33
in the endorsement editorial very dismissive paragraph and so there's been a lot of skepticism about him from the
27:38
start he's overcome that skepticism Democratic voters nominated him in 2020 uh he is getting a strong vote in the
27:45
primaries in 2024 as well and I think that that's where he will be proven at the polls ultimately on Election Day I
27:51
guess I'm asking because when we are on the road we talk to so many people including Democrats who say that it did
27:58
not even enter their mind the prospect that they would be voting for Biden in a kind of second term that they thought
28:03
that there was a kind of implicit understanding of they didn't know what was going to happen but that they were kind of pulling an emergency lever in
28:08
2020 there was a lot of stories at the time I remember about the signaling of the possibility of one term I'm asking
28:14
did you all overcome those concerns in the campaign partially by signaling to voters both publicly and Biden
28:20
statements and privately in media stories that he may serve one term that that was a possibility
28:28
uh I think we overcame those concerns by defeating Donald Trump so uh I don't think the C the campaign was not running
28:34
on a message of one term and in fact that was suggested that he make that pledge he did not he specifically did
28:40
not and uh I think you know voters got what they expected in 2020 and now he's
28:46
running again in 2024 you know I saw in the New Yorker piece where President Biden is quot extensively him say that
28:53
it was never a doubt in his mind that he was going to run for reelection and I guess guess the certainty of that
28:58
message kind of stood at odds with some of the things I felt like I had heard back in 2020 and I think it kind of
29:03
public sensed about Biden and the choice that they were making in 2020 I'm wondering was it clear to you or others
29:10
that he was kind of certain to run for reelection as he has said and if so is that something a public maybe should
29:16
have known in 2020 as they were electing an oldest president to ever be inaugurated well I think that I think
29:23
the president's certainty about this came as he became president and he had success in delivering on some of the
29:29
promises and then we had a stunning success in the 2022 midterms which was unexpected and uh I think validated his
29:36
approach I never heard him express any doubts about running for reelection but he didn't run in 2020 to run for two
29:42
terms we run in 2020 to get elected he did get elected and he's been serving as president uh you know another 2020
29:48
decision I want to ask about is the selection of Vice President KL Harrison specifically but I've know this is another big gap between kind of how the
29:54
politics is talked about and maybe the Public's understanding of it you know it was my understanding in the profile I
29:59
reported for the New York Times magazine last year that Harris was selected as Biden's running mate to be a quote governing partner as Biden's 2020
30:06
campaign Chief Anita Dunn told me at the time but I think for a lot of people they thought it was Biden kind of following through on that previous
30:12
promise to build a new generation that they were maybe setting up the president in waiting I wanted to ask how was the campaign thinking about the selection of
30:19
Vice President Harris at the time and how should voters think about her on the ticket right now well I think the
30:24
president's first priority in picking a vice president was to find someone who' be a partner in governing uh there's no
30:30
question about it and then Senator Harris was his pick and I think she's done a very good job as vice president
30:36
working with him on a lot of important issues both domestically and internationally and I don't know what
30:41
her political future will be that'll be up to her but um she's done a good job as vice president and I think as an
30:48
asset for the president 2024 she's very effective with voters she was effective on the campaign Trail in 2020 she will
30:55
help him win in 2024 M you know Republicans are making a really explicit argument that a vote for President Biden
31:01
is a vote for president Harris if I am someone thinking about the argument Republicans are making on that side how would you as a Democrat or you know
31:08
Biden campaign respond to that a vote for President Biden is a vote for the Biden Harris team uh Joe Biden will be
31:15
president kamla Harris will be vice president she'll continue to help him as she has make the hard decisions and give
31:20
him advice but Joe Biden is running to be president and I'm confident if he's reelected he'll serve all four years M
31:27
all right then how should I think about the kind of place that Elise polling or some our reporting would tell us we're
31:33
in Bloomberg morning conso says Biden's trailing Trump by an average of Five Points in swing States like North
31:38
Carolina Arizona Georgia Nevada the times poll over the weekend find Biden trailing Trump 43% to 48% even if you
31:46
don't find the kind of horse race takeaway to be the main thing here which I think we probably both agree it's too early to treat these things as
31:52
determinative I guess I'm asking what can Democrats take away from a consistency of results that does seem to
31:59
say that the president does have a sticking unpopularity and that the kind of policy accomplishments that I hear
32:05
about from Democrats and I understand passed in a bigger way than folks expected doesn't seem to have
32:10
necessarily translated to folks just yet how should we think about this the way I think about it is that elections are
32:17
choices and each time during his term voters have gone to the polls they've chosen Joe Biden the Democrats over the
32:23
Republican Party led by Donald Trump we had a stunning historical result in 2022
32:28
and just recently in a special election in New York Democrats took back a seat held by the Republicans so I think that
32:34
there are polls that running newspapers and there's polls we have at polling places and the president has delivered
32:39
results for the party and the polls at polling places so that's what I would say to people I guess there's not really
32:44
a conflict between the results we see in the in the large portions of the democratic party and even the polling
32:50
numbers we see right like the polling tells us that Biden has a unique problem that does not translate to the rest of
32:55
the party and a lot of the evidence says that the party when it runs candidates that are not respectfully 81 that they
33:01
do fine and so I guess I'm saying is there anything that Democrats or the Biden campaign is doing about a question
33:10
that does seem unique to this candidate well I think that President knows that
33:15
age is ining the campaign he said that he's acknowledged that I think you're going to see the president on the stump
33:20
we get into the campaign season and obviously he'll appear before the entire country this week State of the Union
33:26
Address people can be able to assess the president how he's doing and I think that uh you know he'll be a vigorous
33:32
campaigner on his own behalf uh but I think we have to make the argument that his age allows him to have more wisdom
33:38
and perspective as president at a time of a complex and a dangerous world that Joe Biden's the person you want dealing
33:43
with this mess we have in Europe with Putin invading Ukraine and you want Joe Biden solving these hard problems
33:49
because he's got the experience to do that and certainly if the choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump I think Biden's a better choice has anything
33:56
changed for you and just the broader landscape I hear the kind of consistency of the argument and I think it's one that I understand you're saying once the
34:02
stakes are clear come election day you think the folks will make the choice to back Biden I get that I guess I'm saying is there anything from last year to now
34:09
that you do think has posed a greater challenge than expected well I do think that the
34:14
situation in the Middle East creates a division in our party and concern in the country as it should and so I think it's
34:20
another thing he has to address you know it's another problem that he has to solve as president so I think that has
34:26
changed I I think that's another burden on him but I think there's no better person in the Oval Office to do that than President Biden and i' say the
34:32
other thing that's changed in the past years is the economy is getting better the progress continues to be in the right direction and I think as that
34:39
continues it'll sink in with voters you're starting to see consumer confidence rise it takes a while for people's perceptions of the economy to
34:46
come around and uh I think it will in a way and help lift the president even further politically so I'm positive
34:51
about the economy and positive about his ability to address these foreign crises yeah it does seem like that is also the
34:57
big change the situation in Gaza you know the Biden team has made a consistent pitch about his White House accomplishments domestic ones like the
35:03
covid bill infrastructure chips bill being things that voters can kind of tangibly see and understand and that
35:09
would be a benefit to him but it does seem like the kind of international crisis has overtaken the policy slate
35:15
now we're hearing a lot more about pushes on the administration both from a left and a senator who has kind of push
35:21
back against the unwillingness to call for a ceasefire I saw the vice president statements on Su day I wondered should I
35:28
take that change of position as a tcid acknowledgement that maybe the month-long refusal to embrace a
35:34
ceasefire has imperil the re-election chances and if not how does Biden speak to those people to win them back first
35:40
of all I think what the vice president said is consistent what the president's been saying which is that they want a ceasefire a deal where the hostages come
35:46
home and there's a ceasefire in exchange for the hostages that's what the president's been talking about for
35:52
several weeks now and I think the vice president was simply iterating that over the weekend M so I don't think there's a change of position here I think there is
35:58
increased urgency behind the humanitarian suffering in Gaza but I can't think of a person better equipped
36:03
to deal with this crisis than Joe Biden you know I have a last couple question I really appreciate you kind of being a
36:09
proxy for us and taking this time you know I hear what you're saying and it reminds me that you know Biden's said in
36:15
this article you know in the New Yorker this week that he's running because he's the best suited person to beat Donald
36:20
Trump but as we're talking here I've real you know two things have changed since 2020 one he is older and that
36:26
concern has loomed bigger in the American electorate kind of mind and second you know the original 2020
36:33
campaign did have that sense of a bridge to it the request to ask people to pull
36:39
that kind of emergency lever and both of those things are different does any part of you worry that the conditions of this
36:44
election are so different than the one four years ago that the president's logic of why he's best suited no longer
36:50
applies no I think that you're you seem stuck on this idea that he promised a single term in 2020 which he explicitly
36:56
did not I I guess and I think that he didn't just narrowly get across the line
37:01
in 2020 he won with the largest vote for any candidate for president in the history of the country and won
37:07
overwhelmingly in the primaries against one of the largest most talented Fields anyone's ever faced and you know
37:13
defeating two dozen candidates in the nomination battle for president including a dramatic Victory on super
37:19
Tuesday in 2020 uh so I think that you know his victory in 2020 wasn't some
37:24
kind of just like you know reluctant Act of the American people it showed record levels of vote in the general and um I
37:33
think what's changed since then is I'll admit he is older but he also is even more experienced he has delivered
37:39
results and uh he also has an agenda for 2024 so yes 2024 is obviously a
37:44
different election than 2020 it's four years later different issues but the candidates are going to be the same and
37:50
I think the outcome will be the same I guess I'm not really stuck on the words that he says I'm saying that the words
37:55
that he said are indicative of a larger feeling that we hear all the time which is that an American public did not
38:01
expect Joe Biden to be running for two terms and we hear this from Democrats Independence like across the aisle I
38:07
guess I'm saying if you don't think that that was a perception the 2020 campaign gave to people why do you think it's such a surprise that the president's
38:13
running for reelection I don't know why it's a surprise that he's running for re-election he never suggested otherwise
38:20
and um I think that uh ultimately the people will speak at the polls and I
38:25
think when they speak at the polls and they have the choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump they will choose Joe Biden and he will be our president
38:32
again is saying I I okay I I I guess I can move on I can move on you've answered the question and I totally
38:38
understand it could anything happen this year that would change kind of where you are and say you know maybe Joe Biden
38:44
isn't best suited to be the Democratic nominee in November nothing that I can imagine no
38:49
okay you know recently my colleague Ezra Klein made a kind of explicit case saying that the people Biden listens to
38:55
Barack Obama Chuck Schumer uh he named some other folks including you need to get him to see that Biden might not be
39:01
best position I wanted you to respond to that sense of argument that has certainly been in the air and I guess I actually had a broader question which is
39:08
like is that even the thing that's appropriate or people even do in your position or is it just Joe Biden's
39:15
decision well I think ultimately it is his decision and the decision of the Democratic primary voters who are voting
39:21
for him in overwhelming numbers to be our nominee so I'll leave it at that look if I thought he wasn't the right
39:27
candidate to be Donald Trump I wouldn't be for him running but I think he is the right candidate and I think that people
39:33
like Ezra who haven't really been in this business underestimate how difficult it is to beat Trump and have a
39:39
view that just any generic Democrat could beat Trump and I'll say it's much more complicated than that and I think
39:45
you need someone with the right candidate profile and the right skills I think that is Joe Biden and I think you defeated Trump once I think he'll do it
39:51
again I wonder the specifics on candidate profile what is it about Joe Biden that makes you think he's harder
39:57
to character well I think he has a workingclass background that resonates with voters um you know the man from
40:04
Scranton I think the fact that he's had a very pro-union record as president
40:09
really connects with working people I think that ultimately makes it harder for Trump to make him into something
40:14
exotic you know he wasn't born with a silver spoon he didn't come from privilege he came from you know the
40:21
industrial heartly end of the country and he's proven he can go toe-to-toe with Trump on the debate stage and hold
40:27
his own and so I think that uh to me performance is a good indicator and he performed in 2020 I think he'll perform
40:33
again in 2024 you know four years ago I remember folks making this argument Biden's favor it really bore out both in
40:39
the primary and in the general and I hear that and I I respect the consistency of which Biden has proven
40:44
that argument in tangible votes but I also feel like one thing that's changed the last couple years is that Biden at
40:51
least in the public has become age charactered right even if it's outside
40:56
of the actual personal qualities even if it's not the person and president that you see every day how do you combat
41:01
against that character even if his bio and his personhood is still understood
41:07
by the American public I think we have to sell his as I said his age is an asset with the wisdom it brings the
41:14
experience it brings and look I think some voters will vote against him for that reason but I think some voters vote for him for that reason and I think he's
41:20
also overperforming with voters over 65 and that changes the map quite a bit
41:26
because of older populations in places like Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania look I think age is an issue but it's
41:32
just an issue there are other issues abortion is an issue and the economy is an issue and so I think when voters go
41:38
into the polls you know they'll have a balance in their minds and there'll be some negative things on Biden's side
41:44
more negative things on Trump's side some positive things for Biden some positive things for Trump I think in that balance Biden will come out ahead
41:51
you know what both sides agree on is election is the stakes or at least the size of them right when we go to D
41:56
events or R events they say the country is on the line and for Democrats specifically it's about the prospect of
42:02
trump installing a wide range of anti-democratic reforms changing our political system our immigration system
42:07
our Judicial System all of the above and I know that for the next six months I'm going to hear arguments from National
42:12
Democrats and the party saying to people who might be upset with Biden or might prefer someone younger or might not
42:18
prefer a certain policy here or there that they should put those things aside because the stakes are so large but I do
42:24
think there is some kind of missing acknowledgement that like isn't it also a risky thing for the party to do to
42:31
nominate the 81-year-old in compit who a majority of Americans perceived as too old in the first place like isn't that a
42:37
big risk too to me the risky thing would be when you have someone who's beaten Trump going with an unproven National
42:44
candidate to try to defeat someone who has run for president twice before and is now running a third time in Donald
42:49
Trump so I mean there's risks on both sides here and every candidate has risks
42:54
and what the president risks is inexperienced in the National stage inexperience in dealing with Trump he
43:01
has those things and those are assets I think in the race that some of these public criticisms are under counting or
43:06
undervaluing I hear that I guess my last question is okay we get the state of play we get kind of where we are I've
43:11
poed all the age questions to you The Binding campaign has made the similar argument that you have made here that the stakes will eventually bear them out
43:18
so is that just going to be like a stay the course till election day and that the day after the election we'll see
43:25
type of thing or is there something about the evidence we have seen over
43:30
sometimes or some of the polling we have seen or some of the critiques we have heard that is going to require the Biden
43:36
campaign to change a strategy before then like what do we think might shift because some of the arguments I hear from you all aren't things that have to
43:42
change it's just going to be like a we'll tell you the day after and we'll be proven correct well I think what has
43:47
to change about the Biden campaign is we have to have a campaign so I mean there's going to be an election the president will go out he'll campaign
43:53
people will hear his argument I think they'll be persuaded by it I think the more they see him out there on the stump the more they'll be saged about his age
44:00
they see him debating Donald Trump going to-to Toe with Trump I think again they'll be reassured about his age and their doubts about Trump will be
44:06
reinforced but you know the thing that has to change about the campaign is we need to have a campaign and that will come and again four years ago at this
44:14
time there were a lot of doubts about Joe Biden doubts about whether or not he would ever become the nominee and he overcame those doubts and you could have
44:20
said to me then well what's going to change I'm say what's going to change is we'll start voting and we'll see him win and that's what it took so you know let
44:27
the campaign unfold I I totally hear that too because I remember those times I remember people telling us that Biden was down and out I would like to say
44:33
that like you know those of us who were reporting around black folks in South Carolina never thought that but I do think that a lot of people did think
44:38
that I guess I'm wondering your confidence level it as a broader question all I hear about when people ask me about Biden is people bring up
44:46
you know age how much space did that topic take up in the Inner Circle versus
44:51
how much space that topic takes out in the Outer Circle look I think everyone around the president knows this is one
44:57
of the principal objections to his re-election so it takes up a lot of time and they understand it has to be addressed you've heard the president
45:04
himself personally addressed it in recent weeks and he'll continue to address it but I think the best way to address it is by him campaigning and
45:10
showing voters what he's doing to lead the country and to solve these hard problems in the world and you know
45:16
framing up the choice and so I think when voters see them up close when they have a chance to go to the polls and
45:22
cast their vote they have been casting their vote in the primaries for him I think only way to resure it is to get out their campaign answer the questions
45:29
and continue to press his agenda thank you so much I really appreciate your time and we really do get this from so
45:34
many people I think it's going to be very valuable for them to hear someone who's as close to the president uh respond directly to it my pleasure
45:41
thanks for having
45:47
me tonight President Biden will deliver the final State of the Union Address of
45:52
his first term in office traditionally the state of the union is a time for the president to
45:58
recount his accomplishments and it's that record plus the unique threat of Donald Trump
46:04
the Democratic leaders think will carry Biden to Victory Democratic voters seem less
46:09
certain in polls in interviews they're worried about Biden's age they wonder if
46:16
he's their best option and why he's their only option but after hearing from kmar and
46:22
Clay the answer seems clear Biden's nomination happened in large part
46:28
because of tradition deference and the adherence to Convention that governs party
46:34
leaders it happened because of Politics as normal the
46:40
problem these are abnormal
