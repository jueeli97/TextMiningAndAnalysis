The Newest Tech Start-Up Billionaire? Donald Trump



0:01
from New York Times I'm Michael babbaro this is the [Music]
0:12
daily over the past few years Donald Trump social media company truth social
0:18
was dismissed as a money losing boondoggle today Matthew Goldstein on
0:25
how over the past few days it somehow became a publicly traded company worth
0:32
billions of [Music] [Applause]
0:42
dollars it's Thursday March [Music]
0:51
28th Matthew thank you for coming thank you for having daily your debut yes do
0:56
you go by Matt I go by Matt I go by Matt you're a Matthew by line CU my mother
1:01
likes me using when I first started out my mom says I named you Matthew you
1:06
should use Matthew for your bi because I initially did use Matt and then she she got it this is literally the tale of
1:12
right the Jewish mother yes yes the way all journalism sort of starts you know why did you go into journalism to begin
1:17
with though right you could have been a doctor here we are at least use my name okay so Matt I wonder if we could start
1:24
by having you tell us the current market value of this new publicly traded
1:31
company Donald Trump's social media business okay so as we sit here 11:26
1:37
a.m. on Wednesday on Wednesday it's trading right now for around $65 a share
1:44
if you work that out it's worth about eight billion that's huge that is huge I
1:49
think it's bigger than the New York Times actually I think the New York Times is like around seven billion it's bigger than a lot of companies you know
1:56
which is crazy when you think about it yeah and what is Donald Trump's personal
2:02
stake in that and what is that now worth okay so he owns 79 million shares so
2:08
roughly doing the math and this changes it's somewhere around 5.6 billion it's
2:14
been going up sometimes as high as even $6 billion that's extraordinary that is
2:19
extraordinary because if you believe what forbs had said last fall he was worth about 2.6 billion so he's more
2:26
than doubled his net worth in basically a last few days with Trump media wow and
2:35
not a moment too soon right because as we've talked about on the show Trump owes about every last scent of cash he
2:43
has I think it's an estimated 500 million or so to various courts and this
2:49
would be very auspicious timing to suddenly have an extra5 billion in his life it's a
2:56
critical Lifeline for him right now there of course are limitations to how
3:02
he can tap that money but I think also it should not be understated it's a huge
3:07
bragging point for him right which he likes to go out and talk about being the most successful businessman on the
3:13
planet he can say look I built a company that's worth s billion dollar overnight
3:19
where have you done that Joe Biden or where have you done that pretty much almost anyone other than a very select
3:25
rarified group of tech startups absolutely so tell us the story of how
3:30
this company which I think a lot of people candidly dismissed from the beginning as Trump's little kind of
3:38
renegade corner of the internet somehow became this a real Financial Behemoth in
3:46
a way what is that story so you have to go back to January 2021 MH Trump is
3:54
kicked off of what was then Twitter after the January 6 riots at the capital and not just Twitter right Facebook inag
4:01
he kicked off everything but Twitter was really where he had lived as we all knew right tens of millions of followers tens
4:07
of millions so Trump is at the slow point he's out of the White House he's sort of down there in maral Lago and all
4:15
of a sudden a blast from the past he gets approached by these two
4:21
guys who had been contestants on his old reality show The [Music]
4:28
Apprentice and their names are Andy latinsky and West Moss I'm no dummy no I know you
4:37
know TR they're not particularly notable or famous people I don't know if the word is stars on the show to be
4:44
perfectly honest I want to see Mr Trump as much as possible latinsky was a really young guy I chose to the men
4:51
dominating the women West Moss came up sort of as like almost like a frat boy type of character
5:00
you're fired Wes you're fired
5:06
also and they weren't particularly successful but they go to Trump and what
5:12
exactly is their pitch to him their pitch is basically forget about Twitter forget about all these other platforms
5:19
create your own platform create your own social media company it'll be great you won't be censored you can say whatever
5:25
you want all your followers will come here we make a lot of money will be huge
5:32
what was Trump's response well he's intrigued but he never really totally commits to anything at that point Trump
5:39
is sort of taking a backseat on it he's basically agreeing to lend his name if nothing else right they sign an
5:46
agreement that they're going to go out and sort of pitch the deal and The
5:51
Apprentice guys know that they're going to need a lot of money to get this company off the ground but they're not
5:59
not going to be able to turn to traditional Wall Street sources because Trump at this pointx yeah he's a toxic guy so the
6:07
solution for The Apprentice guys to raise this money was to do something called a spack h which is these
6:15
companies that have come into Vogue during the pandemic they're basically shell companies that go public raise
6:22
hundreds of million dollars from investors and essentially their sole purpose is to go out and look for
6:28
another company to buy kind of shell companies shell company right it's basically money in a bank account that's
6:34
just sitting there to be transferred over to the private company that you buy
6:40
so for the private company that ends up merging it's a great deal because they get tons of cash where they had nothing
6:47
the day before MH and the other advantage of a deal with the spec is that beyond the cash the private company
6:53
becomes a public company and that gives it the ability to sell stock to investors and go out and raise more
7:00
money that way and then through that merger eventually the two companies
7:05
coming together the company that Trump is going to be ostensibly heading that social media company would get
7:13
everything the spa could raise from investors so all that cash is going to come flooding into the company The
7:20
Apprentice guys Invision so if I'm understanding his plan correctly The Apprentice guys Envision a plan where
7:27
they go off they find a back that has raised a bunch of money and eventually
7:32
it will merge with the Trump social media company they Envision building and
7:38
when that marriage is consummated their work will be over and they will hopefully have a lot of money basically
7:44
that's exactly what their goal was yeah so The Apprentice guys are out there in the market looking for a spack but given
7:52
the lack of really any kind of business plan they don't go to like the Top Flight guys out there they end up at the
7:59
bottom of the barrel okay and so they end up with essentially a very no-name
8:04
sounding spack called Digital World acquisition Corporation digital world
8:09
has its IPO in September of 2021 raises $300
8:15
million lo and behold like a month after a press release comes out late at night
8:22
Donald Trump and trp media are merging with digital world acquisition Corp I
8:28
remember people pinging me is this a joke because most people I'm sure had
8:33
never heard of digital world and even more people had no idea that Trump was even doing a social media company
8:40
because while all this is going on and they're trying to put a deal together the social media platform that will
8:47
become truth social hasn't even launched and it won't do so for months later huh
8:52
but there's trouble right away the Securities Exchange Commission comes in announces it's open an investigation
9:00
into how this deal came together looking into whether Digital World violated
9:06
securi laws by engaging in merger talks ahead of time which technically is in
9:12
kosher in the way spacks are supposed to work but this investigation just drags
9:17
on and on and on and it's going to delay everything so this is turning out to be
9:22
a pretty big mess very big mess it looks like this Deal's never going to happen
9:29
happen mhm and finally when they launched truth social in early
9:35
2022 it's a little bit of a joke it's like this sort of very early version of
9:42
Twitter when it's sort of clunky and how Cluny you you were on it yeah I actually
9:48
think I was one of the first people to get in which I thought was sort of funny because I said I was from the New York
9:54
Times they actually verified me ma there was very little traffic it was almost like you'd post something and like the
10:01
you could literally hear the Crick um Trump never posted for 3 months
10:07
Trump never posted on Truth social that three months exist for his and I remember writing a story and like you
10:13
couldn't get an answer from them why is he not posting perhaps because he has his own doubts and also it wasn't a
10:19
place no one was there I mean they had a few million users there's like a few million dollars in advertising on Truth
10:26
social a lot of them the equivalent of almost late night TV advertising that you would see it's losing tons of money
10:33
which is In fairness it's not unusual for a startup company to lose money but
10:38
it was not clear where it was ever going to make money and where the money was going to come in and we're looking at
10:46
this thing is it even going to happen your deal is in trouble because of regulators and also the company's in
10:53
trouble because there's just nothing there so everyone I think for the most
10:58
part of counts this thing out for them it was a desperate situation
11:06
mhm and then last summer a bunch of things started to go right all of a
11:12
sudden for Trump media and it really started to raise the
11:18
prospects that this deal actually could [Music]
11:27
happen we'll be right back [Music]
11:37
so about how is it that things start to turn around for this real mess of a
11:44
social media company that Donald Trump has founded okay so the single biggest
11:50
thing was Last Summer the SEC settles its investigation with digital world
11:56
with the spack that it was merging with MH and and that basically at that point sort of clears the gates for them to
12:03
start to really move forward with the merger what kind of settlement was it they had to pay $18 million and they had
12:10
to rewrite all their disclosures to make it consistent to reveal every all the
12:15
early talks they had had with Trump media got it the other thing is Elon
12:20
must buys Twitter now X and one of the first things he does is he says Trump
12:25
you can come back start posting again we want you we love you everyone thinks Trump's going to do that
12:31
but then he stays he continues to post on Truth
12:37
social and it's clear he's sticking with his own platform and if anything he
12:42
starts ramping up his postings on TR social and they become increasingly as
12:48
we know with the way Trump is bombastic inflammatory attacking all the judges
12:54
and all the cases going on the prosecutors political opponents and he's
12:59
been doing it with increasing frequency and this is a key ingredient of last Summer's turnaround cuz it's
13:06
clear at this point Trump is sticking with truth social he's not going anywhere he's leaning into it and it's
13:13
become his [Music]
13:18
platform but we shouldn't lose sight that maybe the most important thing is the Loyalty of shareholders and I'm not
13:26
talking about big hedge funds big institutions wealthy people I'm talking about ordinary Trump supporters many of
13:33
them who are posters on TR social and happen to be
13:38
stockholders of this cashr spack that's eventually going to merge with Trump
13:44
media and they're the ones who have kept this thing going to some degree as investors as investors because there
13:50
were many points where the spack deal itself could have just failed but they really want to make sure this company
13:58
succeeds it's almost like a a religious kind of thing for some of them and I can
14:04
tell you one guy's been very vocal is actually sort of a Christian minister good evening dwac stock he has his own
14:10
streaming video show on Rumble which he called dwac live named after the shares
14:16
Lord we ask in the name of Jesus that you help the executives finish this strong and that you protect them from all the forces that would try to stop
14:23
the merger and in their person where they talk about the stock and the merger and it's got his own following
14:29
just all show up at Mar Lago knock on the door and be like hey uh president Trump we'd like to come party with you
14:36
because uh we we all own little bits of your company and we love you let's just check on the price one more time before
14:42
we uh we head out for the night so in some way Trump really owes a lot to the
14:49
his small shareholders who made this possible cuz if it wasn't for them there
14:55
would be no merger and when they talk to you about why they have have bought
15:00
shares in this business in this spack even when it's at its least successful
15:06
and most imperil how do they talk about why it's worth their hard-earned money
15:13
first of all they view their building something and they've all believed that right or wrong whatever you may think
15:19
about it that truth social is free from censorship that allows Trump and others
15:24
to say what they want and they really believe that as like founding principles
15:30
they're the original owners essentially going to be of this company and they're helping it flourish and build so this
15:35
has become a real personal thing for a lot of them more so than I think I've
15:42
ever seen with any other publicly traded company before so the folks who are
15:49
investing in this spack anticipating it will eventually get together with truth
15:54
social and who as you have just said sustain this through its dark chapter
16:00
they aren't really there because they see this as a highly profitable business you just said Matt that it was losing
16:06
money they're doing it as a statement and I guess a measure of their fervor
16:13
for Trump for the movement he represents buying the stock is a way for them to
16:19
put their money where their mouth is when it comes to manga right right for them this is about supporting Trump and
16:27
supporting this company with which they view as critically important and keeping
16:32
its message out there alive so I think that more or less brings us to this week right when this turnaround you're
16:39
describing results in this crazy takeoff
16:45
of the stock price but just walk us through the mechanics of it what happened was there's the shareholder vote and the way it works is digital
16:52
world shareholders have to vote to approve the merger with Trump media it
16:57
was at this point it was a 4one conclusion but it's a vote so you never know what's going to happen though and they get the vote on Friday it's
17:03
overwhelming I think it was 29 million shares voted in favor and 200,000 voted
17:10
against I mean you just don't see that a landslide a landslide yes like electoral
17:16
Landslide so the deal goes through on Monday the deal is actually
17:25
closed and we have our first day of trading on Tuesday of this week ticker symbol DJ DJ Donald John Donald J Trump
17:34
former president Donald Trump's newly merged social media company has begun trading and shares are soaring it opens
17:40
for trading but around4 something dollar a share more than 6.5 million shares in
17:47
Trump media had changed Hands by 950 this morning they have to actually halt trading briefly because the volume the
17:55
level of trading is off the charts in the stock currently you take a look at where Shares are they're up about 40% at
18:02
one point it reaches $70 a share uh this is the highest profile back we've seen
18:07
in quite a while really I'd say ever Katie I mean and on the end of trading on Tuesday it closes around $60 or so MH
18:15
and that's how we get this 78 billion valuation for the company in the paper
18:22
gain of 5.6 billion for Trump for Trump but for now quote unquote djt is the
18:28
mother of all meme stocks with the stock up 32% up as much as 58% today hard to
18:36
disagree I just want to make sure I understand why this company is now valued so highly and I guess what I'm
18:41
really getting at is is there an actual business case for it given what folks in
18:47
your calling would describe as the fundamentals of the business or is this
18:54
just a measure of these Trump supporting investors deep affinity for him is this
19:02
basically a bubble or is there maybe a true Financial justification that can be
19:09
laid out here okay so if we go pure fundamentals it's crazy this company is
19:16
not a s or8 billion doll company it had $3.3 million in revenues for the first
19:22
nine months of last year it lost about $49 million yeah that is not the makings of an8 billion doll valuation no no no I
19:30
mean the one good thing it got going it got $300 million in cash from this merger not for Trump for the company so
19:37
that's good they can use that cash to go out and buy something bring in more people hire influencers on Truth social
19:44
but even then they have 10 million downloads of Truth social I mean Twitter
19:50
is what like hundreds of millions of users I sorry X has 100 millions of
19:55
users where's it going to go for that kind of growth just ify that but this is
20:01
what Wall Street is I mean you know we call them our meme stocks they're fantasy stocks they take on a life of
20:08
their own we had this during the pandemic with GameStop in AMC the shares
20:14
run up to ridiculous levels driven largely by retail investors and just to
20:19
remind people those were stocks where retail investors were buying shares it
20:24
felt like because they wanted to send a message large anti-establishment message
20:30
they were mad at a hedge fund that had shorted it in one case I remember they wanted to make a point they wanted to
20:35
Stick it to the Man right and also it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy it becomes a Mania then others sort of see
20:42
this and get in because you feel like if you keep buying it's never going to fall it's never going to go down and that can
20:50
work for a while but eventually gravity will always take hold at some part I'm
20:56
not saying that Trump media is going to collapse but at some point something
21:02
will happen that will trigger the stock to sell off right whether it's fragile it's fragile right it's not sustainable
21:09
at this level but when it's happening it's hard for me or anyone to give you a rational reason and that's why there's
21:16
this old thing IR rational exuberance it's not necessarily unusual
21:22
it's just that it's unusual because you have a very loyal investor base to him
21:28
personally that is driving a lot of these surges in the stock I'm really curious how Trump's
21:36
position in this presidential campaign factors into what you just described because it feels like this irrational
21:43
exuberance has to be linked somewhat to the reality that he is the now lead
21:49
candidate in the polls for reelection but I'm curious what investors think
21:55
about that how they link his chances of becoming president with the Financial Health and future
22:02
promise of this company it's definitely I think going to be a barometer sort of
22:07
trump in his political fortunes I mean just by way of example the spa stock
22:13
started to sore this year when Trump was on the verge of locking up the nomination it was around the time Des
22:19
santis dropped out right in New Hampshire the stock surged like 60 70%
22:25
overnight go was really because people think hey Trump is going to be the nominee and we're going to be going
22:30
forward but can you just explain that what does one have to do with the other in theory it doesn't have anything to do
22:36
with it but it's like a proxy for him okay it's also the idea that as long as
22:42
Trump is still politically viable Trump media is viable truth social is viable
22:48
and presumably a president 2.0 Trump is the best possible situation for this
22:55
stock price if he wins I think it probably will be a high watermark for the stock and I would just think given
23:01
the dynamic with the election right now it's hard to see the stock not continuing to rise at least until
23:08
November okay I want to turn now to Trump's access to this very valuable
23:15
stock at a time when as we all know he seems to need money how and when could
23:21
he tap into this money okay so at the moment he actually can't can he can't
23:28
there's what's called a lockup a restriction it's not just for him it's for any major shareholders they can't
23:35
sell for 6 months it's actually not unusual in these kind of circumstances
23:40
the logic is you don't want important people to the company important shareholders to bolt as soon as a deal
23:46
goes through but there are other ways he can get around that one way is for the
23:52
board it's a seven member board they're all loyalists for the most part they
23:58
could allow him to sell shares early I personally think that's unlikely because
24:03
it shows a lack of faith you know just like if he had jumped from trud social onto Twitter this would be the same kind
24:09
of message being sent got it what they could do is allow him to pledge those
24:15
shares meaning he can go out and get a loan use it as collateral the shares don't get sold but you're giving them to
24:22
some other like a bank or probably more likely a hedge fund so that would be a way for him to monetize
24:29
his stock without actually selling it so if Trump really wanted to he could find
24:35
a way working through this board of loyalists to tap into this money pretty
24:40
quickly if he so chose to if he asked the board to do it I think there's probably a good chance the board would
24:46
do it but if he doesn't really need the money that desperately I think he probably won't and I think the board
24:53
would be reluctant because it doesn't really help anyone to have lots of stock
24:58
coming out into the market that only will probably depress the price of the shares and it doesn't help to have the
25:04
face of the company the man whose initials are on the ticker selling the
25:09
stock because that suggests he doesn't have a tremendous amount of faith in the business and that might trigger a sell-off which would undermine the value
25:15
of the rest of his stock it's a pretty bad cycle to start it's a bad right that's like the event that starts to
25:21
send the sell off and even at that point even your most loyal shareholders may
25:26
say well I don't want to be left the last one holding in the back right I want to step way back for just a minute
25:33
and think about the larger meaning of what has happened with truth social I
25:38
mean I've covered a lot of Trump's businesses Through The Years investigated them when he was a candidate in 2016 and it really strikes
25:46
me that of all the businesses he's been in real estate casinos Trump University
25:53
selling Trump steaks Trump wine whatever you know those made money
25:59
this in some ways feels like the least Sound business of all and yet it has
26:07
made him the richest by far that's a little bit weird to wrap your head
26:12
around what is that tell you about the nature of trump and these investors who
26:20
believe in this it is weird I'm not a politics reporter but from a business
26:25
perspective this has given me a little bit better insight into his seemingly
26:31
unending kind of popularity and support there's the old adage on Wall
26:38
Street never fall in love with the stock but the reality is a lot of his shareholders here are in love with the
26:45
stock they have fall in love with it and they're in love with him to a large extent and when you have that sort of
26:51
mix there it allows a stock to soar to sort of unreal levels that we're seeing
26:59
now and who knows where it goes from here but for the moment it's clearly
27:05
working for Mr Trum well Mt thank you very much thank
27:11
you for having [Music]
27:17
me when the stock market closed on Wednesday afternoon shares of Trump's
27:22
New Media Company reached $66 a share up 14% % from the previous day as of this
27:31
morning the company is worth $9.4
27:39
billion we'll be right back here's what else you need to know
27:46
today authorities said that the six missing workers who were on the Francis Scott Key bridge when it collapsed are
27:53
now presumed dead the workers were members of a construction crew who were
27:59
repairing masonry and potholes when a massive container ship plowed into the
28:04
bridge on Tuesday morning this is no ordinary bridge this is one of the cathedrals of
28:10
American infrastructure experts say that rebuilding the bridge which carried 30,000 Vehicles a day will probably take
28:18
years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars a reality acknowledged by the
28:23
Secretary of Transportation Pete budic so the path to normal noraly will not be
28:29
easy it will not be quick it will not be inexpensive but we will rebuild
28:38
together and the first ever congestion pricing system in the United States
28:44
crossed a major Milestone on Wednesday when New York officially approved tolls
28:50
for cars driving through the busiest sections of Manhattan the system modeled
28:56
on those in London and Singapore is designed to significantly reduce traffic
29:02
and air pollution the tolls $15 for most Passenger cars and as much as $36 for
29:10
large trucks are expected to raise $1 billion a year for mass
29:15
transportation the new system could still be blocked by several lawsuits seeking to derail it but if those cases
29:22
fail the tools will begin in mid June
