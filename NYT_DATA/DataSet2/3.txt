What About the People Who Donâ€™t Vote?



0:06
hi my name is estad hearnen I'm a reporter with the New York Times I host the politics podcast the runup I was
0:11
looking for Kevin good thank you for picking up uh I'm calling because we are talking to people
0:16
who previously participated in times polling to ask them about how they're feeling about this year about the presidential election and maybe answer a
0:23
couple questions that we could use possibly on our podcast do you think you have maybe 5 10 minutes for us to chat
0:28
today friend let make sure this isn't a crazy machine it's not this is this is a real
0:35
reporter with the real New York Times who who uh uh would love to get your thoughts about the presidential election
0:41
all I got you but you got to say this for me you ready you go first okay say
0:50
pickles point in specifically at people people's Point
0:57
pickles Point specifically at people okay I respect it because there's a lot
1:04
of uh these these AI machines are getting a little fancy these days I I I get why you got to got to make sure can
1:10
you tell me a little bit about yourself what part of the country you're in uh what you do uh just help me learn a
1:15
little more about you uh shoot man well I live in
1:22
Delaware and I survive M uh how old are you 38 38 what one question we're asking
1:30
people is do they consider themselves political a Democrat a Republican and independent anything like that uh I'm be
1:38
honest with you I'm waiting for a politic to come up and actually like you
1:44
know make things really equal uhhuh instead of just you know everybody just
1:50
saying equality actually make it equal you're saying someone who doesn't talk
1:56
about equality but you feel like you trust to actually do something yeah have you voted previously do you
2:04
vote look at the options would you vote I I totally understand that part of
2:10
the reason we're calling people is to talk to people even who don't vote so I guess I'm just asking that not to in any
2:15
place of judgment but just to get a better sense about you excuse me no I dig it 100% I get it um so I just wanted
2:22
to ask in can you tell me have you ever voted in the presidential election have you ever felt inspired by a candidate and then actually and then went and do
2:27
it or you have you not voted consistently now I voted I voted for uh I voted for
2:35
Obama okay but it wasn't because he was black it was more
2:41
so I had HED that you know it was somebody that was gonna be in here actually like fix some [ __ ] yeah yeah so
2:51
part of the reason you haven't participated is because you feel like they're not speaking to the things that actually matter for your day
2:56
today exactly would you be more willing to Vote or participate in a political
3:01
system that you thought candidates did actually speak to things that do affect your day-to-day
3:08
life okay okay uh I just want to do this really quickly so that I have a clear
3:13
answer why won't you vote for Joe Biden in November I think Joe Biden needs to just
3:20
sit down you think Joe Biden needs to sit down yeah I think [ __ ] his old ass
3:26
there I won't vote for Joe Biden November because he look like he Snee
3:32
away from the ICU and why won't you vote for Donald Trump in
3:38
November because I don't know how true it is but
3:43
they talking about Donald Trump is about to take away punishing the
3:52
police and so for you the solution would just not be the vote at
3:58
all for me would be the option of voting for Snoop you putting Snoop like Snoop
4:06
Dog yes I'm curious though like why Snoop
4:11
you can write it anybody why why Snoop why not okay I guess that's a a
4:17
fair guess that's fair you get what I'm saying from The New York Times I'm a
4:22
stad hington this is the [Music]
4:27
runup this election cycle there's already been a lot of discussion of the non voter or people like
4:35
Kevin because this year huge numbers of Americans say they don't like their candidate options and the political
4:41
system that produced them so there are a lot of questions about whether this election will
4:47
ultimately be decided by the people who choose not to show up in 2016 there are about 100 million
4:55
eligible voters who opted out of the process in 2020 that number was closer
5:00
to 80 million but the reality is for all the talk about turnout numbers very little
5:08
attention is paid to who non-voters actually are and if anything can be learned from the reasons they don't
5:14
vote so I called up Anthony Williams who directed A major project on this subject
5:19
for the night Foundation ahead of the 2020 election every election cycle campaigns
5:26
from city council all the way up to president it's been told millions of dollars reaching out to and trying to
5:33
understand the perspectives of those who vote on a regular basis and so you end up getting the same opinions reinforce
5:39
over and over and over again and those opinions dominate the political conversation so our question in this
5:45
study was what does everybody else think when you consider that everybody else is about 100 million eligible voters to
5:52
help answer that question they surveyed 12,000 non voters across the country
5:58
people who they Define this way so we Define non voters as going back over um
6:04
six election Cycles so we took three presidential elections and three midterm
6:09
elections if somebody voted in one of those six elections they were still
6:14
eligible to participate in the survey because you know depending on the issue depending on the candidate even a
6:21
consistent non voter might occasionally show up if they voted in two or more elections they were out so that's how we
6:27
that's how we Define non-voters people who have voted in no more than one out of the last six major elections and or
6:33
those people who were eligible to to vote but weren't even registered you know I feel like there's some assumptions that people make about who
6:40
non-voters are that they don't follow the news maybe they lack an education a general belief that maybe politics
6:45
doesn't matter these are just kind of things we often hear about this group take me through some of the myths that
6:51
you think that your data might have shown some light to how did those myths line up to reality of the hundred
6:56
million eligible voters who don't participate that you all study well in terms of some of the rationale for why
7:02
they don't participate many of those sentiments were genuinely reflected in the research
7:08
that we did I guess the one big myth that we were able to dispel is there
7:13
there was a notion that this group was somehow monolithic all lowincome all
7:19
supporting one particular party or the other and that just wasn't the case um this is not a monolithic Group by any
7:26
stretch of the imagination and in fact when you look at it from a partisan land it's roughly a third a third and a third
7:32
between Democrats Republicans and independents so when you all research the non-voting population didn't break
7:38
down as if you know there was a a sleeping mass of Democrats or a bunch of Republicans who were untapped but you're
7:44
saying largely it broke down into Democrats Republicans Independence fairly equally split fairly equally
7:50
split now when you divide the the group further we also had the opportunity once we finished our primary analysis we took
7:58
it a step further and we found six subgroups within the non-voting
8:03
population H well take me through some of those six subgroups what were the specific groups that you found under the
8:09
umbrella of America's non-voters so we divided the group first into what we
8:14
considered plugged in and disconnected and by plugged in we meant paying attention to news generally
8:22
aware of issues that are taking place cuz there's also this perception that non-voters just don't know mhm well
8:29
that's true for some non-voters but many non-voters engage in some of the same
8:34
behaviors in terms of information consumption as people who do participate so on the plugged in end of the
8:41
perspective you have one subgroup that's established progressives tend to lean a little bit more toward Democratic
8:47
candidates and policies a a traditional conservative cohort which tends to be
8:53
older male and more Republican leaning and then a modern moderate which is sort
8:58
of in between how would we Define a modern moderate that's the one I think I have the most questions on the key
9:05
attitudes with that group is really when it comes down to political viewpoints on
9:11
issues right uh so among that moderate group is a belief that the issues they
9:17
may go back and forth they may agree with Democrats on a particular issue they may agree with Republicans on
9:23
particular issue and that subgroup may actually be more open to considering third- party candidates over over either
9:29
of the two major parties they also tend to be younger than the average non-voter and are the
9:36
most ethnically diversed among the plugged in non-voting population okay so what about the
9:43
disconnected groups that you all found how would we break them down more clearly so you have sort of an indifferent average an unattached
9:52
apolitical and an underemployed and unsure um okay I'm going to need definitions on all of those AB
9:58
absolutely so the indifferent average was specifically people who had a mix of
10:04
political views and they are united by members of that group lacking interest
10:09
in news or following political current events right so this is kind of step one
10:16
on the in on the unplugged side the disengaged side okay so they might be
10:21
the they they might have a general maybe some understanding of issues or or things happening but they're definitely
10:27
not actively following it exactly right got it what about the unattached apolitical you also set that group right
10:33
that is actually where a lot of the younger people on average are and generally have lower educational
10:40
attainment and lower household income on average the majority of this group is
10:45
unmarried and they are also most likely to have moved within the last few years and so what you're looking at there is
10:51
just kind of an an instability perhaps these people later on in life once they become rooted might
10:58
participate but at this stage in their lives there's too much instability in
11:04
their own daytoday for them to even care to research to I hear I hear how this
11:09
could affect some my V even if we think about registration knowing where to go knowing the type of issues knowing the
11:15
candidates who are on the ballot if you're someone who has a more kind of unstable life if you're moving more
11:21
often if you've just got bigger stuff going on in your daytoday survival I I I
11:27
can see how politics seems a little far field absolutely now ironically it's
11:32
those people for whom politics is probably the most important because policy decisions impact those who are
11:39
most vulnerable most directly so the fact that they don't have the time or
11:44
the interest to engage is likely in many ways to their detriment what we find and
11:53
I I I guess this is not unique to the United States nor unique to our current uh situ ation in politics but squeaky
12:01
wheel gets the grease those people who are engaged in the voting process typically are those who are more likely
12:08
to get policy that they agree with pass and so those people who are disengaged
12:14
largely on the notion that government doesn't really work for them that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy you
12:20
know politicians are like people who work in any other industry they respond
12:26
to the customers that they see in front of them and the complaints or suggestions that they hear most
12:32
frequently what about the last group you mentioned about the more disconnected group of non-voters the underemployed
12:38
unsur I think you called them and how is that different than maybe people who are apolitical or people who are you know
12:44
the in different group you talked about uh pre more previously well for this group there is the additional uh
12:51
challenge of there being something of a financial impediment this group is
12:57
characterized by having of all groups the lowest educational attainment the lowest home ownership rate lowest
13:03
marriage rate least full-time employment and lowest household income uh this group is also overwhelmingly female and
13:12
those females are typically single head of households raising children and so you can see where the demands of Life
13:21
yeah get in the way of participation in politics yeah I mean you got mouths to
13:26
feed who cares about this little election exactly exactly and neither of these candidates is going to help me
13:31
feed these miles so I don't care I think when we talk about non voters we sometimes assume like a disconnected
13:38
person of color you mentioned traditional conservatives were group that trended older white male is that an
13:43
outlier how much can we have a racial breakdown of non-voting population well
13:49
in the same way that you can't really apply the socioeconomic or education lens to the entire group you can't
13:55
really apply the racial lens either um overall they're very much a reflection
14:01
of the body politic of the country but again as you look at particular subgroups you're going to see more or
14:06
less got it of a particular group so among that traditional conservative group that's overwhelmingly male
14:14
overwhelmingly white overwhelmingly older the typical person who when we ask
14:20
them about their media consumption would say that they are following certain websites they're watching Fox News Etc
14:26
very much like any other conservative would mhm they're just not voting they're just not voting yeah the report lays out several
14:33
main takeaways from the data can you take me through the takeaways and then I have a question from that I think sure
14:38
thing so in terms of General takeaways what we found is that non-voters first
14:45
of all are not for the most part embarrassed and
14:50
because that was one of the things that we were concerned about going into this research would you get answers uh that
14:57
were kind of uh responding saying what they thought you wanted to hear or would they be honest and what we found is that
15:03
most people were not embarrassed or ashamed at all to tell you that they don't vote and we're happy to tell you
15:09
all the reasons why not interesting did that surprise you it did you know we we
15:16
thought that there might be some you know the the American ethos of participatory democracy is is so
15:23
ingrained in popular culture but that we thought there might be some shame in
15:29
people not participating and that couldn't have been further from the truth people were
15:34
as candid as you could possibly believe and would basically tell you either I don't like politics I'm not interested
15:41
in politics or I don't trust politics I don't like politics I'm not
15:47
interested in politics or I don't trust politics and in many cases all the above what some
15:53
more um cuz there's one I'm particularly interested maybe I'll read it to you it it the emerging Cate is even less
15:59
informed and less interested in politics uh can you tell me more about that absolutely so one of the things that we
16:05
did as part of the survey is we wanted to have a specific comparison frame
16:11
among young people okay and so we did what's called an over sample over and above the 12,000 interviews that we did
16:18
with everybody we did a th000 interviews just among people between 18 and 24 and asked them the same series of
16:25
questions and what we found is that there's a pretty significant drop off in
16:32
news viewership Civic engagement interest in politics all of
16:37
the things that might lead somebody to voting or not voting there was a significant drop off obviously between voters and non-voters and then that drop
16:45
off is even more dramatic between the general voter and young people okay okay
16:52
should I take that as like having been true generally about young people less interested in news what or is this a
16:58
particular uh thing or moment or or is there something happening among kind of news
17:04
consumption and young people do you think young people have always been generally less engaged in the political
17:10
process but this is deeper than just disengagement the
17:17
distrust among younger voters and the belief that politics and government just
17:22
fundamentally doesn't react to them is so ingrained that it it it's difficult
17:29
to even engage in a conversation about why voting is important because there for
17:36
many of these folks in the younger cohort who don't vote they don't see any
17:42
evidence of a connection between the political process and their day-to-day
17:47
lives you know for for other groups as they get older and take on responsibilities and you have kids and
17:53
you buy a house and you do those things those behaviors then tend to push you
17:59
towards participation in the political system this is a group of people that
18:06
I'm not 100% sure it's going to be as easy even as they even as they mature
18:12
the distrust disinterest uh in the system is so profound they're bored by
18:17
it or they're frustrated by it there's just a lot of people who don't want to be involved with it don't want to hear
18:23
anything about it is any of this candidate specific Donald Trump is someone who has kind of himself on
18:29
bringing new people into the in into the kind of voting population you know
18:34
activating people who weren't interested in politics before I've talked to people who have voted for Biden and democrats
18:40
for the first time partially because their fear of the other side in unique ways how much does the candidate matter
18:47
and do we have any evidence that any candidate motivates non voters more than any other um candidates definitely
18:53
matter but they matter at the margins uh for example 2008 the first Obama uh
19:00
campaign you saw an uptick in overall participation and particularly an uptick
19:06
among some of these younger groups of people that traditionally don't
19:11
participate in voting there was a significant uptick in the 2020 election
19:16
on both sides um to your point Donald Trump was certainly motivational um
19:22
probably as motivational for more Biden voters to show up than they were uh
19:27
Trump voters even though Republican vote also went up pretty significantly between 16 and 20 beyond
19:34
that if we're waiting for the perfect candidate to have an impact on voter turnout that's going to happen once in a
19:42
while either you're going to have a particularly good candidate that turns people on or you're going to have a particularly scary candidate that turns
19:48
people off and this could be Democrat Republican independent um across the
19:54
political Spectrum those shifts are temporary and
20:00
and elusory um I I if if I can use that term you're you're saying those shifts
20:06
are temporary but what you're talking about is like a larger and more sustainable tide raise of voting that
20:12
only comes with kind of addressing these more structural and long-standing beliefs exactly exactly a particular
20:19
good or a bad candidate will move things a percentage or a few percentages at the margins but what we're trying to focus
20:26
on in this particular study and we hope that elected officials and um activists
20:31
in the political space will take seriously are these fundamental chips in
20:38
the in the strength of American democracy it's it's it's hard to con to convince people to vote if they don't
20:45
believe fundamentally that their vote is going to matter or change anything and the trend lines are are concerning can
20:52
we apply some of this to this year I Know This research was done after 2016 and going into 2020 but you need thing
20:58
of course about 24 is that we very likely are going to have the same two candidates on the top of the ticket again when you think about this research
21:05
and the themes that you all were're seeing at that time I mean anecdotally I feel like a lot of a lot of the people
21:11
we talk to now seem to greater and greater reflect some of the sentiments that you were sharing before what's your
21:17
sense about what applies to now that you learned then the sense that I get is
21:23
that these were significant but somewhat below the the radar sentiments and what
21:30
we're seeing now as kind of a general disillusionment postco um the all of the challenges that
21:37
we've had with with the functioning of our federal government believe it or not many voters are starting to now mimic
21:45
the same types of disillusionment but they're also mimicking the same fear of the other
21:52
that we saw in the 2020 election so Republicans are just as sure that by
21:58
Biden and the Democrats are the end of democracy as Democrats are sure that
22:03
Trump and the Republicans are the end of democracy so that's either going to lead more people to check out or it's going
22:10
to drive more people to vote just out of fear not really out of support for either of these people two feelings can
22:16
exist alongside one another the feelings of apathy and disillusionment that I think you all were tracking here that
22:22
seems to have grown among a general voting population could lead some to not participate but at the same time you're saying the fear and the kind of the the
22:30
the fear of the other side that was so deeply rooted in 2020 is still here and that's also going to have its effect
22:35
these two things are kind of In conflict with one another I mean your belief that the system's not working as opposed to
22:43
your kind of hatred for the other person at war with one another right and what
22:49
we see here is that particularly among these folks who are not particularly political to begin with and don't really
22:55
lean towards either party as the nature of the debates become more and more
23:01
fiercely partisan more and more of those people are likely to check out got it
23:08
there's a huge incentive here for both parties to turn these possible non-voters into voters obviously and
23:13
that gives them a big Advantage but what we see is that among the non- voting populations that you have helped us
23:19
understand there it's more likely that the engaged kind of people who are withholding their vote but follow
23:25
politics move into the voter bucket then the folks who are more disengaged don't
23:32
follow news have other stuff in their lives going on in which this political environment you're suspecting puts them even further away right and for for
23:41
those people who are interested in growing the pie of civic
23:47
participation um this is not the ideal um atmosphere for that you know not non
23:55
voting is often treated as this like very illogical Act like who could do this why would they not see that this
24:01
matters I'm curious after all your research like how do you see it do you understand why these people don't do it
24:08
or do you kind of still have that sense of like it does affect you so while I
24:15
understand the barriers there could be they could be overcome I I'll answer the question this way from my own personal
24:22
perspective um I guess you could say that I have been engaged in some form of government
24:29
ever since student council in kindergarten and so
24:34
personally I would never not vote but what this research
24:41
taught me definitively is that this is not an irrational group of people right they
24:48
have made a rational determination that them taking the time
24:54
to participate in this system is for whatever reason not worth it to them if
25:00
we were to look ahead to November do you have any clues for us or or or if you
25:05
were to look at the six groups that you laid out of non-voters if if there was a
25:11
group that you think might have the biggest effect on um on the question of
25:18
who might win or maybe maybe the most movable group for the parties to Target
25:23
who would that be the subgroup that I would look at most this cycle the modern
25:29
moderates that yeah who are engaged and knowledgeable but don't feel a
25:35
particular Affinity to either side I think is going to be a group of people to whom both political parties should
25:41
pay attention it could be determinative the number of true
25:47
Independents is relatively small and so there there's not a whole lot of places for the two political parties or the
25:52
presidential campaigns to go for New support and I suspect that the closest
25:58
this race is especially in the tightly contested swing States they're going to reach further and further into this
26:04
group of people who don't traditionally participate this is really helpful because the number of persuadable
26:10
partisans is smaller and smaller and smaller it does seem to give a greater importance to the type of people who
26:17
exist outside of that space and are the non-voting populations that often go
26:23
ignore exactly it it would be my recommendation my sentiment based on
26:30
the research that we've done that either party that does not participate in
26:36
outreaching to these groups in this particular U landscape is probably
26:43
making a mistake because there isn't anybody else well thank you this was really helpful I appreciate your time
26:48
and thanks for helping us out my pleasure take care so according to Anthony the most
26:55
movable group of non-voters are people who are engaged in politics but for whatever reason are inconsistent when it
27:03
comes to showing up to vote after the break we hear from some of this group who could potentially be
27:09
the deciders come [Music] November so Anthony was focused on
27:16
non-voters broadly and particularly chronic non-voters or people who rarely
27:22
participate in presidential elections at all but when it comes to who's going to win in November the most important group
27:29
of non-voters are likely the ones who are more persuadable and are open to voting depending on the circumstances
27:36
the candidates and their message with that in mind we asked the New York Times
27:42
polling team for a list of people who had not voted in 2020 but we're still deciding about
27:48
2024 and we called some of them up to see what if anything was shaping their
27:56
decision hello hello my name is EST sted hearen I was calling looking for James
28:02
Simonson you got him oh I appreciate that thank you for picking up we really appreciate your time um can you just
28:08
tell me a little bit about yourself what part of the country are you in how old are you what do you do things like that
28:13
hi I'm uh 59 years old I'm in Indianapolis Indiana and I work in high
28:20
Precision tooling so kind of a tech industry thing I um am curious are you someone who identifies as a Democrat
28:28
Republican independent anything like that I really don't identify anymore I used to be a republican but uh the
28:36
Republican Party seems to be going away from my values or I'm going away from
28:41
theirs so can you Democrats are too far to the left so I'm probably an
28:46
independent now okay so are we talking about kind of Donald Trump's Republican party yeah I voted for Donald Trump the
28:53
first time around I thought it would be good to shake up things in Washington and and did do that but there's no way I
29:00
can vote for that guy again it's uh he's he's crazy are you someone who usually
29:05
votes in presidential elections were you abstaining from voting in 2020 or yeah I was abstaining I I usually vote but I
29:11
was abstaining did you vote down ballot it was it just an AB abstaining from the
29:17
presidential race no I just I just abstained from voting I didn't bother got it in Indiana if you at least in in
29:25
for State elections and for you're going you know it's going to be a republican in this state there's just
29:32
pointless to think that a Democrat can win you know that's just a waste of time and you know I'm actually thinking
29:38
pretty hard if depending on who the Democrats put up which is probably going to be Biden um I might I might be forced
29:45
to vote for him just because he's a known entity and I he's more predictable
29:51
than Donald Trump that's what I was going to ask about you abstained in 2020
29:57
we're very like to have those same two candidates again but you might vote this time I might vote because recognizing
30:05
how crazy and dangerous Donald Trump really is I'm no fan of Biden but uh you
30:11
know Biden I don't really think is is doing a lot of the decision- making anyway there's people behind him that
30:16
are doing the policy and making decisions and and running the country I think he's more of a
30:22
figurehead you know his age does trouble me and he he seems to be frail and you
30:28
know his mental acuity is an issue so but that's okay there's other people around him that are helping him make
30:34
decisions this was so helpful I really appreciate your time I appreciate this conversation you're welcome you have a
30:39
good day yeah you too have a great
30:47
day hello my name is ested hearon I'm a reporter with the New York Times I was looking for Kristen love this is hi
30:54
thank you for picking up um what part of the country are you in can you tell me a little bit about yourself I am in
31:01
Colorado I'm in the St Louis Valley which is a pretty rural area um how old are you
31:09
39 are you someone who consider yourself a a Democrat a Republican or independent
31:14
or anything like that um I'm non-political what do you mean by that I
31:21
honestly think that our politics are kind of crap to put it bluntly and if
31:27
it's not like directly relevant in like a local politics I try not to get too involved
31:35
it's a very capitalist patriarchal society and you
31:40
know I want to talk more about that actually I mean have you voted in presidential
31:46
elections I have before yes what about the last one did you vote in 2020 no okay so did you kind of drop off
31:54
a voting in presidential elections or is it just depends on which one means whe whether you participate or
32:01
not um if there was a woman that ran I'd probably vote for a woman but as it is
32:07
now it really doesn't make much of a difference how you vote I think the same things are going to happen regardless of
32:13
who a president is did you vote back in 2016 when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic
32:20
nominee um yes okay so you're saying if there was a candidate that's particularly spoke to you you felt
32:26
inspired by or you know shared an identity with that would make you more likely to vote it would but I mean it
32:33
would also depend on what some of the issues are and everything but as it is
32:38
yeah there's I doubt that's going to happen anytime soon I'm curious like do
32:44
you consider your withholding of a vote or your decision not to vote as a protest or a message to that system that
32:51
you don't really like or is it just because you don't want to do it and it's just more of a matter of convenience or something like that I think it kind of
32:59
stems from my cynicism as you know learning more about the way things are actually run and who's behind stuff and
33:06
whether our vote really matters you know it's just kind of the cynical attitude that I've
33:11
developed that I just I'm not going to waste my time doing it because it's not doesn't really matter do you plan to
33:17
vote this year no no not really I'm giving you some time to think about it what what goes
33:24
into that decision why why not I know it's because of the things you just said but specific to this year you're already
33:30
feel pretty confident you won't end up voting I don't know I guess maybe if
33:35
Trump actually ends up on a ballot I go just to vote against him interesting
33:41
interesting as for whether I think it really matters I don't think it really matters well okay is there anything Joe
33:48
Biden Could Do Or democrats could do to turn you from someone who probably won't vote to someone who will vote this year
33:55
yeah put a minority woman in isn't the vice president a minority
34:02
woman Yeah the more they can put take away middleaged white men out of our
34:08
faces of power then I probably would consider voting but I'm sorry her current status
34:15
as number two the running mate to Joe Biden is not enough for you I just want to be
34:20
clear no it's not enough okay okay well it's going to be interesting I'll be
34:26
curious to see what you end up doing in November considering that for a lot of the Biden hopes they hope that you know
34:32
maybe if you're not excited about him or or or or the Democrats on the ticket that you would come out to vote against
34:38
Trump and you're saying that you that could be a possibility for you that could be a possibility okay okay well
34:44
thank you I appreciate your time all right thank you so much have a great day you too there was one more person I
34:51
wanted to talk to someone who roded into the show last year who said for the first time in her life she was
34:58
considering not voting at all so um well I live in New York I've been living in
35:03
New York for a while now um it's going on 20 years I guess I consider myself
35:08
afro Puerto Rican I'm Puerto Rican by ethnicity um and then I'm on the the you
35:15
know more African um presenting uh side of that and how old do you what do you
35:21
do now so I'm I'm I'm 41 and um I just a transition careers
35:30
actually for a while I was in the Arts and entertainment industry and then I moved
35:35
into um Arts education and just recently I um transitioned into case management
35:42
at a community college Arlene was upset about the administration's policy in
35:47
Gaza and we spoke to her in late December what what would you say is like your um do you consider yourself a how
35:55
have you considered yourself a Democrat a Republican there something in
36:00
between yeah I mean I guess Loosely a Democrat and
36:06
that's only because those are like that's kind of the box that I need to to check on yeah on the form um but I've
36:14
always been registered as a Democrat um and and I consider myself
36:20
more sort of progressive leaning than I guess you could say the stereotypical
36:25
Democrat might be mhm mhm are you someone who has historically voted in presidential
36:32
elections always always and for you like what's been the biggest Factor that's
36:38
gone into that vote I just believe have always believed really strongly in a citizen's duty to
36:46
vote I mean you know like the the Civil Rights images have always been like
36:52
really seared into my mind you said that you're considering sitting out the election
36:58
yeah my last kind of question here is like we talked to the Biden campaign uh a couple months ago and
37:04
their sense was that come November 2024 that the reality of Donald Trump or
37:10
another Republican winning or the way that voters have
37:17
traditionally placed foreign policy concerns under other concerns like the economy or things happening domestically
37:23
would make it such that people like you even with how they might feel feel about Joe Biden right now might be ready to
37:30
come back around come November I guess I'm wondering what you think about that premise look I'm a rational person and I
37:37
recognize how that may be true that could be the case I also feel like it's a
37:43
miscalculation I think it's lazy and it feels insulting because it means that
37:48
they're not listening you're supposed to be representing me and you're not listening
37:55
then where does that where does that leave me does that mean I should keep supporting you you're not listening
38:02
that's what I feel about it so with our focus on non-voters this week I decided
38:08
to call Arlene back is this
38:14
Arlene it is I um I know we talked before but I'm glad to be able to
38:20
reconnect because partially we're doing something specifically focused on people
38:25
who kind of have an open question about whether the vter not and that got us thinking about the conversation we previously had um can you just talk to
38:31
me about um how you are thinking about voting this year and how that's changed from kind of where you were
38:38
previously yeah um this year for the first time uh towards the you know in
38:44
the fall of last year 2023 for the first time I questioned
38:50
whether or not I've felt comfortable participating in the process which was a
38:56
real sort of I mean definitely a shift but it also kind of shook something in
39:02
me I think even just to consider that because I've been so deeply committed to it and just really believed in the act
39:09
of voting in a democracy I'm wondering how you feel now in relationship to how you felt last
39:16
fall there's a shift you know it's interesting because the last time that we spoke one of the uh things I remember
39:23
he saying was that the administration's bet that they're making is that eventually people will sort of
39:32
um remember the existential threat that a potential Trump uh another potential
39:39
Trump presidency could pose and that once they realize that then they'll you know go ahead and vote for for for the
39:47
president again for Biden again and Democrats across the board um and you
39:52
know quite frankly as the election has come closer um the steps that the
39:58
administration is taking the resolution in the UN but more importantly um Trump cinching the
40:07
Republican nomination which I you know still had hopes for in December that he wouldn't so like there is this looming
40:15
danger and I do believe that a trump presidency would be more dangerous a lot
40:22
more oh my God so much more than a Biden presidency I've never been a single
40:27
issue V voter before I never have it just like what happened in the fall it
40:32
felt like such a moral dilemma you know and um and now you
40:42
know the the compromise the feeling of of being willing to compromise is coming
40:47
back but you know it it it does not it feels worse than it's ever felt before I
40:54
I want to just be clear you think if the election was today you probably would vote for
41:08
Biden I I would I'm closer to voting for Biden than I was when we spoke in
41:14
December okay and that's because of the shift in position but also the reality
41:20
of Donald the prospect of Donald Trump's return has become more tangible and you
41:26
do feel that looming over your decision more absolutely yeah yeah and it you
41:33
know it's like I you know damn the bet that the administration made is is gonna I hate to be a part of that statistic
41:40
you know you hate that they pegged you right yeah I I really really
41:47
do um yeah I I I I do but the threat from
41:52
the other side just it's it's a lot bigger uh I I appreciate you uh check back in with us and if something changes
42:00
over these next several months specifically to this question about you voting feel free to let us know because
42:06
I would be interested to see if you know you're right that this is kind of a a
42:12
kind of set feeling that you're going to stick at with now or maybe something comes back up specific to Gaz or another
42:18
issue that returns you back to the same place so keep us in touch we'll do we'll
42:26
do I hate to say it but after spending this week thinking about non voters I kind of
42:33
understand why the parties don't focus on them many aren't plugged into politics avoid the news intentionally
42:40
and have deep-seated problems with the political system that won't be solved overnight but at the same time there's a
42:48
lot to be learned from this group and especially the people who are wavering in real
42:53
time because what I heard from voters like James and arene is a sentiment I often hear from the
43:00
Biden campaign itself that the closer we get to November the more tangible the
43:05
threat of trump will become so no matter Biden's political weaknesses which may dominate the race
43:12
right now nothing unites people more than a shared [Music]

enemy
