0:08
politics reporter at the New York Times

0:12
the times I'm looking for Belinda uh is
0:16
this
0:17
her it is thank you for picking up we
0:21
were hoping that you had maybe five 10
0:23
minutes today for us to ask a few
0:25
questions about how you're feeling about
0:26
politics right now and then record that
0:29
is that something you think we could do
0:31
right now okay we can try it I I don't
0:34
read the Times it's way too liberal for
0:37
me I'm not expecting a whole lot from
0:39
this conversation but I'll give it a
0:41
shot
0:43
okay in a typical year President Biden's
0:46
approval rating hitting a new record low
0:49
the midterm elections are a referendum
0:51
on the party in power President Biden's
0:53
overall and economic approval numbers
0:56
Plumbing depths not seen during his
0:58
presidency or any of the prior to
1:00
president 60% of Americans say they
1:03
disapprove of the job the president's
1:05
doing but this year it's not just a low
1:07
approval rating things feel different
1:09
numbers show that many Americans share a
1:11
somber outlook on the state of our
1:13
nation 56% of people pulled 71% of 85%
1:17
of Americans 85% say they are
1:20
dissatisfied with how things are going
1:23
regardless of political party and what
1:25
happens in November won't just be about
1:28
Joe Biden I have very little hope for
1:30
the future of the country nothing in
1:32
this country here really gives me hope
1:34
it'll be about something bigger
1:36
democracy is being eroded our democratic
1:38
system is under direct threat democracy
1:41
is much more fragile than I
1:43

1:50
Destruction this is a political moment
1:52
unlike any other tonight concerns and
1:55
frustrations over the Integrity of our
1:57

2:05
for governor the 2022 fall election will

2:10
