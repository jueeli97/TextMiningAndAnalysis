Will ‘Cease-Fire Now’ Drown Out ‘Biden 2024’?



0:02
so in the last month just as former president Trump has been racking up primary wins in Iowa and New Hampshire
0:10
something else has been happening on the Democratic side thank you President Biden has
0:18
slowly but surely started to activate campaign month thank you it's going to
0:24
go to my head on the trail right now he's particularly focused on Shing up his
0:30
standing with black voters you know uh and on South Carolina which holds the
0:35
first official Democratic primary contest this weekend point is that I've been blessed to worship here before as
0:42
well one of his first campaign events of 2024 was at mother Emanuel am Church in
0:48
Charleston the word of God was pierced by bullets and hate rage in his speech
0:53
that day Biden spoke about the dangers of white supremacy not just gunpowder
0:58
but by a poison poison us for too long haunted this nation and the setting was no accident
1:06
considering mother amanuel is the place where nine churchgoers all black were murdered by a white supremacist in
1:14
2015 from that day this nation saw this congregation this community demonstrate
1:22
one of the greatest acts of strength I have ever seen but a few minutes into his speech the truth is under assault in
1:29
America as a consequence so is our freedom our democracy our very country because
1:36
without the truth there's no light without light there's no path from this
1:42
Darkness if you really care about the lives lost here you should the
1:48
call he was [Applause] interrupted by protesters calling for a
1:54
ceasefire in Gaza that's all right that's all right the rest of the crowd started chanting in supportive Biden as
2:02
the protesters were escorted out of the [Music] [Applause]
2:10
event and since that interruption in Charleston over 25,000 Palestinians have
2:17
been murdered he fire now it feels like no matter where Biden or vice president
2:22
kamla Harris go have a lot of very important issues that we all must discuss the topic for this discussion
2:31
they can't speak without the word ceasefire being spoken back to or over
2:37
them today an incumbent president focused on reelection in November versus
2:44
a growing group of protesters who couldn't care
2:49
less from The New York Times I'm aad hearon this is the
2:58
runup hey can you hear me yes hi how are you all I'm good how are you uh I'm
3:05
doing okay uh I appreciate you taking some time out to chat with us earlier this week I spoke with two of the
3:12
protesters from the mother Emanuel event so my name Marx McDonald I'm lead organizer of Charleston black lives
3:18
matter from Columbia South Carolina originally and I'm Tamara I am an
3:24
organizer for free Palestine Charleston and a collaborator with Charleston black lives matter is a Palestinian amican and
3:32
I have been educated on this topic my entire life Marcus grew up in the mother Emanuel community and when he found out
3:39
Biden was coming to speak at the church he found it offensive I found it really
3:44
disrespectful when white po particularly abuse and weaponize the
3:50
massacre of mother manual against black people and against things that black people are fighting for so for V to come
3:56
here with blood on his hands that's why okay boom we have to organize initially Marcus was supposed to speak we knew
4:03
that we were kind of stepping into a black space and we didn't want to disrespect that or step on any toes but
4:10
says he was barred from entering the church that day Tamara spoke instead but they were Marcus's words and the entire
4:17
organization was initially supposed to be behind Marcus and stand in solidarity with him as a member of the mother
4:23
Emanuel community and in videos from the protest you can hear her interrupt the president
4:30
I thought that my words were incredibly clear I told him that if you really care about the lives lost here then you
4:37
should honor the lives lost and call for a ceasefire in Palestine we will not
4:42
allow him to come into our space and sort of campaign and politically profit off of a massacre that happened here in
4:49
Charleston while funding another Massacre that's happening in another holy city as a non-black person you
4:55
mentioned the the space and the kind of how you were trying to think about being uh respectful I'm saying considering
5:01
that you ended up having to be the one who spoke was there any fear that your words would be taken differently as
5:06
someone who isn't black I wouldn't necessarily say worried but because I was only speaking out
5:13
against Biden um I was hoping that respectability politics wouldn't play
5:19
such a huge role in this because I was speaking out against the president especially when we're talking about such a big humanitarian crisis and when we
5:27
were organizing we had me members of the black community and we had ask them what
5:34
is the best plan of action for this to happen and they reassured me that even
5:40
though you are not black and you are going to be speaking in a black space black people stand in solidarity
5:47
with Palestinians because the black struggle and the Palestinian struggle are intertwined and that sort of gave me the
5:54
confidence that I need to speak in the space when I saw the action take take
5:59
place I also immediately saw the kind of political conversation and backlash that came after it uh people trying to make
6:06
points about it being disrespectful as we talked about before uh people talking about um whether this was representative
6:13
of a larger Community I mean it felt intense at least from afar how was the reaction immediately once the protest
6:20
took place and how has that reaction developed so I think that that question
6:27
actually is very important to sort of the egocentrism that exists within American
6:33
politics because my stance that day wasn't about respectability politics and
6:39
it wasn't even about campaigns or politics or Republican versus Democrat this is a humanitarian crisis that
6:45
transcends any sort of dichotomy or American politics here that fact that
6:50
people were talking about that after my stance more than it was about the words that I was speaking and calling for a
6:56
ceasefire nobody was asking the question why is she calling for a ceasefire nobody was leading with why did she take
7:03
the stance to interrupt Biden in a black space and call for a ceasefire one of
7:11
the reasons I wanted to talk to you all is because while your action might not be focused on electoral politics
7:16
certainly this theme has become and entered the Electoral political Arena Biden has been interrupted at several
7:22
campaign events uh that started with Mother Emanuel there's a larger question about young people in this election and
7:28
how they about Biden specifically driven by the crisis in Gaza so I guess I'm saying
7:36
when you all take your protest actions are you thinking about any of that electoral politics impact or is it just
7:42
getting the substance of the message out there I think that again I just wanted to reiterate that there is an
7:48
egocentrism with sort of kind of like centralizing the Democrat versus Republican race in our like any sort of
7:56
political conversation or topic again this isn't a Republican versus a democratic issue nor is it a tactic to
8:04
be used as a sort of way to Garner votes in the upcoming election this is a
8:09
humanitarian crisis and over 25,000 people now have died so our
8:16
stance needs to be taken exactly like that it's not lightly
8:21
and it's not supposed to be used as a tactic to be talk about the upcoming election I totally understand that we're
8:28
working from different position here like I guess I'm asking because part of the effort in talking to you is
8:33
understanding the relationship between protest actions and electoral politics but you're free to reject the premise as
8:38
you have I was looking at The List of Demands that you all uh put out recently
8:43
and one thing that stuck out to me is that while the calls for a ceasefire are certainly Central into what you said in
8:49
the church that The List of Demands go far beyond just for biding the Cs for ceasefire it includes things like uh an
8:57
end to the normalization of Zionism and violence against Palestinians in every aspect of their lives including but not
9:02
limited to Media narratives institutional support and government backing if Joe Biden were to call for a ceasefire I guess I'm asking you like if
9:10
Joe Biden were to do it which obviously he hasn't that's the core of the call your message would that be enough for
9:15
y'all well I mean calling for a ceasefire is a minimum and he's not even giving us that asking asking the
9:22
president to stop funding a genocide is a minimum asking to allow Aid into a country that has 2 million people
9:30
displaced with their homes being bombed constantly is a minimum asking to stop using the use of illegal phosphorus gas
9:37
is a minimum so all of these things are basic levels of human decency and things
9:43
that we should be doing as a minimum and that's not even something that we are doing as a country of the United States
9:50
because we have gotten so normalized with the idea of dehumanizing Palestinians and the way we talk about
9:55
Middle East and Palestine in general one thing that kind of strikes me anecdotally is like a difference in the
10:02
way that activism has treated electoral politics in the last like five8 years right I remember talking the kind of
10:08
like black lives matter protest or activism at the earlier stages and there was much closer connection between uh uh
10:14
their own actions and Progressive wings of the democratic party then there seem to be in what you all are telling me on
10:20
this issue here I guess I'm saying forget like Joe Biden whatever in your own space of organizing and activism how
10:26
has that changed in the last 10 years has the relationship to electoral politics in General changed in your time
10:33
I think it is indicative of how far right the Democratic party is gone and
10:38
Centrist after 2020 I remember as I was getting the organizer being in the scene
10:43
a lot of the you know Democrats and liberal people were so G Home Supportive BLM and the work we're doing and then we
10:49
started doing our abolition work we started doing our like more Mutua and like like Central things to hold these
10:55
institutions accountable a lot of times those people who are more Centrist within the Democratic party abandon us
11:01
not only on that issue but a lot of issues with the stop cop City issue in Atlanta with a lot of De gentrification
11:06
issues going on here we've seen it's more of a fault I feel like of the party as a whole um indicative of where the
11:13
party as a whole is shifted to the right abandoned humanitarian politics in general so you're saying from what I
11:19
hear you're saying the Democrats left y'all you don't think it's not your relationship to electoral politics has
11:24
changed it's that the Democrats you feel like are no longer representing where you all are exactly in their institution
11:30
their institution has millions and billions of dollars to do a lot of these things and initiate all these things and the most active we both live Check to
11:36
Check like we we we're asking for the simple basic things not only here but the things that need to be happen in
11:43
Palestine and there still haven't been delivered on that so I think it's a given that once you once you ignore
11:48
people and and de that relationship of course they're going to retaliate they've moved away from like what most
11:54
people are are are really advocating for and passionate about can I ask specifically about the progressive wing
11:59
of Democrats one thing that stuck out to me even on the issue of a ceasefire is that you know Bernie Sanders uh
12:06
Alexander Casio CZ they've been people who have been a little closer to the Biden position and still further from
12:12
where you all are on this how I'm curious of what you think about like uh uh kind of Progressive Democrats and how
12:19
they've landed uh on this issue well again it goes back to
12:24
institutions even Bernie Sanders and AOC there's money in their pockets and there's BLT on their so again that's
12:30
another reason why a lot of grass organizers have shifted away from a lot of the people who again have abandoned
12:36
us and they said they're about X Y and Z but yeah go ahead to you want say something I was just gonna say I'm like
12:43
very interest like curious about how this conversation led to us talking about other candidates when we're just
12:49
here trying to sort of continue advocating for a ceasefire and for the liberation of all people like asking
12:56
questions about Representatives or democratic Affiliates like who are states and Miles Away who will do
13:03
nothing to impact us here is honestly irrelevant because at the end of the day
13:08
the polar like the polarized parties that exist in the United States is sort of a byproduct of the system that the
13:15
United States work to build and the lobbying and Corporation systems that they chose to have continue funding
13:21
whichever party or whatever like democrat or republican it doesn't matter
13:26
well can I say why I'm asking yeah go ahead because one thing that sticks out to me about talking to you as
13:33
someone who also talks to Grassroots conservatives um is they see the party
13:38
as a vehicle to be taken over right you talk to Trump kind of wing who are
13:44
really mad at the foreign policy establishment of the Republican party they specifically talk about how the
13:50
reason that they care about electoral politics is because they see the party as a vehicle that can return power to
13:56
set people and that that's part of the reason they're engaging in it one of the reasons I am asking is because it does
14:01
seem interesting to me that you all have not made that same calculation and I guess I'm just wondering why that's all
14:06
I'm asking yeah and I think that your your point about power is also sort of problematic because that's not what
14:13
we're trying to do nor are we thinking about power in the first place we're
14:19
thinking about equity and accessibility and Liberation
14:26
honestly I understand it is not your intention but there are arguments mostly made by
14:33
people who don't maybe who maybe think more respectability politics who may think more traditionally whatever that
14:39
whether it is your intention or not that the act of the protest has an electoral backlash that could benefit people who
14:46
would be uh even more further from what you believe even further from these demands that it helps Republicans and I
14:52
know that's not I know y'all are I know I see you squirming at the idea I'm just saying can you tell me the response tell
14:58
me the response well we've already sort of reiterated that response yeah I would love to hear it just directly we think
15:04
that that question is irrelevant because again it's very in like indicative of an
15:10
egocentric idea that we're again once again centralizing Democrats versus Republican in a humanitarian issue and
15:18
again trying to sort of weaponize what we did to say we're with or against a
15:24
certain political party takes away from the attention of what we were trying to actually do in that church which is
15:30
bring light to the ceas the genocide and in Gau and call for a ceasefire I totally get the substance of what you're
15:35
saying I guess I'm kind of confused how Interruption of a campaign event is also supposed to have no campaign relevance
15:43
right like it's to your point like it is a campaign event and the president can't
15:49
speak at them which is fine but it does seem to be have some electoral impact it's hard for me to kind of understand
15:56
how taking an action at a campaign event it's been crazy for me to ask about the
16:02
Electoral impact of s thing this isn't about his campaign event as a president
16:08
in the future this is about him being the standing president and with the historical position that he's taken on
16:15
the Palestinian issue so that stance wasn't about the Electoral coming
16:21
forward it was about him being the president now well let me ask um maybe as my final question about the your own
16:29
electoral positions individually separate from whatever like do you plan to vote in
16:34
November can I ask that is that allowed I mean absolutely our voices will not be
16:40
taken away from us okay but again we will not limit ourselves to choosing between the lesser of two evils like
16:45
we're still in the primaries we still have other options and other people that we could potentially vote for but on
16:51
Saturday though rep the Democratic primary is in South Carolina will you vote for Joe Biden you can vote for someone else you can not vote at all I
16:59
think that that is something that I can't really answer because I am a spokesperson for free pal and Charleston
17:04
and they each member's own political choice is again up to them I will not speak on behalf of group us altoe
17:11
because again that is a tactic used by politicians to sort of put us into this this or that category which I refuse to
17:23
do for the most part the protesters are not concerned with how their actions impact the election which is not
17:30
surprising considering that's not really their job however I am a political reporter so
17:37
it did leave me with a nagging question who's thinking about the Electoral politics
17:43
here that's after the [Music]
17:57
break
18:04
in the month since the October 7th terror attack and Israel's ongoing military response the growing pressure
18:11
on President Biden to support a ceasefire in Gaza is not just coming from activists according to polling late
18:18
last year from The New York Times and Sienna College 44% of Americans believe
18:23
Israel should stop its military action 48% believe that Israel is not doing
18:28
enough to protect against civilian casualties in Gaza and 57% do not
18:33
approve of Biden's handling of the conflict and so while most Democrats in
18:38
DC including progressives have been relatively quiet in their criticisms of
18:44
Biden it has become an issue with voters an early litmus test of Biden's
18:49
relationship with his base at the start of a year will H need them to
18:55
win hello how are you Hi how are you good how are you I'm doing good are we
19:01
already here am I am I the late one I only 30 minutes so by Arab
19:08
Standard time you're early which is what brought me to Abdullah hammud the mayor of Dearborn Michigan City of deborn is
19:16
my home the place that my parents immigrated to the place that I'm raising my beautiful family and I think Dearborne is the greatest city in the
19:21
whole world you know I care about my community first and foremost I make the best decision for my community and that
19:27
doesn't necessarily you have to walk a party line recently the Biden campaign convened a meeting of prominent Muslim
19:33
and Arab Americans in Michigan and mayor hammud was invited but he refused to
19:39
attend and that's a blow to Biden Michigan is a Battleground State Trump
19:44
won there in 2016 Biden flipped it in 2020 and Dearborn is uniquely
19:50
electorally important in the state it's a relatively big city and has the largest Muslim population per capita in
19:57
the country let's start with your past week you know on Friday you posted a series of tweets about a recent
20:02
experience with the Biden campaign and they traveled to Michigan to meet with you and several other Arab and Muslim
20:07
leaders you were invited but did not attend you tweeted quote this is not a moment for electoral politics I was just
20:13
wondering can you take me through your decision and how that scenario played out from your perspective you know when
20:19
I got the call to invite a campaign meeting uh with President Biden's campaign staff um I thought that was a
20:25
slap in the face um for me 115 days into this conflict the first time a
20:31
delegation is sent to Dearborn to meet with the Arab American and the Muslim American Community to talk about what's
20:36
unfolding overseas he sent campaign staff which let us know that this conflict is purely looked at as a
20:43
political uh issue an electoral problem and for us that that reduces our Indescribable pain into a political
20:49
calculation um we want to have meaningful dialogue uh about how to change course about what's happening and
20:55
in order for us to have that dialogue it must be with senior policy makers not with campaign staff oh so that's
21:01
interesting you're saying the specific thing that you're isolating here is that the people sent to meet with you were people from the Biden political
21:07
operation the campaign staff rather than people who are dictating the day-to-day Administration policy as it relates to
21:13
the conflict absolutely I mean can you imagine if 200 Palestinians are killed
21:20
every single day and from Biden's perspective he said great let's go connect with the Arab American and Muslim American Community send my
21:26
campaign manager MH to talk about the upcoming elections and how this issue is
21:31
impacting them that to us sends a clear signal um that again this is a political
21:37
calculation this is actually not a moment for electoral politics I think it's extremely dehumanizing that the
21:42
only time we talk about Palestinian lives well the only time you want to hear concerns about Arab Americans and
21:48
Muslim Americans is when it's tied to the upcoming election that assures to us that this is only a political
21:53
calculation and not a humanitarian one what's unfolding overseas the the genocide that we see unfolding before
22:00
our cameras each and every single day this is an issue of humanity and that's that's the direction and how we want to
22:05
address this m you know one of the reasons we wanted to talk to you is because earlier this week I talked to some of the protesters who interrupted
22:12
President Biden out in South Carolina at the mother Emanuel Church specifically for the purpose of pushing him to call
22:19
for a ceasefire which we both know he has not done yet uh but one of the things that they said and I hear kind of reflecting in You is kind of that
22:25
rejection of electoral politics trying to keep focused on the policy demands that they're pushing this Administration
22:31
for rather than the kind of political questions but you know not only am I political reporter but it does seem like
22:36
some political questions are kind of in the air here you know I was going back to look at where you were in 2020 and I
22:42
saw that you were someone who initially supported Senator Bernie Sanders but by the general election that you did lend your support to President Biden and said
22:50
you know to uh Muslim Americans to Dearborn residents that voting for him would quote give us uh faith that our
22:56
community will be invited to the decision-making table uh I was wondering if we could go back four years ago how
23:02
did you come to the decision to kind of support them politically at the time you know President Biden ran on
23:11
decency ran on bringing decency back to the White House he was an individual who
23:16
um uh you know said I have he has the experience to lead America to bridge The Divide to pull us out of the Endless
23:22
Wars across the Middle East and what we found is everything but you know for an
23:28
individual who ran on decency um who ran on recognizing people's Humanity at this
23:33
point in time that is not what we're seeing as a community that is reflected of Lebanese immigrants Yemen immigrants
23:38
Syrian immigrants Iraqi immigrants Palestinian immigrants each and every single one of those Nations at this point in time is being bombed directly
23:45
or indirectly uh by the us or at least funded the bombs being funded by the us as well and so for us we had thought we
23:51
had closed that chapter on endless wars in the Middle East and began to write a new one but clearly that isn't the case
23:57
you're saying that back in 2020 you thought that he represented a kind of new new vision of foreign policy
24:02
establishment I guess I'm trying to figure what's the difference I know that there specific conflict is different I don't want to ignore that I'm saying at
24:08
2020 Joe Biden was still a figure that represented a kind of where mainstream Democratic foreign policy establishment
24:13
was but you were still willing to make the kind of political calculation to support him I'm saying what at that time
24:18
gave you the confidence to think that you all would be invited to the decision-making table as he said at the time it was promises made on the phone
24:26
with the Arab American Muslim American Community okay you talk to them directly absolutely secretary blinkin was a
24:32
surrogate on behalf of President Biden we had met with many of his senior policy staff talking about policy issues
24:38
that impacted us here locally we talked about the recognition of Middle Eastern North African folk on the upcoming
24:43
census in 2030 um all these policies that they had backed prior to the 2020 election and said that they are
24:49
committing uh to getting done once in office in their first term mhm you know we talked about kind of your individual
24:56
choices here but when you think even back back to 2020 what were you hearing from dear Bor residents about the choice
25:01
between Biden and Trump and were others in the community at the time willing to make the sort of compromise you laid out
25:08
where you were where you were saying we're going to act on faith that they would bring us into the table the
25:13
majority of Dearborn residents backed uh President Biden in the 2020 election
25:18
over then president Trump but what were you hearing was that a comfortable choice or was that an uncomfortable one
25:24
it was a comfortable choice at the time okay um it wasn't like 2016 where it was
25:29
more difficult between then uh uh uh uh nominee Donald Trump versus uh secretary
25:36
Hillary Clinton that was a far more difficult choice for Arab Americans and Muslim Americans then because of the
25:41
history that Hillary Clinton had with her decision making across the Middle East and North African region interesting you're saying that the 2016
25:47
decision there was you heard much more consternation from your community absolutely well what are you hearing now
25:52
in terms of the differences from 2024 versus in 2020 people feel betrayal
25:59
people feel like they bet on a president who promised again to bring back decency into the White House to bridge a divide
26:05
to close the chapter on endless Wars to make investments locally um and what we're finding um is is the complete
26:12
opposite of that and we're also we understand that President Trump is somebody that we do not support um we
26:19
know what it means uh for him to come back to office we know about the Muslim band we know about the policies he
26:24
enacted we know about the rhetoric that he spewed each and every single time he was on camera or before a Podium um but
26:29
what we're saying right now is you know let's talk about demanding a ceasefire from this current president who made
26:35
promises to us that decency would lead um that Humanity would be at the Forefront that our concerns would be uh
26:42
listened to and for us we are a mature enough Community where you can put the pet in our hands and we can collectively
26:48
co-gn and co-write that policy about how to move forward because we have the firsthand experience of what it's like
26:53
to live overseas under occupation under apotide under siege under death and destruction the other thing that comes
27:00
to mind I think this is specific to our political reporting which has tried to focus on Biden's relationship with
27:06
members of the democratic base uh I remember you know doing some reporting about a black electorate and there was a
27:12
sense among some people that they Define themselves as Democrats because of what Republicans did not necessarily what
27:17
because of Democrats did I'm wondering how that sentiment lands with you as a Democratic elected official and how
27:22
would you describe your own relationship between how you place your priorities within the larger context of the party
27:29
that you work in you know I'm currently in a nonpartisan role as mayor of the city of
27:35
Dearborn I was elected a Democrat prior to in the state legislature what I would tell you is the way I approach it is I
27:41
look at policy by policy and I'm not one who cares much for labels and that largely has to do with growing up being
27:47
labeled so many things having grown uh post 911 you know I remember walking
27:52
home from school just days after 911 I had a gun pointed at me where somebody said keep walking before we decid to shoot you Muslim kids and I saw all the
27:59
the rhetoric the the bigotry the anti-arab sentiment uh sentiment the islamophobia for being a Muslim and Arab
28:05
and so I actually am one who likes to strip away the labels and talk about what's actually on the table whatever the best policy is to move forward for
28:11
your constituents Surly in this community to your point you do have uh residents across Dearborn or Arab
28:17
Americans more broadly speaking and Muslim Americans who are Democrats because the Republican Party refuses uh
28:23
to basically have us at the table but with the Democrats what we're finding is yes they are the big umbrella big tent
28:29
party but they have the Arab Americans and the Muslim Americans kind of at the outskirts and the edge of that tent and so when it does rain we're the first to
28:35
get splashed on you know I was thinking about politicians like you like Rashid Le another michigander and that include
28:42
other politicians I think about Congressman ilhan Omar who have tried to push the Democrats on changing the
28:48
relation its relationship not only to Muslim Americans but put on policy stances like issues of Israel uh uh
28:54
Israel's actions and that's come with boback very clearly I mean I mean how do you navigate what you see as the
29:00
responsibility to change that umbrella you talk about and the reality that it
29:06
almost inevitably comes with the vitriol with the anti-arab sentiment with the
29:11
islamophobia you're talking about like you know you get what I'm saying like the the the uphill battle seems so
29:17
uphill it seems uphill but what's the alternative you can't just sit on the sideline and and have everybody move
29:24
forward I think if you actually look at the polling what you're finding is the leadership of the democratic party is not representative of the electric
29:30
they're trying to represent 50% consider what's unfolding overseas a genocide yet if you look at our Congressional leaders
29:36
if you look at our presidents if you look at uh uh other elected Democrats they have not called for a ceasefire
29:41
they're actually not following and in heeding the concerns that the constituency they're there to represent
29:46
you know this is not going to be a Perfect Analogy so I know that these two things are not exactly the same I want to say that but uh I think back to 2020
29:55
when I remember a lot of elected Democrats kind of wrestling with how to deal with an activist class that was
30:01
pushing on issues of racial Justice that was embracing CA to do things like defund the police and I remember the uh
30:08
uh specifically the kind of step back that a lot of those Democrats took once they thought maybe activists had gone
30:14
too far uh I I'm wondering for you as an elected official I know this isn't a moment that you feel for an electoral
30:20
politics but is there any way that language has to be maintained focused on ceasefire is there any strategy that has
30:26
to go in into creating kind of Mass public support for this issue like how much do you think about getting people
30:32
to agree with you versus you think about saying what you think is correct does
30:38
that make sense it's it's a very interesting question um you know I like to say this I have a simple value
30:44
statement that I believe in that my residents believe in I do not believe in the killing of innocent men women and
30:49
children unfortunately our Congressional leaders our president his officials all
30:55
believe that there is a qualifier to the statement that there are exceptions to this rule I don't think there are
31:00
Exceptions there should be no exceptions and anybody who places an exception on a
31:05
on a value statement of no innocent man woman or child should be killed is telling me more about their moral
31:11
compass than anything else you know I get I I really do get what you're saying at the same time these protests or even
31:19
let's say your tweets to make clear that you won't meet with the Biden campaign staff when they're coming to Michigan have created a PR electoral issue thorn
31:28
in the campaign side um I guess a question I have for you is some people
31:34
have argued that this is going to create a real electoral problem for Biden among a Muslim American Community among uh uh
31:41
Arab Americans maybe specifically even in Michigan as someone who is a leader of that community in that state how real
31:48
do you think those concerns are the concerns are real but the conversation to be had about the problem that's being
31:55
created yes that question should be placed back into the lap of the president what will you do to earn the
32:02
trust and respect of the constituency you're trying to represent you know I've run for office four times and in all
32:08
four of those runs I have never blamed the constituency for not voting for me that's an opportunity for you to look in
32:14
the mirror and ask yourself what do I need to do and so again that question should be positioned to the candidate
32:20
and not to the people that are trying to make sure their concerns are heard just so you know we have put this question to
32:26
the Biden C okay and one and actually the response that we got uh was pretty much added to
32:33
you know certainly they um uh they would say they can take the concern seriously I don't want to downplay it but one of
32:40
the political answers we got was that traditionally voters have not
32:45
prioritized quote unquote foreign policy at the top of their concerns when it comes to a November election and so the
32:54
tone when we POS it to that campaign frankly puts those questions back to the
33:01
constituents to say that when the stakes become clear when there is a Biden or maybe a Donald Trump on the other side
33:08
that they trust that constituents will make the choice that of Biden as the
33:13
better of the comparable options so that's why I ask is not because I think that um like constituents or local
33:21
leaders or people who are not in you know the administration or national politics should have the burden of those things but frankly when we go to them
33:28
they make an argument that the stakes are going to kind of dictate the choices that voters are going to have to make I
33:34
guess I want to pose that question directly to you considering the reality
33:40
of our binary system and considering the unwillingness for uh Biden and campaign
33:45
to hear protesters or people making the arguments for ceasefire as you have is
33:50
there any fear that in making that argument explicitly that it creates a political opening that say a Donald Trump can exploit
33:57
you know I'm not even thinking about the November election you know but but here's how I'll answer your question um
34:04
these are not normal times this is the first time in modern history in which a genocide is unfolding and being live
34:10
streamed by the people in which the genocide is being committed to the Palestinians that has never happened
34:17
before and so this idea that traditionally speaking based on polling data so on and so forth this is how people have voted I think all that gets
34:23
thrown out the window and I would also say this when it comes down to lives being lost people being killed hundreds
34:30
each and every single day we're now in the tens of thousands millions displaced I think it speaks volumes if a candidate
34:37
is solely looking at the polls and determining how they should fall on this issue and whether they or not they think
34:43
it's going to impact their election which gets back to my original point on why we did not take a meeting with a campaign because it's very
34:49
dehumanizing and so we demand again immedia ceasefire and implore President
34:55
Biden to reconsider the the direction and the decisions that he've made and to change course if Donald Trump is a
35:01
threat to American democracy the question should stand why is aligning with Benjamin Netanyahu and his
35:08
right-wing government more important than saving American democracy you're saying let's put the question back to
35:14
them if it does threaten them in Michigan that should be that they're listening more closely correct and if
35:20
you think Michigan is on The Chopping Block the Arab American and Muslim American vote is large enough to swing
35:25
Michigan away from President Biden um then the question should be back to President Biden why is your alignment
35:31
with Benjamin Netanyahu who everybody agrees is a war criminal as a tyrant as a part of the most extreme government in
35:38
Israel's history why does that alignment and unfettered support for that government worth sacrificing American
35:45
democracy uh hypothetical I hope you'll engage with me here let's say Biden does call for a ceas fire and would you meet
35:53
with the Biden campaign would you do the same kind of thing you did in in 2020 that kind of encouraged people to see
35:59
them as people who were listening is there still time for them to become people who in your eyes
36:06
listen there is always time to do the right thing that would be my message to the president calling for a ceasefire
36:13
does not mean that we're now prepared to sit down with a campaign team we are not that trivial and that transactional when
36:19
it comes down to our politics calling for a ceasefire opens up the door to having more conversation regarding
36:26
itarian concerns regarding decision- making that's still unfolding um that's what a calling for a ceasefire would
36:32
lead to mhm you know when I talk to you when I talk to other people specifically about Biden's relationship with his own
36:38
voting base so much of it comes down to whether this campaign is going to be able to speak to the kind of mass sense
36:44
of apathy or anger as you put it betrayal in your community and much more
36:49
than uh persuading the kind of classic Independence or whatever you have the data saying that his problem is the own
36:56
kind of Base and how they feel about him right now I guess I want to ask a larger
37:01
about apathy let's take Biden and those folks out of the equation if a Dearborn resident comes to you and says you know
37:06
what right now I'm not sure I'm going to vote in November what is your message to them do you affirm that sense of apathy
37:13
are you trying to try to try to say you know like I I I guess it's interesting to me as an elected official rather than
37:19
protesters who are like yeah like does that sense of apathy worry you any it certainly worries me and my
37:25
message you know we have this conversation around a dinner table almost every single night what do we do
37:31
when we feel like you have no home when you feel like nobody's listening to your concerns my message is always all
37:38
politics are local the first and foremost thing that you can do is vote for the down ballot positions that will
37:43
still impact your life most immediately uh in the near future consider your city council consider your mayor consider
37:50
your school board consider your State House State Senate don't forget about those issues don't forget about the ballot initiatives that are still on the
37:56
upcoming election if we have apathy towards the presidential election the US
38:01
Senate because the front runner candidates are not listening to our concerns have refused to support a ceasefire are supporting an ongoing
38:07
genocide I support that decision I will not say that I do not support that decision but do not forget about
38:13
everything else on that ballot and it's important for us to still document that we voted because you still demonstrate
38:18
the power that comes with numbers mayor I really appreciate your time I said this to the protesters but I'll say it to you one of the things that we try to
38:25
do here is we got oppose things so that people can make where they come from really clear and so the same way we did
38:31
it to the Biden campaign and to the protesters I appreciate you kind of being game for that and for you laying out both a moral and political uh
38:38
thinking that I think is going to be really insightful so I appreciate your time thank you so much thank you so much
38:43
for having
38:49
me following our conversation with mayor hammood we reached out to the Biden
38:54
campaign for a response to the protest chers and the mayor's decision to skip the meeting a spokeswoman referred us to
39:01
quote more than a 100 meetings that Biden has done with state and local leaders concerning the
39:08
conflict as for the protesters the campaign pointed to what
39:13
the president said in South Carolina from the pull pit of mother Emanuel shortly after Tamara was escorted out of
39:20
the building I understand their passion and I've been quietly working
39:27
I've been quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gossip
39:36
using all that I can to do
39:42
that but I understand the passion look [Music]
39:55
folks that's the runup for Thursday February
40:02
1st 2024 and now the rundown I feel that this bodess well for
40:10
the future I think we've planted our flag I think we've made a statement
40:18
that that things are going to be different last week a Manhattan jury ordered Donald Trump to pay more than
40:25
$83 million and damages for defaming the rer egene Carol in an interview on
40:31
Monday Carol recounted the experience of coming face to face with Trump in the courtroom he was nothing he was a
40:37
phantom it was the people around him who were giving him power he himself was
40:44
nothing it was an astonishing uh Discovery for me he's
40:50
nothing we don't need to be afraid of him Trump promised to appeal the decision Micki Haley also waigh there I
40:58
absolutely trust the jury and I think that they made their decision based on the evidence I just don't think that
41:04
should take him off the ballot I think the American people will take him off the ballot I think that's the best way to go forward is not let him play the
41:11
victim let him play the loser and separately Trump has continued to mock Haley his last major primary Challenger
41:19
he issued a warning to her supporters on Truth social writing quote anybody who
41:25
makes a contribution to bird bra From This Moment forth will be permanently barred from the Maga
41:32
