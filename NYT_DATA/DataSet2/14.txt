[Music] from New York Times opinion this is the Ezra Klein

0:21
show so a bit of housekeeping ahead of today's episode we are hiring a calm
0:26
assistant for me and Tracy McMillan codom to do fact checking research clerical work it's great entry-level
0:32
role and you can find it by clicking the link in the show notes here or going to nyt co.com
0:45
careers so we've done a couple episodes recently on the Republican party and we want to follow that up with a couple
0:51
different views on the Democratic party and I think for Democrats the core
0:57
question that that I get asked the that you here asked is why are Democrats letting the this unpopular 81-year-old
1:05
president run again I think it's worth stepping back and asking if you were a
1:10
politician in the Democratic party who had wanted to run against Joe Biden what would you have run
1:16
on one theory of how you would challenge an incumbent president would be you would say he's a bad president but
1:22
actually Biden has passed a ton of critical legislation Democrats the inflation reduction act the
1:28
infrastructure bill chips and science the economy is doing pretty well
1:34
the labor market is really strong inflation is coming down so it's kind of hard to run saying Joe Biden has done a
1:40
bad job being president I mean there are important differences now increasingly on foreign policy but if you think back
1:46
eight months ago that wasn't as true the other way you could have run against Joe Biden is to say the guy's a loser he's
1:53
not going to be able to win and the crucial moment for that I think the way to think about why Biden
1:59
in the end did not face so much pressure that he either had to step aside or face a set of serious primary challenges is
2:06
that in 2022 Democrats did not get wiped out and more than did not get wiped out they
2:13
they won they did much better than you would have expected they gained in the Senate they gained in state legislator
2:19
they gained in governorships they did lose the house but they held down losses and I always thought that if Democrats
2:26
got wiped out in 2022 there really would be primary challenges and because they did so much better than expected there
2:33
wasn't really room for them to get off the ground there wasn't a critique to be made of Biden's Democratic party it
2:39
wasn't obviously losing elections it wasn't failing to govern so how are you going to attack it that doesn't mean the
2:46
Democrats have made the right decision but I think it is crucial context and context that is often lost in thinking
2:54
about why Democrats are making the Strategic decisions they're making there is this difference between how Democrats
2:59
are polling and how they are performing but the Democratic party is a complicated thing that no one player
3:05
really holds power over and so I wanted to take it from two very different perspectives and I'll say even as we go
3:11
into these episodes I don't fully agree with either theory of the democratic party but opposite ways of thinking
3:18
about something can both carry important truths or at least things worth thinking about and I wanted to begin then with
3:25
perspective that gets heard less often but I think explains more in terms of
3:30
how the Democratic part is actually acting which is that if you look at elections rather than polls and look at governance rather than Vibes Democrats
3:37
are not doing that badly it's actually a little hard to make the case that is a party making huge mistakes they
3:44
definitely don't look like a party in crisis so for this show for the more optimistic perspective on the Democrats
3:50
I invited strategist Simon Rosenberg on the show Rosenberg has been in Democratic Party politics a long time he
3:56
played a key role in Clinton's 1992 election victory he founded and was a longtime head of
4:02
the new Democrats Network which was an influential think tank that at times has been pushing Democrats in more liberal
4:08
and in more moderate directions there was very early in trying to build a stronger Hispanic strategy for the
4:13
Democratic party and he became kind of famous again in 2022 for accurately predicting that there would not be a red
4:20
wave that the belief that Democrats were going to get destroyed was not going to prove to be correct now he's the author
4:25
of The substack hopium Chronicles where he is trying to for Democrats this
4:30
constant argument that they're way too down on the party and actually they have a lot of Reason for Hope and work to do
4:36
sure but that they need to understand they're coming to this from a strong position as always my email as reclin
4:42
show NY
4:47
times.com Simon Rosenberg welcome to the show Ezra it's great to be here so when
4:53
I looked at polls at about this point in the cycle in 2016 Trump was trailing a bit when I look at polls at this point
4:59
in cycle in 2024 he's roughly even with Biden I mean it depends on the poll you look at he's maybe ahead maybe behind
5:06
but stronger than he was and most Democrats I know are freaking out about those polls so why aren't
We just keep winning elections
5:12
you because since Trump unveiled himself as Maga in the 2017 2018 cycle we just
5:19
keep winning elections right we won the 2018 cycle we won the 2020 cycle we won
5:25
in ways that people never thought we would in 2022 and in 2023 I think has not gotten as much coverage as it should
5:31
have it was a Blue Wave all across the country we won in all sorts of Republican places and flip seats and bow
5:38
initiatives all across the country and when you just look at that as a political person right that's exactly
5:43
what you want a political party to be doing we're winning all kinds of Elections right Democrats keep overperforming in elections Republicans
5:51
keep underperforming and struggling and we even saw it just this week in Iowa
5:56
despite Trump's strong Victory turnout there was abysmal I mean they had 186,000 people voted in 2016 only
6:03
110,000 people voted this time Trump only got 7% of all registered
6:09
Republicans voted for Donald Trump in Iowa it's a terrible number and so when
6:14
we actually go vote we just keep winning and they keep losing and so I go into 2024 feeling really good about where we
6:20
are look we have a lot of work to do Ezra I'm not sitting here and telling you everything is great we got a long way to go but if we run a good campaign
6:28
and execute well I think we're going to win this election by high single digits and make this election a clear repudiation of Maga
6:35
which will hopefully start to loosen its dark grip on the Republican party so you and I have known each other
What happened in 2022
6:41
a long time but I think you've had a burst of renown in politics after 2022
6:47
when you one of relatively few people out there saying this is not going to be a red wave election Democrats are going
6:52
to hold on much better than people think and that's more or less what happened they uh won seats in the Senate they won
6:58
governorship they won State legislatures they held down losses in the house you've made the argument based on what
7:06
we can see in data about the 2022 election that there were really two elections in there that had different Dynamics what were they I think it's
Two elections in 2022
7:13
sort of very foundational to understand where we are today and so in 2022 there were two elections there was
7:20
a Bluer election inside the Battleground and a reder election outside the Battleground inside the Battleground
7:27
where Democrats turned on their big campaign you know we were able to actually not just do well but we got to 59% in
7:34
Colorado 57% in Pennsylvania 55% in Michigan 54%
7:39
in New Hampshire those would be extraordinary performances in a good year and this was supposed to be a bad
7:45
year for us right we were supposed to be the party that was the Red Wave was going to wash all across the country and wipe us out and so we did
7:52
extraordinarily well where we were contesting Republicans in many cases these trumpy Republicans that were nomin
7:59
ated in these states and where the issues of abortion and democracy were on the ballot and we actually gained ground
8:06
against all conventional wisdom outside the Battleground where we didn't have these big campaigns where we didn't
8:12
control the information environment and push our turnout to the upper end of what was possible we actually lost
8:17
ground in New York and in California and it's one of the reasons we lost the house in 20122 and so to me the
8:24
admonition is where we run our big campaigns we do really well when we go
8:30
head-to-head with Republicans and the Grassroots of the democratic party is focused we keep winning but when we
8:36
don't run those campaigns it reminds us of the power of the right-wing noise machine and their politics which is
8:42
still formidable and we can in any way discount the significance of their
8:48
ability on a daily basis to dictate the daily discourse in the United States and so we need to in 2024 we need to get
8:55
much more focused as Democrats about being loud and trying to close was that what I call the loudness Gap with the
9:01
right in order to be where we want to be in 2024 I want to pick up on a few
The loudness gap
9:06
questions and and counter theories there so one you said something interesting which is that in these Battleground
9:13
areas Democrats controlled the information environment they ran their campaigns and I read it differently
9:20
which is to say that in those Battleground environments what actually happened is that Republicans controlled
9:26
the information environment and ran their or Maga actually in many cases controlled the information environment and ran their campaigns and that is an
9:33
extraordinary counter mobilizing Force for Democrats something you said there I think is really important I don't think
9:39
people quite realize that it was Democrats in New York and California who lost the house by not coming out so
9:46
those were not huge Maga elections those were not elections people felt had a a big sense of weight to them and because
9:53
they then had low turnout Democrats uh gave up seats but in the Battlegrounds where Maga candidates were a mobilizing
10:01
force for Democrats Democrats did great and so there is a theory of the
10:06
democratic party right now Michael B horer the former AF political director kind of makes this argument that it's an
10:12
anti-a Coalition that it is turned itself into a vessel to stop this other
10:17
political tendency and where that tendency is on the ballot it rises and where that tendency is not on the ballot
10:23
it struggles does that track for you yeah I mean the anti- Maga theory is
The antiMAGA theory
10:30
something that I actually promoted very heavily in 2022 during that time where I
10:35
was battling the Red Wave and I think there is an what I often said during that time was there was an anti-m Maga
10:41
majority in the country that we saw show up in 2018 and 2020 and so the question
10:46
is would it show up again in 2022 I mean I wrote a piece in the fall of 2021 saying that I thought this would be
10:53
a close competitive election and not not a wave election because of this because there had been you know the Republic
10:59
Republicans have made you know in the grand scheme of politics right when you have a a politics that loses twice in a
11:06
row as it did for the Republicans in 2018 and 2020 magga that is usually a party runs away from that politics
11:12
because that's a it's failed and they lost elections and they lost the house the Senate and the presidency in those two elections the Republicans didn't do
11:19
that they ran right towards Maga right they doubled down they became super magga and that's a in my view an
11:26
enormous strategic error that is continuing through to today right I mean we saw this play out not just in 2022
11:32
but in 2023 it's already playing out in early 2024 I think Maga is even unattractive
11:38
to Republican voters and I think the Republican party is splintered what's interesting for me about this is that if
11:44
you watch cable news if you watch MSNBC you know a third of the contributors and a third of the people on TV are former
11:51
Republicans right and some former fashion we've never had that kind of
11:56
Abandonment or splintering of a modern political party In Our Lifetime yes mag is deeply unattractive and my argument
12:04
is that Trump and mag are even more unattractive more dangerous more ugly
12:09
more extreme in 2024 than they were even in 2022 and 2023 and so if this has been
12:14
a failed politics in all these elections they continue to double down on it then
12:20
I think it's why I'm so optimistic about what we're going to be able to do this year but let me flip part of that
Democrats outperforming Republicans
12:25
Dynamic on you you made the point you often see these former Republicans on on msnb which is true and there is a slice
12:32
of the Republican Party the Democratic part has begun to win over which is these more educated um higher
12:38
information which these folks are of course you know at the Apex of and the argument you will hear from people who
12:44
are a lot less sanguin about this in you are is that Democrats have been outperforming in 2018 and 2022 and 2023
12:51
because they've won over a kind of voter that used to be Republican and is more likely to come out in a lower turnout
12:57
special election more likely to know what's going on show up at the polls but
13:02
in a presidential election where you get a lot more kind of unusual voters where you get a lot more low attachment voters
13:09
Republicans are doing you know stronger numbers among some of those factions and
13:14
it's not like Donald Trump saw his number of Voters collapse from 2016 to
13:20
2020 more people voted for Donald Trump in 2020 than voted in 2016 it's just even more people than that voted for Joe
13:27
Biden but it was close enough that a shift in the wins could lead to Joe
13:33
Biden winning the popular vote by 2.5 points and losing the presidency so there is no margin here well listen I
Democrats outperforming Republicans in 2024
13:41
understand the theory and it's a theory it's not actually played out in practice it could happen in 2024 it might be what
13:49
happens but it hasn't happened right the theory is that you know all this the fact that Democrats just keep winning
13:55
everywhere in red States and blue States and ballot initiatives and offe elections and special elections isn't
14:01
going to translate over into 2024 and yet when you look at what's happened when we've gone to the general
14:07
election since 1992 Democrats have won more votes in seven out of eight presidential
14:12
elections no American political party has done that in our history it's the best popular vote run for a political
14:18
party in American history and in the last four elections we've beaten the Republicans on average by 51 to 46 right
14:25
a five-point Gap the last time Democrats average over 50% of the vote in four
14:30
consecutive elections was during FDR's presidency and so we're in the midst of our best presidential run that we've
14:37
been on since the 1930s and 40s and this idea that somehow something's going to
14:43
happen in this election that has not happened in seven out of eight of the previous presidential elections and
14:49
isn't happening across the states it's a theory of somebody who doesn't really work in politics every day because
14:55
that's not really how politics works right there isn't one set of dynamics that are playing out again and again and
15:01
again all across the country and then all of a sudden everything dramatically shifts and so I know this could happen I
15:08
understand the theory a lot could happen a meteor could hit the earth tomorrow I don't think it's going to happen in 2024
15:15
for all the reasons that we discussed earlier about the countermobilization against Maga which is still the most
15:20
powerful force in our politics far more powerful than disappointment in Joe Biden and the
No such thing as a popular vote
15:26
Democrats so I have this EXP sometimes when I listen to you because it's very persuasive on one level and then I also
15:32
have this kind of like like wait but like I've just been living through this other thing happening which is there is
15:39
no such thing in the American political system as a popular vote presidential election the only thing that matters is
15:44
the Electoral College I am old enough to remember Donald Trump winning the Electoral College in 2016 it feels very
15:51
fresh as a wound I'm also old enough to remember that he had a republican House and Senate then Democrats did win that
15:58
back in 2018 they you know although they did well in 2022 they did lose the house right uh there is a republican speaker
16:05
now in fact theyve been many republican speakers since Democrats lost the house in in 2022 Republicans control more
16:12
Governor's Mansions they control more State legislatures there is a lot of truth to
16:19
this and so as a corrective I buy it right there is a tendency I think to see
16:24
Donald Trump and Maga as this Unstoppable political force and the polls are now feeding a kind of panic
16:31
about that among Democrats but also to listen to you you're describing a
16:36
dominant political party that is wielding power continuously but Republicans have the Supreme Court they
16:42
have the house they have the governorships they have the state legislatures Democrats have the presidency and the Senate I would not
16:49
say well the Democratic party is an obviously dominant party on historic run of success yeah I I mean I don't agree you
We are in a democracy
16:57
know I understand what don't you agree with don't discount the importance of a popular vote right I mean we're in a
17:03
democracy and winning more votes than the other side is the core of what a campaign is I mean are we in a democracy
17:08
though well I mean this often times we're not I know and I've written about this extensively and you and I actually the last time that you and I actually
17:14
really connected was actually over this issue right about how our power is appropriated in the United States and
17:20
how you know you can be a party winning elections by five points and still not be in power right now I I just want to
17:26
remind your listeners that you know people say the popular vote doesn't matter in a in a general election of
17:32
course it does because there are tons of down ballot races below the Senate and House races all across the country and
17:39
so you know winning an election by four or five points of course it matters
17:44
right because there's all these other elections happening too and so both can be true right you want to both win the
17:50
popular vote and you want to win the electoral college so I what I look at
17:55
and the reason that I am talking the way that I talk about about this is that what's happened to a great degree is
18:01
that we've had a couple bad elections where Republicans have run up the score and it's one of the reasons why they've
18:07
maintained so much political power around the country but on balance where I'm satisfied with our performance is
18:15
that you know for a party that when I got into this business back in the late 80s and early 90s where the Republicans
18:22
were on this incredible presidential run the Democratic Party in the late 80s and early 90s was getting wiped out at the
18:29
presidential level and the reason that the new Democrats came about was to reverse that and was to create a
18:36
competitive National party again and since 1992 in Clinton's presidency we've won more votes seven out of eight times
18:42
and yes two of those elections we didn't win the electoral college and they won the presidential election but the goal
18:47
was to make us competitive at a national level again when we weren't I mean this idea that at some point the Democrats
18:54
used to be really strong and have sort of fallen down the exact opposite is true we used to be really weak and we
19:01
were getting killed in national elections and now we're not in fact we're in the best popular vote run that
19:06
we've been on you know since the FDR's presidency I can see Joe Biden's path for victory as a strategist right he's
19:13
been a good president he's going to have a strong case re-election we keep winning elections all across the country
19:18
Trump to me is a much weaker candidate than he was in 2016 in 2020 I don't know
19:24
how you dress this guy up Donald Trump and make him look like a serious candidate for president again I just
19:30
don't think it's possible and part of the reason why is not just because he's more extreme and more dangerous than he
19:36
was and Maga is more of a threat to the country but his performance on the stump is far worse and more wild and so when I
19:44
look at somebody who's been doing this for over 30 years what I see is a really crappy presidential candidate and I
19:50
think we're going to kick his ass you know you're a strategist and you see a a path to clearing victory for Joe Biden
How to win the information war
19:57
so if you were running that campaign what's the approach what's the message what what would you be telling
20:03
Joe Biden to be doing saying emphasizing we're going to have a hard time I think
20:09
in the day-to-day information War what Trump still have and what the Republicans still have is they're much
20:15
louder than we are just his ability to dominate The Daily News and to give us
20:20
very little space to make our case and I think this is also exacerbated by Joe
20:26
Biden's age and just his you know this is where his age is not an asset I think in general his age is an asset it's made
20:33
him a strong president but I think it means that as somebody who grew up in politics in the War Room in 1992 which
20:39
was really about Reinventing the way that information and media is done in a
20:44
campaign and how you contest the information space every day the theory of the campaign in '92 coming out of the
20:51
loss of ducus is that we had to contest the information space every day then any attack that was made if we didn't rebut
20:57
it or counter it would stick we were very on the front foot we were fighting with Incredible intensity the Biden
21:04
Communications operation to me has a slightly different understanding of all this which is that they believe there
21:09
are things that are never going to amount to anything that's going to matter and they can kind of ignore them
21:14
and I just don't agree with that and I and I don't agree with that from having been in this game for a long time I was
21:20
a guest on Fox news for 17 years and did thousands of appearances on Fox I mean I've been in this thing pretty deeply
21:26
for a long time and I think if my greatest advice to the campaign is that we just there has to be a Tempo and an
21:33
expectation that they are fighting with unbelievable ferocity and intensity every day in the information space in
21:40
order for us to control the information environment and to allow us to win and that's to me the most important thing
21:46
that we need to do in the coming months I don't think they're ever going to do that and let me try an analogy on you
Trump is a street fighter
21:52
that's been in my head which is that Trump is a street fighter his theory of the information information space is out
21:59
of a street fighter he's going to punch at it and hit it with a pole as hard as he can till it like crumbles beneath him
22:07
and Biden and his team going back now some years and I think this might be
22:12
somewhat mediated by their own concerns about him or what he's willing to do and not do but whatever it is they do iido
22:19
they try to let the other person create the energy and use it against them I actually think the one thing Donald
22:26
Trump and Joe Biden agree on is that Donald Trump should be in the news every day and Donald Trump should control the
22:32
information space look getting into the news this is my profession is not a
22:39
mystery if you're the president you announce things that are significant enough you say things that are
22:46
conflictual enough or you do things that are unexpected or outrageous enough Donald Trump does all of them constantly
22:53
to the extent that he can right there's a reason he's showing up at all these hearings and getting in arguments with the judge
22:58
he wants that covered on the news if Joe Biden and his team believed it was good
23:03
for them or wanted to or believed Joe Biden was good at being in constant fights with Donald Trump they could
23:10
unload on him like day after day after day after day and I think their View and
23:15
this has been my sense them for some time is that it is good for them when Donald Trump dominates the news because
23:21
again it's a counter Maga Coalition it's an anti-a Coalition and as long as you
23:27
have some MAA figure driving the story day after day after day that will
23:32
ultimately counter mobilize the Democrats and the countermobilization of the Democrats is larger than the mobilization of the Republicans that's I
23:39
think what they're trying to do I'm not saying it's my preferred strategy but that's my read of them I think you're
Democrats have to feel the campaign
23:45
exactly right by the way completely right and I talk to them all the time and I'm I'm close to both the campaign
23:51
and the White House what I don't mean is getting in his face every day Democrats have to
23:57
feel the campaign they have to feel us fighting they have to feel the intensity
24:02
because part of the reason we've been winning so much is because of this countermobilization and the
24:08
countermobilization isn't just with voters it's with our activists there is
24:13
a massive new Democratic political machine that has grown up organically in
24:20
recent years it was very accelerated during covid when these new technologies allowed remote activity and one of the
24:27
remote activities is a zoom I mean what's happening now is that there are hundreds of thousands of Democrats who
24:32
are listening to people like me over a zoom and campaign people and other folks
24:37
Democratic politics every week on zooms where they have this far more intimate relationship with politics than they
24:44
ever used to have and so what's happening is the counter mobilization is also providing our
24:49
campaigns more money than they've ever had in our history we're building unprecedent large campaigns with the
24:54
biggest field operations we've ever had and there are more volunteers to fit into those campaigns than we've ever had
25:01
before because you can now not just export your money out of California you can export your labor and you know I had
25:08
yesterday I mean we won this race in Orlando and I spoke to Fentress Driscoll who's the State House leader for the
25:14
Democrats who I worked with very closely on this race and she said at the victory party Simon a woman came up to me and
25:21
said I'm here I drove two hours to be with you and do gov cuz Simon asked me to go help you guys right
25:28
and so what's happening is this counter mobilization has created the strongest Democratic party than any of us have
25:34
ever seen and it's why you know what I wrote in the fall of 2021 is I said because of all of this we had more tools
25:41
to mitigate midterm drop off than we've ever had before and I felt that we were going to be able to use that to have a
25:48
good election in 2022 well that huge machine just played a major role in
25:53
winning an election in Orlando Florida that nobody in Florida thought we were going to win we flipped the state house
25:59
in Virginia just in November which none of the political operatives on the ground thought we were going to do and
26:05
we keep doing things that we didn't think we could do we keep performing at the upper end of what's possible as
26:10
Democrats because of this machine this countermobilization you're describing and I think it's just going to be too
26:16
big and too overwhelming for Donald Trump in 2024 because it's independent of any candidate it has nothing to do
26:23
with who's running it's not connected to an ideology it's the simple thing Democrats are going to save the country
26:28
Republicans are dangerous and you've got millions of proud Patriots who love their country who are fighting to make
26:34
sure their democracy doesn't slip away they have nothing like [Music]
26:56
that [Music]
Is Donald Trump and democracy
27:04
so I want to go back to the question I asked you about Biden and his path because when I said what would you tell them to do you said fight but I actually
27:12
meant to ask something closer to what should this be about one thing they want to make it about clearly is Donald Trump
27:18
and MAA and democracy right you go to Biden's big speech a couple weeks ago about democracy in January 6 they're in
27:25
many ways running against Donald Trump almost as if Trump is an incumbent but Joe Biden is the incumbent and you go
27:31
back to 2020 and how they ran then they ran against Trump and he was the incumbent and they ran against the
27:36
pandemic right they ran against the Trump administration's pandemic operation and at which at that point was
27:42
completely flailing and right now there is no pandemic at that level that is
27:47
dominating politics obviously there's a lot of Co going around Donald Trump is not the incumbent and the bigger problem
27:54
Biden faces I think is widespread voter dissatisfaction with the economy which is somewhere where I do think polls are
28:00
are important I don't believe polls are predictive of Elections this far out but they are reasonable snapshots of public
28:06
opinion and people are not happy with the state of the economy and when you ask them who they Trust on it they say
28:11
they trust Donald Trump so in terms of what the B demonstration should be saying about itself in the election what
28:18
should they be saying well listen they've made it very clear based on that speech in valet Forge that they believe
Joe Biden on the right track
28:25
the sort of foundational contrast is Joe Biden you
28:30
know protecting democracy and Donald Trump trying to end it and it's a pretty powerful argument it's actually been
28:35
working pretty well all across the country and it's also true right I mean it has the virtue of being true and we
28:42
know from polling and market research that we all do that creating a narrative
28:47
about who we are around freedom is incredibly powerful and and this has been heavily tested by lots of different
28:54
people and it's how we've been running Franklin in these elections that we keep winning and so I think first of all he's
29:02
on the right track I mean this is a very good early orientation I do think there's also going to be an element of
29:07
the campaign that's about you know making the case that he's been a good president and then rolling out which I assume is going to happen to the State
29:13
of the Union his second term agenda and these things are also going to matter a lot I'm I'm a little bit more optimistic
29:20
than you are about our ability to sell his economic story because I don't think
29:26
the country is down on the economy I think that Republicans are and if you look at Democrats and the
29:32
people that are available to us and the people who we have to talk to to get to win the election they actually give
29:37
Biden very high marks on the economy and they think the economy is doing really well I think this is one of these polarized issues that we just like the
29:44
Biden approval rating I don't think it's nearly as descriptive as people think it is so I think we can make progress there
29:50
I don't know that we're going to catch up with Trump on the economy but I think we there's a lot of ground we can make up this year once the campaign really
29:57
engages and so your point I want I want to stop there for a minute because I think this is actually very important
30:03
and is a big question for me in the election I'm not pessimistic or optimistic on their ability to sell an
30:09
economic message what I do think is true is that I spend time looking at the
30:14
consumer sentiment data I spent time looking at the polling here I spent time looking at the various indicators we
30:20
have of of how the economy is doing and how people are feeling about it and what looks both like a huge opportunity for
30:26
them to me and a genuine problem for them to me is that there is a gigantic Delta between
30:34
what the economy looks like and how people feel about it if you were just running this through a statistics
30:39
machine Joe Biden's record looks fantastic like you want to be Joe Biden
30:45
created a huge number of jobs unemployment is extremely low wage gains have been very strong inflation was up
30:52
but now it's down we are outperforming European economies that kind of look like our superficial
30:57
like if you you sound like me now but this is this is just the economic facts right like a campaign is an effort right
31:04
to tell a story we have a serious affordability crisis in my mind specifically in housing and a couple
31:10
other things but that's been going on for a very long time but in the economic data it looks very strong you would this
31:17
is the data you would want as the raw material to tell a story and whatever
31:22
they're doing to tell the story or not tell the story it is not working elections are also about the public
31:28
perception they are not they are not just about people reading the Michigan consumer sentiment index how do they how
31:34
do they close that Gap so number one just like what happened in 2022 where
31:40
everyone thought we were going to lose because there was low Biden approval and high inflation and we ended up having a really good election You know despite
31:47
the disappointment with the economy that you're describing we keep winning everywhere because going back to the
31:53
thing that you said in the beginning of the interview is there's a force in our politics that's more powerful than
31:59
disappointment in Joe Biden and the Democrats which is the fear and opposition to Maga that's the thing
32:04
that's been driving our politics since 2018 and it's going to drive the election in
32:09
2024 the second thing is you're right a campaign is about putting information into people's heads that they don't have
32:15
right I mean that's the core of what you do in a campaign that's why advertising exists right is your moving narratives
32:21
and stories that you need that people need to hear that they may not totally understand look part of what's a
32:27
challenge now there isn't one information environment in the United States there
32:33
are at least two and there maybe even more but Republicans are living in a completely different information
32:39
environment than Democrats are or than non magga non- Republicans and in the non- Maga information environment the
32:46
economy is actually doing well people are happy no wait I want to push you on this because I know where you're going
32:51
here I can show you tons of data on this yeah but but I I know the media environments very well and what I would say is yes there's a a very MAA
32:58
information environment there's also like obviously a more liberal information envirment but most people
33:04
are not in really either one of them most people just don't read that much news because the news makes you feel bad
33:10
and people have other things they want to do in their lives they they get the news ambiently and I want to say extremely clearly I think that is a
33:17
perfectly reasonable life choice to make right like that is the way human beings mostly operate lives are busy they have
33:23
other things they want to focus on I always say that the biggest divine in the news is not left to right it's
33:29
interested uninterested the news is fundamentally a hobby I can look at the polling on how people feel about the
33:35
economy and I can tell you the number of people dissatisfied is significantly larger multiples larger than the number
33:42
of people watching Fox News to say nothing of watching or absorbing smaller than Fox News conservative Outlets so I
33:49
don't want to just give that all the the news no I'm not going to give it all to the news but I just let's just go to data right I mean because I think that
Economy
33:55
one of the things you were saying earlier is that there are we have to distinguish when we talk about these things particularly here in your kind of
34:01
setting between things that are true and things that people believe because they're not the same and it's really
34:06
important in a time of rising untruth that we don't give up on the idea that there is an objective reality out there
34:13
and the objective reality is the country's far better off than when Joe Biden came to office in the midst of
34:19
covid a huge recession Insurrection and all the other things that were happening and that's why I believe that over the
34:26
course of this election he's going to be able to make the case that he's made the country better which was his primary
34:31
goal as president and he's got a strong agenda for the second term right but I go back to this basic idea if you look
34:37
at polling and in polls high quality large interview polls on the economy
34:45
Democrats are giving Biden very high marks on the economy and believe the economy is doing really well right there
34:52
is a huge Divergence in the universe that we have to talk to that's it's available to us
34:58
cuzz 40% of the country is not available to us we have no ability to reach them people are not nearly as down on the
35:05
economy as the overall numbers are they just aren't I mean this is clear as day when you look at these other measures
35:11
life satisfaction job satisfaction income satisfaction right life satisfaction numbers are up in the 70s
35:18
and 80s job satisfaction numbers are up in the 60s income satisfaction are in
35:23
the 50s right and if you look at the axios poll that they released just the other day on questions of how are you
35:29
doing not how's the economy doing the numbers are way up in the 50s and 60s
35:34
and so what it means to me is that we can make significant progress on this
35:40
issue we may not catch up to Trump but we can't expect to have the election we want to have if we're trailing Trump on
35:46
the economy by 10 points and so we've got work to do here but to your point we have really powerful raw material to
35:52
make the argument and I think television advertising and a real campaign where we're Prosecuting this stuff every day
35:58
I'm optimistic we can make progress because it's true and things being true does matter in a campaign it's easier to
36:05
win arguments that are true than to win arguments that aren't true traditionally in a campaign it's not always the case right but usually the case so what we
36:12
have to do is doable in traditional Politics the things we have to do are doable the things they have to do I
36:19
don't think are doable I don't think that they can take this guy because let let me make one basic point about Trump
36:26
which we haven't talked aled about is that the question was asked of Iowa voters Iowa Republicans if he is
36:32
convicted of a crime would you view it as a disqualifier for him being able to run for president 30% of those voters
36:39
said it would be a disqualifier if you want to talk about a blinking red warning light about the
36:47
potential for the Trump candidacy to collapse and for us to have a route in the election the data is there if you
36:53
want to look at it the second data piece on this NB C Sunday poll with de Mo
36:58
register Haley voters 20% of the Iowa electorate were asked in the poll would
37:04
you vote for Trump or Biden in the general election 43% said Biden 22% said
37:11
Trump I mean these are crazy numbers I mean if we get 40% of the Haley voters
37:18
right we're going to be getting up into the 50s now I don't think they'll all come with us but there is incredible
37:24
clear data from this past week that Trump is a deeply troubled candidate and
37:30
that he could easily go into the general election at the most wounded degraded candidate that we've seen in the modern
37:38
[Music]
37:55
era [Music] you worked for Bill Clinton you were in
Obama and Clinton
38:03
the Barack Obama Democratic party orbit yep and both of them I think are are
38:08
interesting here if you go back to their midterm elections they got stomped absolutely stomped under Clinton
38:14
Democrats lost the house for the first time in in 40 years under Obama the Democratic party just got annihilated in
38:21
2010 and they both looked fairly weak obviously Joe Biden had a better
38:28
midterm than they did and he's pulling a little bit behind where they were which people can interpret in different ways
38:35
but what lessons do those politicians have for himmer the Democratic party now
38:41
what can Joe Biden learn from what Clinton and Obama did to then win reelection both of those campaigns
Bidens Lessons
38:47
started much earlier than the Biden campaign has you know Clinton was an incredible politician and was in the
38:52
game every day and let his team loose early on in 1995 we really set the terms of the
39:00
debate early which really you know we ended up winning re-election by eight points so I mean it was an enormous
39:05
victory in in 1996 and Obama same thing I mean the campaign was much further along than
39:12
where the Biden campaign is now and so to me the urgency of the moment is they
39:17
they've got to just accelerate the development of the campaign campaigns are organic things they grow you know
39:24
it's like building a battleship right you can't do it overnight you can't just flip a switch and a campaign turns on
39:30
you have to hire people and some people don't work out and you try tactics and they don't work and you got to learn
39:35
from it you got to keep reiterating all the time and this is why I'm talking about the need for them to engage more
39:41
funly in the day-to-day battle because we've got to we've got to go through an accelerated process of getting this
39:46
thing into a general election day-to-day general election mode we have a very short window here now I mean the general
39:53
election is really beginning I mean it's now Trump's won functionally and we're in the general election I
39:58
think Trump is going to start attacking Biden much more frontally very soon I would imagine even with his ads and and
40:03
in terms of their Day-Day engagement because he doesn't really have any opposition in the Republican party anymore and I think the campaign isn't
40:10
really ready for that right now and so to me the most important thing is Biden
40:15
world needs to accelerate the development of the campaign I think a lot as a lot of
Bidens Age
40:21
people do about the role Joe Biden's age will play in the campaign I mean you look at polling Biden's age is the
40:27
number one concern voters have about him but then I've been trying to think about what is that concern at its core because
40:33
something you'll hear people say I've said something like it I think he's been a pretty good presedent right not that I
40:39
wouldn't argue with some things he has done but I think economic outcomes are looking strong I think his management of
40:45
a lot of foreign policy crises has been very stable like very steady the ability to build International coalitions has
40:50
been very impressive the Congressional Dynamics have been very good they've gotten a lot of big legisl passed that
40:58
said I think two things emerge here one is that organizations reflect their
41:03
leaders that is a like a truism across any organization you can think of businesses campaigns everything and what
41:09
you were saying about Bill Clinton about Barack Obama about the the energy of it right Clinton being like out there right
41:15
immediately after the loss in the midterms Barack Obama right beginning to try all these Grand Bargains and super
41:22
negotiating committees and right just endlessly out there showing that like he's trying and he's and Biden hangs
41:29
back right and I think his organization strangely not strangely predictably has this quality of him there is a a lack of
41:38
energy to it because there's a lack of energy at this point to him which I do think is age related I followed Joe
41:43
Biden for a long time this is not something I would have said about the Joe Biden of 2000 or 2008 or
41:50
2012 that's one dimension of it the other dimension of it that worries me is
41:55
that I think at a very fundamental level and this is going to be reflected in a piece I'm working on the Democratic
42:01
party has become the party of normaly almost like the conservative party in a
42:06
more philosophical way the party that is saying we are going to keep American democracy we are going to have
42:13
relatively competent people in the relevant positions doing the things they're supposed to be doing it's not
42:19
Democratic socialism it's not intense around um different forms of identity
42:25
anymore like like under Joe Biden and in relationship to Maga the Democratic party at least for this moment in
42:31
American politics is the party of normaly and the one problem with that for them is it Joe Biden is himself
42:38
somewhat abnormal he is just older than we've ever seen in a president and in terms of that promise of stability of
42:45
consistency the promise that on an emotional level is a party saying to everybody look those people are nuts
42:53
we've got this we have the people who can just keep this under control and then people see Joe Biden and he doesn't
42:59
project that command to them I mean command is a performance it's a sense of what people are capable of it's energy it's not just outcomes and that feels to
43:07
me to be where right now I look at his age and I see it actually affecting things I think that he hangs back um in
43:14
part because of whether they don't think he's an effective messenger or he doesn't or he doesn't want to I don't know but it it just reflects something
43:22
now in him that is now we're seeing it in the campaign and I think this fundamental thing they want to say which
43:28
is we are the party of people you can trust and they're the party of people who God knows what people worry about
43:35
his ability to do this and they've not even tried as best I can tell to answer that right like you could imagine things
43:42
they could do but they are not trying and those things concern me yeah now listen I I really I was listening very
Biden on Age
43:49
closely to what you were saying because I think it's very nuanced and you've obviously you know you're writing a piece about it so you've been thinking
43:54
about it and it's I think it was very well well articulated and so let me try to respond
44:00
um I do think that we have to litigate the age issue in this election and the
44:06
way that I tell Democrats all the time we have to run towards it not run away from it because it really matters it's
44:11
front of mind for voters and we can't pretend that it isn't and I think we have to make the case that you know as
44:17
somebody who's formerly young myself that when you get older you not just lose a step but you also gain wisdom
44:23
experience and capabilities and that that wisdom experience and capability have been Central to his success and
44:29
that his success as president is actually because of his age not despite of it I do believe that we're going to
44:36
have to invest a lot of money and energy in explaining why the first term was successful you know he offered to do one
44:43
thing in the first term which was to get us to the other side of covid effectively and he has and he he needs
44:49
to own that I think and to make it clear that you made me president to do this
44:54
thing I did it we're on the other side I think that he's going to be able I think to make a
45:00
very clear argument that you asked me to do something I did it I got two more big
45:05
things I want to do with all of you together if you elect me we can do those things together and make continue to make progress this next set of
45:12
challenges have to be grounded I think deeply in this fight for democracy domestically and abroad and I also think
45:18
climate change is this other existential fight that's in front of us and so I do think there's a way to address all that
45:24
but the other part of what you said is that I do think the communications burden of this election is going to fall
45:31
much more on the campaign than is traditionally the case I mean think about the difference between running a
45:38
campaign for this Joe Biden and running it for Barack Obama or Bill Clinton who were two of the best communicators in
45:43
modern American history it means that the campaign has greater responsibilities and so it means that
45:50
the ability of the campaign to execute the team that's in there their strategies their day-to-day operations
45:56
they're you know mobilizing you know what I've called for is a reinvention of the war room right this is part of the
46:02
new way we have to be thinking which is the War Room in our Mind's Eye is 20 sweaty kids drinking red bulls you know
46:08
producing Tik Tock videos and what we need the War Room to be now is two to three million people who are networked
46:14
into the campaign amplifying the good works of Joe Biden and the Democrats to redesign a campaign so that the campaign
46:21
itself is louder is taking on more Communications responsibility knowledging everything that you're
46:27
describing right it has to do more and be better than most presidential campaigns have had to be in recent years
46:34
which is why you know we needed to get going right it needs to accelerate its growth but look you're raising really
46:40
important issues I think these are all things that can be managed they're not unmanageable in a political context I
46:46
think fixing Donald Trump and making him look like a presidential candidate is not something that's is
46:52
manageable I want to talk about some Trends inside the Democratic party that stretch before and Beyond Joe Biden and
Changing Party Composition
46:59
the big one is the changing composition of the parties so it's I think Lee at this point known to say that Democrats
47:06
have gained higher income voters lost working-class voters um I'll put some numbers to that in 1968 52% of white
47:15
people who never attended College voted Democratic um in 2020 only 35% did when
47:21
you look at voters of color Donald Trump improved his margins um among particularly workingclass Latinos
47:28
between 2016 and 2020 Democrats did not hugely roll that back in
47:34
2022 so even if Democrats can win elections with this sort of emergent
47:39
higher income you know more educated Coalition why are they losing workingclass voters and what can they do
47:46
about it I don't have the numbers right in front of me but I I'm pretty sure that Biden won voters under $100,000 in
Working Class Voters
47:54
2020 yes but by less than Democrats used to and that's consistent across elections going before Bud I think but I
48:01
but this is important because we're not losing workingclass voters we actually won workingclass voters in 2020 right
48:07
and because of the strong performance with Hispanic and you know minority
48:13
people of color workingclass voters and yes some of the margins have been cut a little bit and we'll see if that happens again in 2024 I mean I think 2020 was a
48:20
highly unusual election because of Co more Hispanics had to work in inperson jobs jobs fewer had health insurance and
48:27
I think the the shutdown Democrat argument against Biden in 2020 that
48:32
Trump made actually was material and it's still material today in our politics because I think for some
48:38
younger working people Biden got on the other side of opportunity for them and whereas Trump was the guy fighting to
48:45
make sure they could continue to earn a living right and to feed their family and that for Biden the shutdown argument
48:51
I think is lingering and as part of his brand that we've never really been able to fully overcome and I think it's
48:57
particularly important for people of lower socioeconomic status who needed to work every day in order to feed their
49:03
family right who had no reserves we have a more acute problem with white working class than we do with the overall
49:09
working class and the erosion that's taken place the so-called erosion that's taken place with Hispanics and
49:16
African-Americans I don't think is as great as some have argued and let me make my case for this is that on
49:21
Hispanics and as you know this has been an area that I've been a Pioneer in working with the Hispanic Community I
49:27
mean I did the first bilingual poll ever done in the Democratic party and produced the first Spanish language ads back 20 years ago and part of where I
49:34
think a lot of the analysis in the Hispanic vote has gotten completely wrong is that it's not factoring in the
49:40
growth of the population and so if you get 65% of a 100 that's 65 votes right
49:48
but if you get 63% of 200 you have more you know a smaller piece of a bigger Pi
49:53
you still get more Pi so in the Southwest in the heavily Mexican-American parts of the United
49:58
States Democrats are far stronger in every state than they were 20 years ago
50:04
we are burying the Republican party now in the southwest and in California and we're even getting reasonably close in
50:10
Texas and we can't do it against Abbott but in the other elections we've gotten reasonably close and so I think things
50:16
are not nearly as dire as some folks of my colleagues in the in the industry have represented in my view I feel like
Educational Polarization
50:23
this is a little bit confusing thing through statistics or at least taking statistics that tell you different
50:28
things I take your point on the bigger pie smaller percentage is still more Pi
50:35
nevertheless if you keep losing percentage eventually you get less of the pi and so there's an erosion here
50:42
right we watched it with Democrats with the white working class I mean you could have said that for some time it's like okay well they're still winning the
50:47
white working class they're still winning it oh now they're not winning it but it's close enough and now and so
50:52
something is happening here whether you buy all of educational polarization or not I'm on record many times saying I
50:59
think educational polarization is tracking something else than what people think it is tracking it is some kind of referent for class and I think there's
51:06
issues of cultural representation there and whether or not people feel respected and other things happening so I don't
51:11
love the educational polarization conversation nor am I going to completely throw it overboard I'm with you by the way can I endorse your
51:17
interpretation of that wonderful I I appreciate that but you know you are seeing very and I take your point on the
51:23
Southwest but again if Republicans begin closing that proportion Gap eventually
51:29
they're going to close the election Gap too but they're not this candidate Donald Trump this candidate can't do
51:34
that maybe he can well I don't know I mean I would not have expected if you had told me from 2016 to 2020 for all
51:40
the messaging the Democratic party and the sense that like what Donald Trump was doing was destroying the Republican Party forever among voters of color but
51:48
maybe winning over these racist whites actually what happens is that Joe Biden wins the election because Suburban whites move over to him even is they
51:54
suffer very surprising defections among voters of color in different ways and so
52:00
I think you should take more seriously than you are or I would at least like to get you to answer the question from the
52:06
perspective of somebody who takes more seriously that Democrats understand themselves to be the party of the working class and even if they do have a
52:13
majority now among voters making less than 100,000 that is they are increasingly reliant on a different kind
52:19
of voter and that is both a question for building a bigger majority right at some point you got to start winning back some
52:25
of these working-class voters if you want 55% it's also a a kind of spiritual
52:31
moral identity question right if you're the party who your whole thing is that you are trying to make things better for
52:37
working-class Americans and you are losing your margin among working-class Americans I think you should wonder what
52:43
is happening here so if you were to buy that what would you say is happening here yeah no so I I want to be clear
52:49
that I think also to get granular on the data right I think we're seeing more erosion with working class men right I
52:56
mean I think there and that also may have to do with Trump's machismo and his yeah that's closer to my theory of it
53:02
yeah no no I I think that that that's very real because it's not just people of color there didn't used to be such
53:09
big gender gaps in black and asmatic communities and now they're starting to be significant gender gaps which the
53:14
abortion issue in the Hispanic Community is exacerbating I'm not dismissing this at all we have to be concerned about the
53:23
erosion you're describing but we also have to be careful to be accurate in
53:30
understanding what is actually happening and yes if we keep eroding if we keep seeing a diminishment of our vote with
53:36
Hispanics some of the margins we have will be diminished but that's not what's happening I want to be clear right I
53:42
mean we are doing better in Arizona in the parts of the country with heavily
53:47
Mexican-American populations than we've ever done I mean where where I find one
53:53
of the people who make this argument ruy to Sarah to be so comical frankly is
53:59
that his book is called you know where have all the Democrats gone and yet we've just gotten more votes in the last
54:04
four presidential elections than we've gotten since the 1930s and 40s we're actually doing better nationally than we've done since he's been alive and the
54:11
idea that we're losing things as opposed to gaining things net is just not the right way to look at all this our
54:18
coalition's changing right we have to adapt to it in part because their party is changing and I think we have to be
54:25
and to do what you're describing which is we have to really study this stuff and come to an understanding about how do we build majority coalitions and so I
54:33
hear you on the spiritual piece of this and I think that we have work to do here look I want to be very clear I'm
54:39
optimistic but we have a lot of work to do big chunks of our Coalition have wandered from us right now and we've got
54:46
work to do to get them back largely young people people of color right are wandering from the Democratic party
54:52
right now and if you look at polling they're not not wandering into being non voters they're wandering into third
54:58
party options for now right and so we're going to have to contest with these third party
55:04
candidates we're going to have to go in there and fight it out Joe Biden's not going to just have to run against one candidate he's could be running against
55:10
four you know alt together but I'm confident that we have a strong enough argument and if the campaign is strong
55:16
I'm confident that we'll be reasonably successful you made this point that there were distinctive Dynamics in 2020
Young Voters in Israel
55:22
around Co that might have really cut Democrats among Hispanics I think that the possible analogy to that this year
55:29
is young voters in in Israel and I'll be honest that two months ago I wasn't taking this that seriously I kind of
55:36
figured it would blow over an American polling and that may still very much be true you know when you think 10 months
55:42
into the future but when I look at the polling now it it does seem very real to me this is something that emotionally is
55:49
very real to the people following it which if you're on social media you're one of them now you know more often than
55:55
not and I'm curious how you take that the possibility of a fracture over
56:00
foreign policy between Biden and and young voters who he very much needs to turn out who did turn out in 2022 but
56:07
that was before this war yeah I mean who turned out in 2018 20120 and 2022 right
56:12
I mean we've had very very strong historical performance with young people in recent elections would a foreign
56:18
policy issue like this become a top tier voting issue for any age cohort in the
56:24
country in a general election that's going to be about so many other things right it would be unusual for that to
56:30
happen and for the marginal 25-year-old young voter in the United States the
56:35
idea that in November Israel Hamas will be more important to them than their job
56:41
or health care or democracy or abortion or climate or guns it's unlikely that
56:46
that's the case I think there is though however an influential small group of young people
56:53
who this is going to be a top tier voting issue and they're very organized and they're very loud and they're going
56:59
to be part of what we have to deal with and it's one of the reasons why I've been very aggressive about trying to get
57:08
the youth oriented part of this campaign up and what I hope is that we're going to see the most sophisticated most
57:14
well-funded youth campaign that we've ever seen in modern American history I think the Biden team has to do this I
57:20
don't think they really have any choice I think we're going to do really really well with young people we're going to do
57:26
particularly really really well with young women because of abortion and all the issues I think we've got to start
57:32
really treating the gender gap that's growing in the youth vote which is connected to some of the other things
57:37
we've talked about today is something that has to become more understood about
57:43
what's happening with young people I mean young many many young women are just not available to Republicans
57:48
anymore and may never be for the rest of their lives by the way I mean I think this abortion extremism that we've seen
57:54
which we haven't really talked about very much today is the kind of thing that could cause the Republicans to lose
58:00
elections for a generation I mean it is one of the most extreme policy outcomes in in American history stripping rights
58:07
away from more than half the population what happens with men is going to be we're going to have to contest that more
58:13
I think that some of the Allure of Trump's machismo and his kind of Joe rogish positioning has been attractive
58:20
to a lot of young men and I think we're going to have to go in and fight it out with young men in a way that's going to be very different from young
58:27
women one of the the reasons I think it's important to look at the shifting composition is the parties have to adapt
Shifting Composition
58:35
I mean you said this a minute ago have to adapt to who is actually in them and when you do that it shifts what you can
58:41
say what you can do right I mean this is very true for the Republicans I mean we can talk about the Democrats all day the fact that Republicans have to adapt to
58:47
being a Maga Coalition and have to say things that only that people in Maga agree with like the 2020 election was
58:53
stolen is a real problem for them for Democrats there is a I think the concern
59:00
and you see it if you read um ru's book you could see it if you read my colleague David Leon Hart's book which is a more sort of economic take on this
59:07
uh his book is called ours was The Shining future and it's a I think a very deep look at some of these issues and
59:13
the argument is that the Democratic party as it has become more connected to
59:20
these higher income more educated voters has begun to reflect their concerns more right so emphasize things like
59:26
environmentalism abortion things like that that were certainly tough for abortion before dos but I I think behind
59:33
that is also reflect their cultural taste more I think one of the things
59:38
that that happens with the educational polarization conversation is people want to look at it as materialism but it's
59:44
partially a question of of class representation it's something Donald Trump and and some Republicans are are
59:50
increasingly good at is saying to people who feel like they're on the outs of American Life whether they really are or
59:55
not I see you I like you you're great these other people are terrible you know their Elites looking down on you and the
1:00:03
Democratic party is losing the kinds of Voters it seems to me that don't like a
1:00:08
Vibe within the Democratic party right you you know they like the consumer protections right but they're not really that connected to politics so calling up
1:00:15
the policies from one side or the other is not really how they think about politics but they look around and they
1:00:20
see a party led by people who they don't think would like them if they met them
1:00:25
right that the most important question in politics is not do you like the candidate but do you think the candidate
1:00:30
would like you and that's the vulnerability here that if these Dynamics persist we're not just talking
1:00:37
about vote totals we're talking about what a party feels like to people because it it reflects who has power in
1:00:43
it as Democratic party has more and more people with literal power in society inside of it it reflects that that turns
1:00:49
off people who feel on the outside of that power structure and that also just creates a very combust kind of
1:00:55
polarization in the country that is I think my like deeper concern about the set of things not that you can't imagine
1:01:00
an electoral winning Coalition you can imagine feedback cycle effects in terms of what the parties are that is not
1:01:07
great for the country not great for them but also not great for what the party the Democratic parties traditionally
1:01:12
intended itself to be there's a lot there Ezra sure
1:01:17
is we have to just ground ourselves in the reality that Trump has lost and the Republicans have lost the 2018 2020 2022
1:01:25
and 2023 elections um and so the loss is their loss not our loss right and we
1:01:32
have to not allow ourselves to sort of get to a place where the Democratic party is in trouble or losing I just
1:01:38
don't I mean but I'm not saying that I'm saying there other dynamics that are worth taking seriously I know but I mean I think this notion that the Democratic
1:01:44
party is sort of in trouble or in losing you know I I just reject that in in many
1:01:50
of these arguments well what about able to Vanquish MAA right not win election by a bit not win the Senate but lose the
1:01:56
house not win specials by a bit but actually destroy it well let's see what happens in 2024 I mean I I want to go
1:02:02
back to this basic reality that I think is not present adequately in the daily discourse that we all have with each
1:02:09
other which is that something really significant has happened in the last two years which is the party in power has
1:02:15
actually gained seats all across the country it's an anomalous event and so
1:02:20
to me this is the most important electoral data that exists far more important than any crappy 800 sample
1:02:27
poll that's being done out there right now because we keep having a dramatic
1:02:32
thing happen there is a massive repudiation of Maga happening all across the country I'm going to answer your
1:02:39
question here in a second but I want to start by not conceding that the Republican party is strong and winning
1:02:45
they're not and so I don't know that there their formula successful and I think what you're going to see in
1:02:50
2024 is a really substantial and significant splintering of the Republican party I
1:02:56
think the never Trump or never mag a former Republican wing of the Republican party I mean if we were in a parliamentary system right now there
1:03:03
would be a new party right a center right party that would have emerged with Liz Cheney as the head of it she'd be in
1:03:08
our cabinet we would have you know Maga would be down in the 40s right in the low 40s and polling and we would be a
1:03:15
sort of a coalition government we can't do that in our system I do think the Biden campaign is going to have to figure out some way to do that virtually
1:03:23
I mean if we have list chain and Mitt Romney and Adam kinger and all these folks campaigning for us in 2024 it's
1:03:31
going to make a big difference it's going to create a huge permission structure for Republicans who are not
1:03:36
Maga which is could be up to 20% of the Republican Party by the way we're talking about huge numbers and I do
1:03:42
think going back to what you said earlier my my other response to all this is that you argued earlier that we're
1:03:49
the party of normaly right I mean that we're the party that is presenting a normal face for America very normal guy
1:03:55
one of the most religious presidents in modern American history right that the face of the democratic party is one of
1:04:01
normaly and regular people and that that's part of our goal we have investment is being made in red States
1:04:07
and red districts all across the country because of Biden's you know huge investment agenda we're not running away
1:04:13
from Republican voters we're trying to run towards them and help bring them into our Coalition and so I think all
1:04:20
again I go back to this basic view that the things that we have to are doable every party has issues I mean have
1:04:26
assets liabilities you got challenges and things but I don't think we're as culturally if we were so culturally out
1:04:32
of it why do we keep winning elections again and again and again and so I think this has been exaggerated in my view I I
1:04:39
think it's an a problem to be managed but it's not a problem that is defining the Democratic party and frankly on the
1:04:45
issue of the polarization you're talking about that polarization has been created
1:04:50
and fostered by a political leader and by his allies in the right-wing media and the idea that somehow we're
1:04:57
responsible for the polarization in the country right now I think is just unbelievable Joe Biden has been
1:05:04
a good president he's been a good president for everybody so I stand by this basic idea that the Democratic
1:05:11
party is strong we're winning elections I'm proud of my president proud of my country proud of my party and I think
1:05:17
we're going to have a really good election and I think there's obviously Ezra to your point there are things to
1:05:22
worry about things to manage but I think on balance things are going really well and I'm really looking forward to this
1:05:28
election and engaging with the Republicans frontally and having these arguments out in the public always our
1:05:33
final question what are three books you'd recommend to the audience yeah I these are three I
1:05:40
prepped for this and it was an interesting question because it was not what have I read recently but what would I recommend and and I so three I just
1:05:47
finished a book called a new deal for the World by Elizabeth borgart I think a
1:05:53
lot about how the four freedom speech that FDR gave in January of 1941 was
1:05:59
really the beginning of the modern democratic party as we know it and and it put us on the side as Democrats and
1:06:06
I'll just do this really quickly is that part of my whole story that I tell is that the world that we imagined and
1:06:12
build as Democrats in the 1940s has created a golden age in human history there's never been a more a better time
1:06:19
to be alive in the history of the world in the history of humanity than it has been during this period of pax Americana
1:06:25
and the world that we imagine and built together and as I tell Democrats in my talks that we're part of the most noble
1:06:31
political Enterprise that's ever existed the Democratic party we've done more good for more people than any other
1:06:37
organized political entity in human history and that's why this fight for preserving that Global Order and making
1:06:43
sure that people of the world their kids and their grandkids have the opportunities that we had is so Central
1:06:49
to everything that we need to do now as Democrats we've been called before and we're being called again
1:06:54
the second book that I just went back and have been rereading is on tyranny by
1:06:59
Timothy Snyder and his first chapter which is called do not obey in advance is something that I literally think
1:07:05
about every single day about everything that I do and it's a very powerful articulation of how we can't yield to
1:07:13
the authoritarian narrative story impulse we can't self-censor and that we
1:07:18
need to create our own reality and stay in our own reality and not yield to what they want want us to do I think this is
1:07:25
so Central it's a central operating principle I think for Democrats and for people who are pro democracy in the
1:07:31
United States now and then the third book a little bit less weighty was you know I'm a big fan of Daniel silvas and
1:07:38
his latest Gabriel Wan book The Collector is something that I just recently I finally got to had been
1:07:44
sitting on my bedside for months and I just love his
1:07:50
books Simon Rosenberg thank you very much thanks Ezra for what you
