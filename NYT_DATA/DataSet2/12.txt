Everything You Need to Know About New Hampshire



0:00
[Music] this weekend as we all arrived in New Hampshire for round two of the GOP
0:06
Primary I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path
0:13
to Victory accordingly I am today suspending my campaign Ronda Sanz
0:18
announced that he was dropping out of the race but that wasn't all Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe
0:25
Biden that is clear I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I
0:30
will honor that pledge he also endorsed Donald Trump he has my endorsement
0:35
because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yester year a repackage formed of warmed over
0:41
corporatism that Nikki Haley represents and took a parting shot at Nikki Haley
0:46
who was still challenging Trump for the nomination so right after Dan santis
0:52
made it official my colleague Caitlyn and I walked around the lobby of our hotel in New Hampshire talking to our
0:58
colleagues about about why he fell so flat and what his decision to drop out would mean for Tuesday's
1:05
primary oo why do I think Ronda santus flopped people didn't seem to like Ronda
1:10
santis very much and it really seems like Dan santis completely miscalculated the GOP electorate I think
1:18
from looking at New Hampshire this is not a state where the culture War issues that D santis put at the top of his
1:23
campaign resonate at all um he focused on issues of wokeness when polling
1:30
showed that Republican voters cared much more about the border and the economy
1:35
and he tried to be Trump light and people wanted real Trump he was still at
1:42
points painfully awkward if you watched the video he put out announcing the end
1:47
of his campaign it really could have been produced by artificial intelligence
1:54
when the santis drops out it's hard to imagine his voters going towards Haley and indeed a lot of national polling has
2:00
showed that uh former president Trump is the number one second choice of Voters
2:05
who were initially supporting uh Governor DeSantis so it's pretty clear that most Dan sis voters will go to
2:12
Trump and they're not a lot of them I have to say that I think now that we're down to a twers race the big question is
2:18
what the margin is between the two candidates if it's close we could have a continued race if he blows Haley out of
2:25
the water it's hard to see how this primary continues much longer which is of course what the Trump campaign is hoping for in
2:33
other words desantis's decision to drop out doesn't change much at all it just
2:39
makes official what was already true New Hampshire is a two-person race between
2:45
Nikki Haley and Donald Trump today a guide to the New Hampshire
2:52
primary and the distinctly New Hampshire voters who help explain how it could be
2:57
a close race between two wild ly different candidates from The New York Times in
3:05
Manchester New Hampshire I'm aad hearnen this is the
3:12
[Music]
3:19
[Music]
3:25
runup this definitely feels Trump Ric already yeah
3:30
we're about to walk by this merch table president Trump save
3:36
America not vaccinated fully armed LIF figure die baby yeah we are in
3:44
New [Laughter] Hampshire even before Dan santis dropped
3:49
out our plan was to go to a Haley event and a trump event Trump is holding a rally at 7:00 p.m. tonight it is only is
3:58
it what 12:30 Trump and his supporters came into New
4:03
Hampshire on a high all the telltale signs of a trump rally are in on the street you got your cars driving past
4:10
with American flags honking and ring people up and you have a big emerging
4:15
snaking line outside of the arena for people who are here uh 5 6 hours early
4:22
before Iowa polling in New Hampshire showed Nikki Haley within single digits of Donald Trump driven by support from
4:29
IND dependence since the caucuses and Trump's 30-point victory over his Rivals
4:35
the former president has expanded his lead and that's even before the santis dropped out and endorsed
4:43
[Music]
4:48
him nice little remix on God Bless the USA God bless Trump in the
4:55
US all righty let's see how long these folks have been in the line

5:19
you really think you're well bundled you got some you got Trump scarf hat and
5:27
this might be obvious but why did you decide to come and why did you decide especially they come so early I love Trump wanted to get nice and close have
5:33
you seen them before um inauguration 2016 2016 but this is the first time since then yeah are you in New Hampshire
5:40
wrest yep okay uh I guess I know who you're voting for in the primary did you think about any other candidates or were
5:45
you always with Trump always Trump always Trump what you think about what happened in Iowa last week like you know
5:51
him winning and things did that change kind of love yeah I loved it yep what are you expecting for New Hampshire
5:56
hopefully the same hopefully the same result there's been a lot of talk how Nikki Haley might be doing better in New
6:02
Hampshire I me when you're in your communities when you're around are people talking about who they're going to vote for who do you think is going to
6:08
win on on team um definitely definitely Trump why why are you so confident considering you know some other people
6:13
have thought maybe other people do better um I I I go to a lot of bars around town a lot of clubs and
6:19
everybody's talking about Trump and how he's going to take it yeah what's your name David David all well cool nice to
6:27
meet David thank you
6:33
usy are you guys in line um well we're about to leave line why are you leaving
6:38
Lon cuz it's cold and we just found out it's not open for a few hours I don't care if Jesus Christ is in there it's
6:43
cold so we're notamp oh yeah best state in the Union yeah yeah uh can you tell us a little about yourself how old you
6:49
are like what have you have you always voted like things like that sure yeah I
6:54
mean so I've been voting for Just Two elections I voted the first time in 2016 what do you do
7:00
uh deliver heating oil a truck driver cool awesome I mean why did you decide to come here that might sound of like an
7:06
obvious question here and uh I've never been to a trump rally so it just seemed
7:11
like fun and Trump's hilarious so I mean get to see the guy live but you plan a vote for him yeah did you think about
7:18
any of the other candidates or were you always kind of with Trump um well I liked F uh he dropped out so now it's
7:26
either you know Trump or neocon so it's an easy choice right have you always been a republican I've always been
7:32
registered Republican but like I guess I'm I'm like a Libertarian what do you think makes
7:38
different than a place like Iowa you know who just voted last week kind of went well we're Freer yeah that like
7:43
overall we rank freest like we have the most like unique amounts of freedoms here we have no sales tax we have no income tax we no capital gains tax we
7:49
are the only state with no seat Bel law we have no helmet mandate we have no State mandated minimum wage U we have
7:55
constitutional carry you don't have to register your Firearms you can buy fireworks here we don't have capital gains tax you don't have an inventory
8:01
tax the models live fore or die I mean where do you get that many unique freedoms in one state yeah yeah what do
8:07
you think it is about those type of freedoms in New Hampshire that might lead it to Donald Trump why is that a
8:12
match you're comparing to your other options right so I show you a video of
8:18
on I guess it's just the closer match right yeah compared to like Nikki Haley
8:23
who wants to go to war with everybody and Trump's usually airs on the side of let's not get involved in that compar to
8:30
uh let's get involved in Ukraine let's get involved in uh this Israel conflict let's get involved in Afghanistan let's
8:35
get involved in Iraq every time let's get involved like everyone has their pet their little pet they want oh I have a war I have a war me too me too me too me
8:41
too and Trump was like eh it's kind of stupid and so I respect that you know you said um he said you thought he was
8:47
kind of funny how much of Trump's appeal to you is like policy stuff versus his like personality % policy 20%
8:54
personality okay and what about the personality great he's just great he's
9:00
just funny he's got good humor and humor is important humor people like oh what do you care about with policy and everything but it's like humor matters
9:06
cuz that's like your soul so it shows a lot about someone if they're actually funny they're genuinely funny they're genuinely because it it shows connection
9:12
to other souls and then Nikki Haley is just a straight up soulless like Hillary Clinton like Republican counterpart like
9:19
completely like just robot like like uh who's the Facebook guy Mark Zuckerberg
9:25
style like all the blood drained out of you like dead Rock disgusting Bill Gates style like you can just throw all those
9:31
people in a barrel thank you for talking to us little chilly yeah yeah yeah how are
9:40
you doing no coat no you got you got the gloves on but you how are you doing ex all right oh y how long you been
9:48
here probably uh hour and a half two hours two hours is this your uh first
9:54
time seeing Trump or if you saw him before um I've been uh doing all the
10:00
rallies I've been to Ronda santis uh events I've been in Nikki Hy events you've been going all around yeah but uh
10:07
only just to see what's going on in flag waving and stuff like that at their events but uh you know they they're uh
10:15
nothing like this I mean obviously who has vendors like this yeah there's
10:21
nothing like it there's nothing like it you will never F I've been where from where you based uh Nash you're you're
10:26
based here in Nash in New Hampshire yeah so you to have some special pride in him being back in your home state for this one absolutely I mean it's very corrupt
10:34
uh State we got a dirty uh governor who's back who's tied to the bushes you know you realize Governor sununu's
10:40
father was governor John sununu was Chief of Staff of Bush senior who used to talk about the New World Order right
10:48
how has the Republican party you think changed over the years how do Donald Trump changed the Republican Party well what he did is he exposed all the
10:54
corruption right now we know who the traitor at okay and if Donald Trump comes out on top do you think this
11:00
primary is over oh absolutely I I mean nobody's got a shot I've put up more
11:06
Trump signs 10 times more signs on people's uh properties and businesses
11:12
than Nikki Haley has in the entire State I think anything else you want to tell us a little yeah your name a little bit
11:18
about yourself my name is Dan I'm a union carpenter sure says union carpenters for president Trump 2024 and
11:26
I'm as we walked out a guy was loudly making his thoughts known with a refrain
11:32
we've heard many times at Trump events hey who's with me Joe and that dirty ho
11:38
got to go yeah you think bra Nikki Haley can get
11:45
people to come out this early this damn cold I don't think so her damn Neil con
11:52
War Boger and have an ass could get five people I
11:57
bet
12:06
[Applause] as the arena fills with Trump fans a
12:12
thank you very much New Hampshire this is a great honor to be with you tonight we got plenty of time we slipped
12:19
out to check in on Nikki Haley there's some cars it's not like empty by any
12:25
means but you know Haley was holding a rally in nashwa about 30 minutes away from Trump's event in Manchester you
12:32
know there's some Nicki Haley signs outside but there's not like the type of um palpable enthusiasm or energy or
12:41
fandom that you see at the Trump event while the room was full it was only
12:47
about 500 people and unlike the scene in Manchester which felt like a tailgate of
12:53
Trump's biggest fans like I feel like I'm going to like a a ACC Counting
12:59
convention this was more quaint hi my name is a this is Caitlyn
13:06
we're from The New York Times we're talking to people about why they decide to come out why they're supporting Nikki maybe have five minutes to chat with us
13:13
I'm from Connecticut oh you're from from New Hampshire so did you come down specifically for to come from um she's
13:19
from DC I'm from Connecticut and she's from Ohio oh you so we came up to do door knocking and push for Nikki what
13:27
what made you all decide to to get involved then that takes a different level of commitment um she's just the
13:33
candidate that I think would be the best fit for president um on the issues and
13:38
she aligns with my values and you know not too far from here there's a very rockus Trump rally happening right now
13:45
I'm guessing like for you all who prefer Haley like what do you think about the prospect that you know it could be Trump
13:52
again even as people who I imagine don't want that to happen so I've been with Haley since she
13:58
mentioned air marks at the Iowa State Fair and I think Trump and Biden were both terrible on spending I think Trump
14:06
added to our debt he increased the deficits Nikki Haley is a true
14:11
alternative she's young she's optimistic and she's truly different um is your opposition to Trump more about policy or
14:19
personality do you think or it could be both um I supported him in the previous
14:24
two elections but I would say his personality and I agreed with some of
14:29
his policies but I just don't think he's what we need right now so yeah how about you um for me I I supported him in 16
14:37
and in 20 but January was a deal breaker I think you can put as many good people around him but he's still Donald Trump
14:45
and I just can't support it anymore yeah so the six and kind of what happened after the election was the deal breaker
14:50
for you I I just lived too close to Washington DC I was afraid for my friends and I I can't support him any
14:56
longer um you know Iowa obviously went Trump's Way by a big margin he's leading
15:01
here like what are your expectations for on Tuesday what would you consider success I mean we're here because we
15:07
want to win um I flew here to volunteer because I think her coming in strong in
15:12
New Hampshire really sets her up for other states so high expectations but I think she can win New Hampshire yeah it
15:18
feels like this state really matters for her right it does yes thank you all so much can you what are your names yes um
15:25
my name is Sarah Muska awesome and I'm Courtney Madison thank you guys have a good one
15:33
the next person we spoke with Susan was on the same page she was determined not
15:38
to vote for Donald Trump his politics are fine and I think he did a lot for our country and I wish they would have
15:43
finished the wall and and done a lot of his you know the economy was better all of that but it's just he's almost like
15:52
um it's all about me and thank me thank me thank me all the time um he's just
15:58
his personal it is just too big too much about himself you know I don't like his way he treats women a lot of times no
16:06
right up in Manchester right now there's this big Trump rally happening where people lined up outside we were outside earlier today at 2 p.m. people have been
16:13
there since 7:30 9 a.m. how can like the Nikki Haley's of the world how do they catch up with that level of energy that
16:20
seems like a different level of devotion oh I know I just I just don't know but I'm hoping that they will obviously in
16:26
New Hampshire there's a lot of Independence who can participate in the primary there's more Republicans uh who did you back in the new in the New
16:33
Hampshire Primary in 2016 if you don't mind me asking was Jeet Bush running then Jeet Bush was still there at the
16:39
time I wrot I wrote jet bush in yeah so you've been you've been seeing some of this Trump takeover from afar of the
16:45
party how do you feel about that like how does that you know someone who tried to pick Jeb Bush Nikki Haley those are
16:51
different types of politicians how's it been watching him kind of take over the party in that time I don't I don't know
16:56
how I don't know how Trump mesmerized his people I just I just don't know and I'm personally offended by a lot of his
17:04
personal values you know again what he what he did for us was good the economy and all of that but his personal
17:13
values he just seems so vengeful if anyone dares cross him or question him
17:20
you know it's all about him yeah for you would you vote for him in the general
17:25
election if it came down to him versus Biden I don't know I might write in Jeb Bush
17:33
again that's how that's how opposed you feel to him yes yes but I I'm no way
17:38
would I vote for Biden though we would describe a trump rally as kind of like a party atmosphere or or kind of like a a
17:46
tailgate what is this atmosphere like well I haven't been to a Donald Trump event but I think this has a lot of
17:51
energy this has a lot of um excitement about Haley um but it's much more
17:59
um I don't want to say Elite much more elegant let's say that much more elegant
18:05
it's not all about her it's really about the party in the country and how she can serve us not how Trump can make himself
18:13
bigger and better and yeah are you a New Hampshire resident yes I am are you someone who's going to vote for her on
18:19
Tuesday I am okay when did you decide that when did you make the call back when she first announced she she has
18:25
been so positive and against divid Visions in this country we need to bring the country together and I think she can
18:32
do that that's your main reason is the positivity of her message are you someone who's been a
18:39
republican do you consider yourself a republican I would consider myself more a republican than anything else okay
18:45
although I do have an open mind and I will vote Democratic if a republican candidat is to
18:51
extreme did you vote for Trump in the general election no never V never voted
18:56
for Trump we could not live together in the same house he said he said I know that he
19:02
hasn't cuz otherwise he would be not I said I don't know if this is a benefit to you but um I said it to someone also
19:09
who was working fin Nikki she reminds me of the same energy that Hillary had when
19:15
she was running against Trump and it's inspiring and invigorating What specifically about it
19:22
do you think makes you think about that comparison she hit all the points yeah
19:27
in Her speech it's the it's the preparation it's okay and she has a lot of experience and she's seen everything
19:34
um and I'm not normally Republican so are are you someone who you're not a republican not really I'm independent
19:43
now but I I'm an independent voter but I will be voting for Nikki I don't just up the road in Manchester we were outside
19:49
and there was a big rockus event for Trump right he's in the middle of this kind of crazy rally happening up there
19:55
like how do the Haley of the world match that type of energy how do they Galvanize enough people to be able to
20:01
combat what seems like a little party atmosphere that Trump has already created W Nikki has a positive message
20:08
Trump has a negative message and that's what you think is going to be the thing that helps us that
20:14
is the thing that helps her Trump is a bully and he'll lie and say anything
20:20
that will go for him he believes if you tell a lie enough times people believe
20:26
it is the truth and told plenty of Lies I guess I'm wondering about like Iowa
20:31
and those results when you saw that big margin that he won by did that worry you any did I mean sort of made me more
20:39
motivated to come out tonight and to vote on Tuesday can we just have your's names my name is Chris Bailey and I'm
20:46
Carol thank you so much no thank you all we really appreciate it thanks for being here no problem we have a
20:53
gra ladies and gentlemen one person who was really trying to motivate voter
20:59
please welcome the governor of the great state of New Hampshire Chris
21:08
suu was New Hampshire Governor chrisen nun you guys
21:14

21:20

21:31
are sonunu has criss-crossed the state in recent weeks as Haley's top surrogate
21:37
ahead of the primary with all due respect to to Iowa thanks for playing but give me a break I
21:43
mean do you know Trump got 56,000 votes in Iowa out of over 3 million people is
21:50
that's like less than 2% is that going to dictate the choice of the Republican Party hell no I don't think so you know
21:58
what's going to dictate the choice you guys are now the key to all this is the vote getting out the vote right so you
22:05
guys get it you're here the higher the vote turnout the better chance we have of shocking the world and actually
22:10
delivering a win and it's possible it is possible now she's what we what are we trying after the break will New
22:16
Hampshire actually Shock the World the three things we're watching for in tonight's [Music]
22:26
results
22:32
okay estad it is Monday morning we are sitting on the floor of your hotel room
22:37
in Manchester New Hampshire Ronda sandis dropped out of the race
22:42
yesterday and we've spent the weekend talking to Haley supporters and Trump supporters with all of that in mind what
22:50
are the main things that we should be watching for on Tuesday on primary
22:55
day I think I'm basically looking for three things what Republicans do how motivated they are in respect to
23:01
Tuesday's primary what Independents do considering there's so many of them in New Hampshire and then also what
23:07
Democrats do there's some drama on their side also so take me through the first one of those what Republicans are going
23:13
to do what are you interested in there what are you looking for there well it's kind of the obvious question you know
23:19
will Donald Trump be as dominant in New Hampshire as he was in Iowa and will Republicans rally around him in such a
23:25
way where we see a similar type of 30 point is Victory uh because I do think the closer it is to 30 the more pressure
23:33
there will be on someone like Nikki Haley to drop out the closer it is to maybe single digits the more reason
23:38
Nikki Haley will have to keep pressing on to South Carolina so if the polling
23:44
is correct and Donald Trump does in the night at the top of the results in New Hampshire how big is that distance
23:50
between him and Haley okay so that's Republicans what about independence yeah
23:55
I mean one thing that's really come through both in in our own New Hampshire reporting and to talking to the people
24:00
who follow these different campaigns is just the central importance of these Undeclared Independents in New Hampshire
24:06
remember it's an Open Primary which means that you don't have to be a registered Republican to participate in
24:12
the primary and that gives an opportunity specifically for someone like Nikki Haley to try to appeal to a
24:17
wider sect than just a hardcore conservative base in order to close the gap between her and Donald Trump I think
24:23
there's been a recent shift in tone that specifically we've seen at Haley that really points to the importance of
24:28
Independence and how her campaign is trying to court them what do you mean by that what's changed when we saw her in
24:34
nashwa it was really clear how Haley is being a lot more specific in her attacks
24:39
against Donald Trump and then yesterday I don't know if you saw it but Trump went on this rant at this
24:45
rally and he's going off how Nikki Haley didn't allow security into the capital
24:52
Nikki Haley kept all that from happening where was she at the riot she should have been at the yeah what is he talking
25:02
about I wasn't n DC at on January 6 I wasn't at the capital but you know what
25:10
look at Joe Biden two years ago and look at him today that's just what
25:17
happens we have to be honest about that she is going directly ask the kind of
25:22
age question in the room with both Trump and President Biden don't you think we need to have metal competency test for
25:28
anyone over the age of 75 she's bringing back her calls to have mental acuity tests for candidates over
25:35
75 70% of Americans don't want to see a trump Biden
25:44
rematch and she's really framing herself as the last possible person who can stop
25:49
what feels like an inevitable march to a 2020 rematch and think she's also sharpened her attacks about Trump's own
25:56
deficiencies she's gone beyond her Norm normal line of saying that just chaos follows him you don't befriend dictators
26:03
and Thugs who want to kill us at the event we were at New Hampshire
26:10
she talked about how he cozied up to dictators talked about how he added
26:16
money to the national debt how he didn't follow through kind of on the general premise of delivering Republican policy
26:22
victories and that's all coupled with her kind of core message that she's been saying from the beginning about
26:28
electability she's been saying that Donald Trump is someone who can't beat Joe Biden but now she's going beyond
26:34
that to say that if Nikki Haley was at the top of the ticket You' have Republican wins up and down the ballot
26:39
so I considered Saturday a kind of preview of the Haley that's been waiting to emerge until it's a one-on-one
26:44
matchup with Donald Trump she's been kind of saving her attacks till this moment and premiering them in the last
26:50
couple days and like how different is this speech that Haley is giving from
26:55
the things that she's said before yeah on the trail yeah I mean for my ears it was pretty different particularly
27:01
hearing the change in her messages from the debates where she was largely not mentioning Donald Trump and focusing on
27:06
her other opponents till now where she's gotten the kind of one-on-one match up she won it but you know I wanted to gut
27:11
check that kind of feeling and so I grabb Jasmine Ula The Times Reporter who has been following Nikki Haley for
27:18
months to try to ask her okay is this messaging new and if so when did Haley
27:23
start talking about Trump like this this is definitely not the typical stum speech she has really sharpened her
27:29
argument in the last few days here she's really sharpened her case against Trump
27:35
she's really been lumping Trump and Biden together as part of this Old
27:41
Guard saying we need to move forward the line of most people 70% of
27:46
people don't either of them yeah the majority of Americans don't want to see two 80 and Trump's in the 70s but she
27:53
says the majority of Americans don't want to see two 80-year-olds running for president mhm we often see this with
27:59
candidates like saying their most like sharp attacks in like the final couple days like what is the campaign's Hope
28:07
like why are they doing this now why didn't they do this two months ago I think well she told us this directly
28:13
herself when we goggled with her on Friday you know she said ahead of the Iowa caucuses that the goal was to winow
28:21
the field and now that the field has been winnowed it's about drawing contrast between herself and Trump and
28:26
so I'm really curious to see if it works yeah if she decides to stay in this race
28:32
and make it to South Carolina I think the next 2 3 weeks we're going to be hearing her really hammer away on these
28:38
type of attacks to siphon away support for Trump because while she can rely on the independence in this state by the
28:44
time she's going to go back to her home state of South Carolina no one knows more than Nikki Haley that that's a real conservative base the number of
28:50
Independents really shrink when you go from this state to that one so she's been increasing her attacks against
28:55
Trump from the right and that's with the lens forward looking ahead great and
29:02
so you mentioned at the beginning of this that the Democrats are here too what are the Democrats doing and what
29:08
are you watching for in the Democrats quarter yeah I mean to understand what's happening on the Democratic Side in New
29:14
Hampshire you kind of have to go back in time a year a year ago after the midterm elections the Democratic National
29:21
Committee the political arm of the democratic party which is functionally controlled by the White House made the
29:27
announ ment that they wanted to switch the order of the states voting in the presidential primary if you remember Joe
29:32
Biden made the decision to have South Carolina vote first and really in doing so diminish the importance of Iowa and
29:39
New Hampshire on the Democratic side now when he made that decision a year ago New Hampshire Democrats were warning the
29:45
party that they would not be able to comply with that decision because their state law requires them to be the first
29:53
Primary in the country lo and behold a year later New Hampshire Democrats prediction was true the state has
29:59
scheduled their primary first in the nation as their state law requires and come Tuesday they will hold a Democratic
30:05
presidential primary what's different is that President Joe Biden will not be participating in this primary because
30:11
it's not sanctioned by the dnc's New Order and so he will not appear on the ballot but president bren's Challengers
30:18
the long shot Challengers like Dean Phillips like Maran Williamson they are all appearing on the ballot we just put
30:25
the White House in the Biden campaign and Dem RS nationally in a kind of conundrum they want to honor their new
30:31
state order and make clear that South Carolina is the first place where their presidential primary officially starts
30:37
but at the same time they're seeking to avoid the embarrassment of one of Biden's Challengers mainly Dean Phillips
30:44
who's invested a lot of money in the state of New Hampshire to finish above Joe Biden and possibly create bad
30:50
headlines or create a sense that this President is suffering from a lack of enthusiasm within his own party so in
30:56
light of those facts Democrats in the state have tried to create a wrin campaign around Joe Biden encouraging
31:02
New Hampshire Democrats to write in the president's name on Tuesday's ballot so he can finish above all of those other
31:10
Challengers even though his name is not appearing on the ballot and that's been the thing that's been happening over the
31:15
weekend some democratic surrogates like Boston mayor Michelle woo or Congressman roana of California have spent their
31:22
weekend in New Hampshire rallying and doing get out the vote efforts encouraging people to write in Joe
31:28
Biden's name on the primary ballot so this matters for Biden narratively but does it matter in terms of delegates
31:34
like how much does this race actually matter in real practical terms for Biden yeah it's way more about the narrative
31:40
than it is about the actual logistic delegates that lead someone to be the Presidential nominee because since the
31:46
DNC is not recognizing the New Hampshire primary this is frankly just a kind of
31:51
state contest that media and voters will follow but will not actually matter in terms of the delegates that count at the
31:57
Democratic National Convention that officially nominates the person to be president that all starts in South
32:03
Carolina what is happening here is more about perception is more about vibe
32:09
there is a narrative out there that's been driven via polling and some of our reporting that Joe Biden struggles
32:16
within his own party and within the lack of enthusiasm on core constituencies the White House wants to nip that narrative
32:22
in the bud and one of the ways they think they can do that is by a strong showing on Tuesday by this rideing
32:29
campaign right so you mentioned Vibe and to that point we spent part of our day on Saturday at this house party in
32:35
conquered New Hampshire can you describe this house or the yard this is a real like Colonial Northeast home we have a
32:43
lot of yard signs that say Ry in Joe Biden and we have some Biden hair signs
32:49
also on the lawn there's like at least 30 lawn signs I'd say yeah I'm I'm just
32:55
selling it I'm not yeah yeah I mean this was um one of the get out the vote efforts that Democrats have scheduled
33:01
over this weekend to encourage New Hampshire Democrats to write in Joe Biden in Tuesday's primary and this one
33:07
was interesting I mean Congressman Rana of California was there there was a lot of um uh State Democrats from New
33:13
Hampshire who were there what we need to do everyone needs to do on Tuesday I'm
33:18
going to go out and I'm going to write in Joe
33:24
Biden and I'm going to remember to fill in the bubble by the side by by his name
33:29
and every one of you needs to do that as well and make sure that your friends and neighbors are doing that you know after
33:35
the speeches roana held a gaggle with the media where he took questions about the campaign and I decided to ask him
33:43
you spent so much time here talking to people about the dnc's decision I just want to know your personal like was that
33:48
a mistake for the DNC to switch the order and kind of leave New Hampshire out to dve was it a mistake that the Democrats changed the state order
33:55
considering now they've left President Biden at risk of a kind of embarrassing resol I think we'll have plenty of time
34:01
uh after this cycle to make sure that we have the diversity of this nation
34:06
represented and my view is that having uh the four states New Hampshire South Carolina Nevada Michigan all having a a
34:15
critical role uh is important and I I think the DNC will figure out how to do that but come Tuesday there is a risk
34:21
that President Biden finish you know you're here doing a campaign for him to not have that moment of embarrassment on Tuesday wasn't mistake for them in this
34:28
cycle to switch the order in the way that they did what I believe is that the
34:34
president's motives of wanting to elevate the voices of uh uh of black and
34:40
and brown communities uh was correct they that motive in terms of what what motivated uh him but it has to be done
34:48
also with recognizing the history and tradition of New Hampshire so that no
34:53
one's delegates get disqualified and I think that we will work to towards that uh that outcome but you know when 40% of
35:02
uh of people who were enslaved came through the Port of Charleston and the president is saying that we have to have
35:07
a recognition of that history in this country and that that voice has to matter I think people even in New
35:13
Hampshire recognize the importance of that but that we also have to recognize the 100-year history here and the
35:19
history of Civic activism and the the primary challenge of the order is really
35:26
the the challenge for the country how do we Embrace voices that have been excluded while also appreciating the
35:33
strength of our traditions and those are not easy questions and but I believe our
35:39
party will work it out by 2028 and for now I think whether it's New Hampshire
35:45
Nevada South Carolina or Michigan will'll all be unified uh behind Joe Biden would you ever I'm certainly
35:51
watching it to see how it ends up but it's not going to tangibly matter in the race for the the Democratic nomination
35:58
which you know is not much of a race at all at least to this point this is
36:04
exciting though we're we're a primary Day first in the nation yeah is it exciting are you excited yeah I mean I'm
36:11
excited in the same way that like I think
36:16
um before Iowa I was really exhausted with the idea of talking about how
36:21
people were going to vote without them voting and so one thing that I
36:27
appreciate about these days is you know we can talk less about polling and more
36:33
about how people really Express themselves and you know the funny thing
36:38
is I thought we would get like a bunch of these kind of primary days in the next couple months but because of the
36:44
unity of the message that we've been getting from Republicans we might have to we might have to savor this one
36:50
considering invite be one of our final competitive primary days
