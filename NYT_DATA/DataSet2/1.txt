Biden Is Winning the Money Race. Does It Matter?


0:00
one thing I've learned about presidential campaigns is that you'll almost never catch a candidate in New
0:06
York City unless of course they need to raise some
0:12
money and last week that was the case when three US presidents Biden Obama and
0:19
Clinton all gathered at Radio City Music Hall for what the Biden campaign called
0:24
quote the most successful political fundraiser in American history and we just have to take the
0:31
word for it in part because we weren't able to get in but here's the gist tickets started at $250 on the lowend
0:39
and $100,000 on the high-end which got you a photo with all three presidents an
0:45
entrance to a private reception there were performances by Queen Latifa lizo and an appearance from
0:52
Steven coar in the end the campaign says it raised more than $25
0:58
million but this wasn't just another gathering of the Rich and Famous it's an
1:03
example of something the Biden campaign has done really well courting big donors
1:08
and just in general raising a lot of money in February alone the Biden
1:15
campaign and the Democratic party raised $53 million bringing their total cash on
1:21
hand as of the beginning of March to $155 million that's more than 50 million
1:27
ahead of where Donald Trump and the RNC say their current fundraising totals are
1:33
which theoretically should allow Biden's campaign to build out a more robust
1:38
operation than their opponents but to this point Biden's money Advantage is yet to solve his
1:45
political problems like weak poll numbers against Trump continued concerns
1:50
about his Advanced age and the enduring critiques of the administration's role in the war in Gaza that cropped up at
1:57
Radio City when activists disrupted the event several times so with the general election in
2:04
its early stages I wanted to check in on the dollars and since of
2:09
2024 on Biden's impressive totals Trump's financial situation and all the
2:15
things Money Can't by today it's all about the
2:20
Benjamins from The New York Times I'm missad hearon this is the
2:27
runup so I've been going to political fundraisers for over two decades and I
2:33
will tell you that night was electric I wanted to talk with someone who did get in to that Radio City Event indulge me
2:41
with some like uh Snoopy questions like did you see anybody cool were the big or were the like biggest celebrities the
2:47
presidents themselves um well without a question you know the biggest celebrities were the presidents this is
2:54
Robert wolf he sat in the orchestra I have to admit you know for me I went
2:59
with my wife wife and it felt like a great date night you know we you know uh we don't come to the city all that often
3:05
and so it was great to see you know Queen Latifa before and and lizo and and
3:11
Ben Platt and people that you know I wouldn't necessarily go see perform and obviously Cole beer as the moderator you
3:18
know he's going to be funny right there's a lot of tongue and- cheek there so for me it was kind of like it was
3:24
just a fun night wolf is a prolific Democratic fundraiser and Wall Street veteran most of my career I was on Wall
3:31
Street at Solomon Brothers for about a decade and then I moved to UBS where I
3:37
was there uh 18 years as the former CEO and chairman of the Americas and uh
3:43
president and COO of the Investment Bank globally wolf was an early fundraiser for Obama an informal adviser to his
3:51
presidential campaign and like a lot of big donors he later served in Obama's
3:57
administration including on the economic recovery Advisory board after the 2008
4:02
financial crisis he's also what's been called a bundler I can't say I I love
4:08
the uh the name but um bundler is you you you raise money and then you raise
4:15
other people so let's just say I am going to an event and I ask 10 other
4:21
people to give you know 10 grand each and they do then Robert wolf will have
4:27
not only his 10 grand assigned to him but also that extra hundred grand and if
4:33
you raise x amount of money you get invited to fun things it's a way to
4:38
supercharge your ability to donate as an organizer of other people's money along with your own correct got it and I'm not
4:44
a bundler today now wolf serves on the Biden campaigns National finance
4:50
committee an elite group of some of its biggest donors so he's well known in Democratic
4:55
circles and is well appreciated for his insights and his wallet I thought he
5:01
would be a good person to give me the lay of the land when it comes to big money in politics how does it work and
5:07
what should we expect when it comes to big donors and President Biden so I had the honor of seeing President Biden um
5:15
where I was able to chat with him in January at a fundraiser in New York City for me I'm not there to ask for anything
5:23
okay I'm there to thank him to let him know you know thank him what he's doing on gun violence or thank him what he's
5:29
doing with respect to Ukraine uh my wife and I how does that how much money does that take it was expensive can I know
5:36
how much I think I think we wrote a check that
5:42
night it was high I think I like I just don't know what the scale of high is I
5:48
mean listen you can write checks as low as a dollar $10 I think we wrote a check
5:54
for like 50,000 for that dinner okay we've we've spent money on politics over
6:01
the last 20 years I I was one of the question I have is just how much have you spent do you think an Aggregate and
6:08
is there a single thing is there is the $50,000 the most you've written for a thing no what's the most one check
6:14
you've written I think it was 100,000 for what campaign uh Hillary's for Hillary's yeah and how much do you think
6:20
you've probably given an aggregate um you know I I think you can
6:26
look at the non-p pack side or non-committee side I mean my guess is in
6:32
aggregate I mean my guess is in excess of a million dollars we've given how did you get into Political like giving and
6:40
fundraising period Well I appreciate that um you know back in the early 2000s
6:47
for the most part it was called fire Finance insurance and real estate and if you looked at everyone giving the top
6:55
people the top companies were either Finance insurance or real estate at that time time you know I was a senior
7:01
executive at UBS you know being on Wall Street being a senior executive it got you the opportunity to meet a lot of
7:07
people so I got involved early uh specifically with the carry campaign okay I was anti-bush I was against the
7:14
War I had two young boys and I just felt like at that time you know it's not the
7:20
direction I wanted to go and so I got very active with Carrie and then it's the list you can't get off of if you can
7:27
get me off of let me know how but it's the GI that keeps on giving and then I hosted the first fundraiser for
7:33
president then Senator Obama in New York in March of 07 we you know raised a ton
7:39
of money and I became one of his biggest fundraisers nationally again and like I
7:44
guess does that just like do you just text your phone and say hey I have this politician I think he's really
7:50
interesting like what's actually the process of translating your interest in somebody to like a larger group and then
7:57
the money part too yeah so is it interesting in 2007 you know most of the
8:03
democratic party was all in Hillary I was able to meet Obama I aligned with a
8:08
lot it was like that that you know you know broard we're we're both Ivy guys we
8:14
both like sports his mother died of cancer my dad was going through Cancer all those things he was against the the
8:19
war part was big too espe and then and then against the war and so what happened was I just invited people like
8:27
hey you should meet this guy and they all knew of him from the 2004 convention and so you know with his
8:33
famous speech you know it's not red state blue state where the United States so on so forth and so what happened was
8:40
I became that guy you know people at law firms wanted to meet him even if it was just to meet him or get their book
8:46
signed that he had Audacity Of Hope or um take a picture with him people wanted
8:52
to get to know this guy and it was a cheap date back then it was only like
8:58
$2,100 that's and so they're like you could they could meet them at at a fairly accessible price exactly is it
9:05
access driven like when you're saying people want to find sign a book they want to meet them like what is the incentive if if we're thinking about why
9:12
people want to give I mean politics is an aphrodesiac right you're the most powerful person in the world at that
9:19
time you know most people did not get the opportunity to meet a president in their life and here's a possibility to
9:26
meet someone that could become the president I get what you're saying you're saying particularly when you were getting started what you were what you
9:32
were able to connect people with is an ability to meet people they wanted to and uh uh and they have the means and
9:38
access to be able to do it through you yeah I mean I became kind of that guy I mean I guess again I'm still thinking
9:44
kind of broadly before we talk about Biden specifically um what is the brand like for Democrats among Wall Street
9:50
right now and how has that shifted maybe over the time in which we're talking y you know I think it was always about 40%
9:58
were staunch Democrats 40% were staunch Republicans because of
10:03
Reaganomics which is when I started Wall Street in the 80s and 20% would go
10:08
either way and that that's kind of surprising to me I think of that as more of a republican crowd maybe it's not
10:14
because you know there's a lot of other issues important to them and not everyone votes with their pocketbook I
10:19
know that they think they view us as a as banksters instead Bankers but um you
10:26
know what I would say is that um I would say when it was U McCain Obama it was
10:32
clearly Obama got I'd say 100% of the 20% MH um when it was Romney Obama I
10:39
would say Romney was the majority of Wall Street he was kind of a Wall Street
10:44
guy knew him all um I think with Clinton and Trump in my opinion I think Hillary
10:50
and Bill you know just are so well-liked in New York and um and I my gut tells me
10:57
there were Republicans that went her way not for Trump as well um and then on the
11:03
Biden Trump it's hard to even assess because it was such a crazy period there
11:08
was no real campaign yeah I mean I was going to ask you about that and I guess I'm asking about right now too is there
11:15
a since I you know I've heard you previously talk about the ways that you think the progressive wing of Democrats
11:21
has become too anti-wall street I'm wondering where you view the Biden Democratic party on that question and do
11:27
you think that the party right now makes it easy for you to pitch them to your fellow Wall Street folks I mean honestly
11:34
I don't think we're front and center wall Street's not who it was and what it was you know you can raise money from
11:41
anywhere you know in almost any sector there is I mean media companies and
11:47
everyone you know tech companies you know I don't have to tell you how many firms now Lo yeah I guess that's part of
11:53
what I'm asking has small dollar donations has the ability to raise money from other groups grass Ro are are it's more
12:00
important to get Grassroots money than you know my Couple Grand or whatever I give a little more than that but um you
12:08
know what I would say is that first of all Wall Street wants to give their economic view they don't like
12:15
necessarily to get in the middle of the Riff Raff because I think they're nervous about being the the meme or
12:20
being in a polarizing environment with their employees right I I I think um
12:27
voting is very um personal today and there is no generic Wall Street voter
12:34
anymore this idea that you know you know the progressive thinks that wall
12:39
Street's voting with their pocketbook I think's BS um you know they may care about climate more than the progressives
12:46
care about climate or they may care about gun reform gun reform for me is front and center my wife works at Sandy
12:52
Hook promise on gun violence prevention and mental health and so gun gun violence for me is front and center so y
12:59
one isue voters in the same okay yeah I would say there is no one isue voter it used to be because of Reaganomics right
13:05
taxes right or anti-regulation that's changed dramatically you know the other
13:11
thing and this was going to get to kind of Biden specifically is like are we have been talking to so many people about how this election puts them in a
13:18
kind of pickle because for the majority of Americans they want you know they talk about wanting other options or just
13:24
being not happy with having the same options again when you're in those
13:29
circles How is how's like kind of your community feeling about Biden right now which Community I'm yeah that's a good
13:36
question CU I have two sons in their late 20s and that would CU about that would be a very different conversation
13:42
we could we I would have that answer but I'm really specific to I was thinking specific to fundraisers like is it easy
13:48
to raise money for Biden right now the answer is yes it's easy because
13:55
um there's now a campaign okay it's Trump vers Biden um and President Biden
14:02
was not candidate Biden so this whole idea of democratic bed wers or hey he's
14:09
got to get out I was totally the other way I in my opinion you know that that
14:16
transition to becoming more of the candidate took place at the State of the Union and that State of the Union in my
14:23
opinion I thought he was fantastic I think he has a hop in his step I love
14:28
that he's now out and about I like that kamla vice president Harris I'm sorry I've known her a long time I think I
14:35
love that she's out and about and now we're in a campaign people are more active and engaged yeah I I I it's
14:41
interesting you're um I like that you're pointing to State of the Union as that hinge point because I did feel like there was like the bed wedding had
14:48
reached its peak right before then right like there was whether it was the uh age questions from the special Council
14:54
whether it was a kind of polling the calls I was getting I want to hear
14:59
I to hear like what were people were people do you are you someone who feels The Angst when people are angsty it was
15:05
insane I was getting calls you know why is he running do you think he should run hey he's running let's not even have
15:12
that discussion let's talk about he's running and who he's going to be competing against and let's put all of
15:18
our inner anxiety into helping him win but I was Fielding calls non-stop
15:24
because listen people were seeing you know president Trump and Nikki Haley
15:29
they were in campaign mode yeah so yes I was Fielding it Asad nonstop age
15:35
specifically or other stuff I think other stuff I I think age I think there
15:40
was just you know listen there was a nervousness you know can anyone beat
15:46
Trump the answer is yes and now we're in a situation where it's much more mono
15:51
Amano and we now have choices to make and forget about what was let's look at
15:57
what is um has something different then yeah why aren't your sons convinced my
16:03
sons are very convinced okay that they will be voting for President Biden versus president Trump but we were
16:10
talking you and I about the excitement and the issues yeah you know our dinner table issues are about you know you know
16:18
Gaza and humanitarian there's a big debate going on in the genz generation
16:23
versus the older generation there's a debate going on you know on climate action vers I'm for I'm glad that we're
16:30
energy independent like these debates are becoming talked about more and more often because I said to you this idea
16:38
that democracy's on the line or these cultural issues are more front and center they are more front and center I
16:43
would have never thought when I was 27 or 29 and a half years old like my boys I don't think about the things they
16:50
think about today because you know they weren't front and center to me I one
16:57
question I have is like do you see what you do in terms of raising money as as
17:02
helping them get there to kind of close that enthusiasm Gap like how do you actually view the role of like
17:09
fundraising versus the work that they have to do to pull this off money's critical let's not underestimate that
17:16
yes both sides will be able to have a lot of money but getting out the vote
17:23
getting data having the right research being both on paid media and promoting
17:29
media you know having a bunch of people work with the Grassroots that's important to think that politics isn't
17:36
local to think that you can you know you can do this you know national campaign
17:42
and win that's complete BS people are tuning out you know you know most people
17:47
cut the cord so the people that you have to get to you got to be local so I'm like this idea that raising 26 million
17:54
is anything other than fantastic is ridiculous interesting cuz you know right now there's a lot of talk about
18:00
how Trump Can't Raise A lot of money how much do we think a money Advantage matters how much does a money
18:06
disadvantage matter you know Donald Trump has no problem getting on media right like he has no problem in that type of space what do you think the
18:12
money Advantage can do for Biden what do you hope it so I think there's a bunch to unpack there um yes Donald Trump in
18:20
some ways owns the airwaves you wake up to him you go to sleep to them but those are National Airwaves that's not where
18:27
voting gets done so the answer is yes it's important to localize the campaign
18:33
it's important to tell someone in a certain area what they're how they're helping your wages or how they're
18:39
helping you know with with climate action or why you know it's important that you're doing you know red flag laws
18:46
in certain States on on gun violence the second part I would say is don't
18:52
underestimate president Trump he's going to be able to raise his money you know I've said this the other day maral Lago
18:58
is not something homeless shelter okay so it's not like he doesn't have billionaires okay sitting there can't
19:05
the rumors of trump is broke are over blow I mean that that's complete BS right because you're going to have you
19:11
know his tax policy is going to be front and center and so these billionaires you
19:17
know that some do vote onedimensional they're going to make sure that he's got
19:23
money to run on MH it's yeah this is helpful because a lot of what we're reading now is about the lack of funds
19:29
you're saying you trust that in the end maybe it's because of tax policy or just because of like you know of people's
19:35
investment in Republicans he folks will give to him I think listen I I want to be clear here I think President Biden's
19:43
going to out raise him I think we're going to outwork him and I think having money early is important for building
19:49
offices I he what you're saying but if you're telling me that we don't think that there's going to be money at the RNC of the Republican party for a
19:57
presidential election where the Senate's important and the house is important we're kidding ourselves yeah yeah when
20:03
you look about the next six months is there a thing that worries you the most for the prospect of Biden getting
20:09
reelected listen I think if it's President Biden versus former president Trump I think we're in a good seat I
20:16
don't think there's more people voting for president Trump than in the past and I think it would be less I am worried
20:23
about the third party situation because we saw what happened with secretary Clinton there was no question the third
20:29
party impacted secretary Clinton and so yeah I'm nervous of what a third party
20:36
can how it impacts us and if I asked the most brilliant people or pollsters in
20:42
the world they could not give me an answer because they don't know we don't know so yeah I I I'm a Wall Street guy I
20:48
buy and sell things I don't live great in this gray area Okay I just don't do
20:54
you and this is kind of a last question I'm like you know citizens united super pack there was so much talk about the
21:00
influence of money in politics like what's your assessment of it like do you think do you think campaigns are too
21:05
expensive do you think there's too much money in it do you think that maybe money doesn't matter as much as folks saying and you know it's all a little
21:12
overblown no yes there's way too much money in it it's insane we're going to spend billions and billions of dollars
21:19
on this presidential election and yeah there's too much money in it and for some it's transactional being an
21:26
ambassador being this that's not where I am but I guess to most people this is
21:32
the most important thing that they think about you know every four years so you
21:37
know it seems like it's too much money at it but then again if you're saying the most important thing that happens
21:44
every four years I don't know it doesn't seem that money much versus our annual GDP yeah yeah I hear what you're say um
21:51
well thank you I appreciate your time thank you for joining us thank you much appreciated after the break the other
21:58
side of the money race after talking to Robert wolf I
22:04
wanted to get a bigger picture of the role of money in this race especially on the Republican side where Trump has been
22:11
lagging behind in donations while facing mounting legal bills there's also the
22:16
$175 million Bond he just paid the social media company going public and
22:22
those $60 Bibles he started selling um well thank you for joining us sorry
22:29
like no it's all good it's all good you're just allergic to me um can you so I brought in my colleague Shane goldmacher National political
22:35
correspondent for the times and the person I usually go to when I have questions about money and politics I
22:42
started by asking him what to make a Biden's big money advantage and Trump's
22:48
Financial struggles it's a big gap and I think the issue isn't just the size of the Gap right now it's the potential
22:55
size of the Gap in the coming months because by all accounts Democrats are expected to raise more money in the
23:01
coming months than Republicans are so that's the Gap now and it's expected to get even bigger oh wow throughout the
23:06
rest of the race what is the cause of it I mean one of them is just like a general structural cause which is the
23:12
candidate who's sitting in the White House tends to enter the general election with more money why is that just because people like giving money to
23:18
the president some of it is people like giving money to the president the more important is that they've controlled the party apparatus for the 3 years leading
23:26
up to the beginning of the general election and so Joe Biden has been raising money with the Democratic party
23:31
for basically a year at this point and it gives you an advantage because Trump was Raising in much tinier increments
23:38
just to fight through the primary you know just to give you a sense of scale during the primary Donald Trump was
23:44
Raising $3,300 increments to win that Republican primary that's the most he could raise from an individual person
23:50
into his campaign account Joe Biden was going around the country and raising in this big Mega committee that he shares
23:55
with the Democratic party 929 $9,000 increments and so you end up with
24:01
a lot more money if you can raise in that big of a chunk you're able to ask for more you're able to ask for more you have smaller donors that you can then
24:06
fund by using those bigger contributions to advertise to get more small donors it sort of builds upon itself interesting
24:12
why does it cost so much and increasingly cost more for these campaigns I mean theoretically these are
24:18
two candidates the country knows these aren't people who have name recognition problems why exactly are campaigns so
24:24
expensive I mean the number one answer is television ads or the digital version of Television ads and look you can spend
24:33
an enormous amount of money on television really really quickly just think about Mike Bloomberg's campaign
24:39
when he ran for president right he ran for president for only a few months and he spent basically a billion dollars he
24:46
was blanketing the television ads for a period but it is a reminder of how high up that number can run if you're buying
24:52
as many TV ads as you can it's basically an unlimited amount of spending that can
24:58
go and so like what is the driver the driver's television ads first and foremost and digital ads that now run on
25:04
television right like a lot of people are streaming but yeah running advertising is the overwhelming cost
25:09
everything else you hear about our field program our ground game it tends to be fractions of the dollar spent on
25:16
advertising on interesting so what is driving that big advantage that you're talking about do we know where the money
25:21
Gap is coming from is Biden have a specific Advantage among small donors big donors like how would we break down
25:27
why he has so much more money on hand I think there's important to think about
25:32
in two time frames the first is right now and I think he has more money right now because he's been tapping those
25:38
bigger institutional donors those people can give large chunks of money the big Radio City thing we saw last week
25:44
correct right that they had 5,000 people in the room so there's a lot of smaller donors you know what there were it's also people raising or giving $100,000
25:51
that they were're going to get a picture with the presidents right the next day he had a smaller Gathering of 175 of his
25:57
donors in New York City those people got sort of personalized briefings from the entire senior campaign team how much did
26:04
that cost you you had to I think at least given 47,000 something dollars
26:09
right that is the entry level the highest tier for his bundlers $ 2.5 million wow now if you're raising $2.5
26:16
million you might not be going to a big group briefing you might be getting the President visiting your house right on a fundraiser but there's enough people
26:23
that at a roughly $50,000 limit you still have $170 of them coming to New
26:30
York for that personalized briefing so your first question where is his Advantage right now it's a lot of these
26:36
major donors right they have been tapped they've built out a whole system Joe Biden Jill Biden K Harris Doug mhof
26:42
they've been traveling around the country at events and scooping up big checks right in the coming months though
26:49
there's a wider expectation that Joe Biden's Advantage will be driven by smaller donors online that online
26:55
Democratic giving has become almost most habitual for Liberal donors who are
27:01
amped up about an election even about the candidates they may not be excited about they give tons of money right key
27:07
Senate races are flooded with money each cycle and whether the democrat's a household name or not they end up
27:13
raising a lot of money and there's a wide expectation that online even if Democrats aren't enthused
27:20
about Joe Biden they're going to be enthused about giving money to stop Donald Trump okay okay let's focus now
27:25
on Donald Trump someone who famously uh has a lot of money until he doesn't why is he struggling in fundraising so
27:33
much consideringly he has historically done well with small dollar donors and it seems like what you're saying those
27:39
donations are slowing down why is that do we know yeah I mean I let me say give you an answer I want to take one little
27:45
step back which is that like Trump is facing multiple different Financial challenges all at once it's hard to keep
27:53
them straight it is hard to keep them straight so number one you're talking about is like politics like how much money does he have in his campaign
27:58
account and some of that is look he just got through a nominating contest and he was raising money and spending money to
28:05
win the nomination now less than maybe some others have before usually at the end of that you end up with a little bit
28:10
less and you have to build up okay and he hasn't had that joint agreement with the Republican party until just now
28:16
basically to raise those bigger chunks of money in fact he's doing that uh just this coming week he has a big event in
28:22
Palm Beach that they've said they're going to raise 25 $30 million I think they put out the number of $33 million
28:27
from from a single dinner because he's getting all these people who have not given till now they're going to come and
28:33
you know a couple right each member of the couple gives $800,000 that's $1.6 million for that couple at that dinner
28:39
okay so this is his answer to Radio City this is his answer it's his coming out party for those Mega donor checks it's
28:46
just coming this week so the First Financial challenge is political and he just has less money than Joe Biden does
28:53
the second one is his legal bills and he has been spending now we've reported more than $100 million since he left the
28:59
White House on legal bills and the pot of money he's been tapping for that mostly has been this money raised in the
29:06
aftermath of the 2020 election and that money's almost all gone at this point is that a different pot than the money he
29:13
was spending to win the primary it is a completely different pot so what happened is at the end of 2020 he loses
29:21
the election and he says please give to me dear supporters this thing was rigged
29:26
and there's no evidence this yet I'm going to fight this in the courts I'm going to fight it everywhere I can my election defense fund and Republican
29:32
donors gave more money to Donald Trump in the postelection period of 2020 than
29:38
almost any period they gave during the actual campaign that is so wild they were so you know denying the election
29:45
result paid off for him he raised $250 million online between the day after the
29:53
election and the day that Joe Biden was inaugurated so he spent some of that money fighting recounts or whatever but
29:58
you know what he pocketed most of that money not personally pocketed but he put it in a political action committee and that huge chunk of funds paid has been
30:07
paying his lawyers ever since then and so that money has been spent down slowly
30:13
slowly Now quickly and quickly and the total amount of money left in the account that's been doing that save
30:19
America it's his political action committee is less than $5 million at this point okay so he's basically tapped out that post 2020 surge of money that
30:26
he got through people giving being out of the election denial space correct okay and so he's facing not just a
30:33
political shortfall versus Joe Biden but this legal fund that he's been using to pay his lawyers that's also going to be
30:39
in a shortall and by the way he's going on a trial soon yeah the costs don't go down typically when you go on a criminal
30:45
trial yeah the legal problems have no signs of slowing in terms of what he has to owe correct so the first one is that
30:50
political the second is this legal and the third one we have a little bit of resolution right now but it has been a big one has been like the bond he had to
30:57
post in order to keep all of his businesses active during his Appeal on one of the many cases he's faced which
31:02
is a civil fraud case in New York and that just went down from what I understand the times reported he poses
31:08
$175 million bond in his civil fraud case which means that the New York authorities can't seize his assets while
31:14
he's appealing that larger 450 million judgment against him can you just explain what that means in more simple
31:21
terms yeah the that third category is like can he keep his businesses and can they keep running in New York because
31:27
the risk was that if he could not pay that he would have to sell off the businesses to pay set judgment yeah so he has lost the case and he's appealing
31:34
that ruling and under New York law when you lose you still have to pay basically
31:40
the penalty and so he's saying the penalty is so big was $454 Million it's
31:45
so onerous that I can't even get a bond to do that and so that has been reduced so it's now $175 million and he has
31:52
since lined up money and so it's like a you're borrowing in order to appeal MH
31:57
and eventually look if he loses at the appeal pellet court level and he loses at the final final Court then he will
32:03
have to make an actual payment but for now he can borrow a bond to like St does that actual payment have to be 450 or
32:10
175 H as of now it's still the 450 but some of the legal experts say
32:17
the fact that the bond itself was being reduced is maybe a sign that eventually a final judgment could be shrunk but we
32:23
don't know yet no we previously talked to Maggie Haberman about how Trump's legal fees were basically consuming the
32:29
campaign in the way that you really just laid out for us but one thing I couldn't understand is like what are the possible
32:34
solutions he has to this I know we have seen some of the efforts with things like truth social his social media
32:40
company and other ways he been trying to maneuver I remember hearing about the RNC kind of having an open question about whether they would do it what is
32:46
his best shot to come up with some of these answers I mean the number one thing to remember is that he could of
32:51
course pay for his own lawyers with his own money he's chosen not to do so so far right he has chosen not to use his
32:58
own personal finances to pay for all these buckets are separate from Donald Trump's bank account like he could
33:03
choose to use his bank account to solve the issue that he's running out of money to pay his lawers he's just running out of other people's money it doesn't mean
33:09
that he doesn't have any an important reminder right like he has his own set of money that he has chosen not to use
33:15
to pay his lawyers in his multiple criminal cases because he had this big pot of money from 2020 so option one is
33:22
you just pay for them yourself there's other more complicated options like you
33:27
create a special legal defense fund and what are the rules around that if you're an active candidate for president there
33:33
are other ways he can raise money into the pack that has been paying the lawyers and in fact he's done a small
33:39
thing along those lines right there was a little float well will the RNC actually pay his legal bills and they' said no okay absolutely not but then
33:47
that that first mega committee we talked about you can raise those really big checks there's a sort of order of operations of who gets the money the
33:54
first always is the candidate right the candidate gets the money first typically second is the party like the national
34:00
the Republican National Committee but in this case Trump didn't actually put the party second he put his pack second
34:06
right and that pack has been paying his lawyers so we see Trump coming up with these sort of solutions at this point if
34:12
I were to give $100 to Donald Trump's campaign do we know how much of that is going to you know save America in the
34:20
legal fees versus how much is going to the actual job of winning an actual election yeah since early last year 10
34:26
cents of every dollar that's given online has gone to that save America account which is paid almost exclusively
34:32
for legal stuff and so yeah all those small donors it's 10% of what they've been giving for the last year which is
34:39
not an insignificant amount of money and it's helped pay for some of those look the intertwining of all these things is
34:45
real right like to differentiate what is the Trump legal issues with what is the Trump political issues is kind of it's a
34:52
Fool's errand right one of his lawyers was recently co-hosting
34:58
a fundraiser for his super pack right so like they're not totally separate they
35:05
have been separate in terms of like actual cash flow right the campaign has not spent money on his personal lawyers
35:12
but the idea that they're like separate things no I think it's very much the Donald Trump 2024 campaign is happening
35:19
in and around courtrooms I know this is a really unprecedented situation that we're in
35:26
but like are these rules made up as we go along or like that's an existential question yeah it is kind of I'm like
35:34
because we've never been here like is he just test casing new theories about how you use money in politics like is it
35:41
just completely Uncharted it's a little bit Uncharted it's also that it's not
35:47
just him right we're in basically 20 years of candidates testing new theories of how they want to spend and raise
35:53
money in politics and very little policing by the group that's to overse them so like There are rules
36:00
that Trump is taking advantage of that others have plowed before him there are rules that he's expanding but I would
36:06
say that this is not just a trump issue this is just the broader regime of campaign finance that how we run this
36:13
stuff is no longer a thing that makes intuitive sense okay to a regular
36:18
American you know I wanted to ask specifically about the truth social you know Trump media as he's turned into a
36:24
source of Revenue I've only been like kind of halfway following this storyline I guess like help me
36:30
understand how something can become such a campaign Bo or was it or has it been yeah so you know this is his private
36:37
social media company and it just went public and on paper Trump has become a
36:42
multi-billionaire in a way that he really hasn't been and so it's a dramatic increase in his wealth on paper
36:51
right this is a stock that when they have to also file all these official reports now that you're a publicly traded stock you have to reveal your
36:57
books and the books don't look like a multi-billion doll company right there's nothing in the books that it's like $4.1
37:03
million of Revenue last year that screams multi-billion dollar company but what it does have is supporters who are
37:09
buying this stock online and driving up the price and we've seen this not just for Trump we saw it in like all these meme stocks around GameStop AMC right
37:17
and it Bears a lot of similarity like the actual finances don't Merit the valuations that it has on the market but
37:23
it is valued at what it's valued at now Trump is the biggest shareholder and so again multi-billion dollar windfall but
37:30
he can't sell those shares yet there's a bunch of rules about how long he has to wait and so all of this is really like
37:35
theoretical money for him and certainly very theoretical in terms of the campaign I would actually pretty much
37:42
wall that off because for now that isn't money he has access to and it's not
37:47
expected to immediately impact the campaign so that doesn't impact those initial three buckets but it gives him a money on paper that he can possibly
37:54
leverage to solve one of his many other problems Hope on Horizon got you got you uh what about these $60 bibles are we
38:01
should should we just expect like a level of trump gimmick to raise money
38:06
like I guess I I look at those things and he's always felt someone willing to grift to sell to do whatever he needs to
38:14
is your sense that we're entering a a moment of desperation for them how should I read the Bibles I wouldn't read
38:20
it as something different in kind right like you go back to 2016 when he was
38:25
winning those competitive primaries he had Trump branded stuff all around him he was using that as a sales pitch
38:31
opportunity he went to Sneaker Con to roll out his own set of sneakers right
38:37
he has rolled out his own picture book yeah a Bible is I guess you know just the next step in the journey the Bible
38:43
is just I mean you know it's hard to say it's just the next step it's certainly a step right but we've been on this
38:49
pathway for a long time right Trump selling his name to sell things and make a profit and again this is money for him
38:55
personally this is not a Bible that you buy it from his campaign that the campaign this is just like a personal
39:00
private business deal that he's entered into oh this isn't even helping these buckets this is just helping his own individual bank account which he is not
39:06
famously tapping to pay the lawyers or for his campaign right he has not put money in his own political campaign
39:14
basically since he became the nominee in 2016 he relied on donors and the Republican party ever since that was
39:20
such a huge part of his brand when he was running in 2016 was like I am not owned by these people I mean you talk to
39:26
voters all the time it is still part of his brand Republican voters bring this up all the time this exactly what I was
39:33
going to say is like it's amazing how that brand has lasted you know but it hasn't an our reporting seeped into
39:39
anyone and I was going to ask you have you heard someone think oh a Donald Trump with less money is a less
39:45
appealing Donald Trump I mean I think some of this is just sort of the media silos and what is the information that
39:51
you're consuming but I think on a regular basis in traveling in in Iowa New Hampshire and other parts of the the
39:57
country this year last year during the primary voters would bring up his independence and say he doesn't need to
40:04
be running yeah he doesn't need the money that he is not beholden the way that Nikki Haley is beholden he's not
40:10
beholden the way that Ronda Sanz is beholden and meanwhile he is raising all the money from other people but it was
40:15
that initial spend that it was his own money and his vast claims of wealth and his idea that he doesn't need their
40:21
money even if he's taking it that has taken hold in such a real way that it's hard to overstate how important that's
40:28
been in his appeal I think not just to Republican primary voters but across the board yeah it is a core part of the
40:35
brand even if it's gotten further from the truth I want to ask like you know what are do you think are the long-term
40:40
impacts of this current cash crunch with Trump like when it comes to the campaign what will he not be spending money on
40:46
what will we not see from the campaign that otherwise if he was flush we would have seen you know we're talking a lot
40:53
about money but I think that money is often vastly overrated next question in
40:58
its importance in presidential elections in particular right I've covered house races and Senate races and and an
41:03
average house candidate running right they're not known in their Community even the best house candidates aren't
41:08
particularly well known so somebody comes and spends a million dollars on television ads that dominates the
41:14
average voters knowledge of those candidates with Donald Trump and Joe Biden a bunch of advertising isn't
41:21
introducing you to these two candidates you know who these candidates are you even know some of their positions on
41:27
issues right and so money is incredibly important in American politics it is
41:33
least important in the biggest races right I guess with that in mind then what does it do it does a few things I
41:41
mean the number one thing I think that it does is it allows the candidate or the campaign with more money to expand
41:48
the map of what they're looking at at presidential politics right if you are the Joe Biden campaign and you know that
41:56
Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are your absolute must-win States right you want to hold those three you hold those
42:02
three states and you win the one little Electoral College vote in Nebraska you can get reelected right but like that's
42:08
not where they're spending exclusively they're also spending in Nevada in Georgia in Arizona they just released a
42:14
memo about Florida they've releasing a memo about Florida but like let's see if they spend money in Florida right but like North Carolina which they lost last
42:21
time right even as he won by a relatively large Electoral College they are spending in a state that he lost by the most narrow margin
42:27
because they have enough right now to spread the map so right if you're the Democrats elections aren't usually won
42:34
in the winter spring before the election but you can get an edge right if you're Joe Biden you enter this campaign behind
42:40
in most public polling the money is allowing you to either close that Gap or build things like campaign offices that
42:47
can pay off over time but it's really the like how thin can you stretch the defenses of your opponent can you make
42:54
them need to spend money in North Carolina if you're Trump and take away from the state that he may otherwise
43:00
have to win right and so the speaking of the importance of this period of the race the place we have seen the Biden
43:06
campaign be the weakest is probably with enthusiasm among kind of core constitu they talk a lot about kind of bringing
43:11
people home right now and wanting to do that even more so than they think about persuasion or all that type of things
43:16
come later in the year when we think about the impact of money like how much love can money by like when you think
43:22
about the impact of that specifically the people who are probably Democrats but maybe soft on Biden is that ads that
43:29
they're supposed to convince them is that texts is that door knocking is I guess it's all of the above yeah I mean
43:36
I think that the most recent New York Times poll we did had Trump winning
43:41
97% of the people who voted for him in 2020 and had Joe Biden winning 83% of
43:48
the people who voted for him in 2020 that Gap tells you why Joe Biden was losing in that poll and so what they're
43:54
going to try to do is use their money advantage to tell that chunk of democratic voters this election is
44:00
coming and depending on the place give them a reason to care or to highlight their awareness right you know I live
44:07
this every day you live this every day this is not a central part of most people's lives and if you're an average
44:13
voter the whole promise of Joe Biden was partly I didn't need to care about politics every day right and so people
44:19
have intentionally tuned out and so they're trying to re-engage voters who might be likely to vote for Joe B but
44:27
not likely to be tuned into why they should care yet and sometimes that's advertising sometimes that's spending in
44:33
other ways that are trying to reach them but that is their chief goal and money is one of the ways they're trying to to
44:39
solve it thanks Shane I really appreciate it this was really helpful all right thank
44:45
[Music]
44:50
you as of Wednesday morning jce Shane and Robert predicted Republican
44:56
fundraising numbers were going up the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign announced that they'd
45:02
raised over $65 million in March ending the month with $93 million in cash on
45:09
hand the Biden campaign has yet to release its March total though a
45:14
campaign spokesperson said we can expect the numbers in the coming [Music]
45:25
days that's the runup for Thursday April 4th
45:31
2024 and now the rundown all right this morning counting votes in four states that had presidential primaries voters
45:38
in Wisconsin New York Rhode Island and Connecticut went to the polls on Tuesday
45:44
and although Biden and Trump won all those States easily there were warning signs for both campaigns on the
45:50
Republican side this primary is long over but look at the support for Nikki
45:55
Haley Nikki Haley won at least 10% of the vote in all four states despite
46:01
having dropped out of the race last month and on the Democratic side more than 45,000 people in Wisconsin voted
46:09
uninstructed that's the terminology people continue to voice their disagreement with Biden's handling of
46:14
the war in Gaza by staging a protest vote at The Ballot Box also this
46:22
week Donald Trump held rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin and in his speeches under crooked Joe Biden every
46:29
state is now a border state every town is now a Border Town his rhetoric about immigration escalated the 22-year-old
46:36
nursing student in Georgia who was barbarically murdered by an illegal alien animal uh the Democrats said
46:43
please don't call them animals they're humans I said no they're not humans they're not humans they're animals use
46:49
dehumanizing language about migrants but it's a border blood bath and it's destroying our country it's a very bad
46:56
thing happening and call it what's happening at the border a blood bath there are now 102 days till the
