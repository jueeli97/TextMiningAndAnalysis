Abortion, Trump and Religion in Politics



0:00
this is just my favorite kind of episode so you know you're doing the Lord's work my friend uhhuh that's what they tell
0:06
you right before they string you up from New York Times opinion I'm
0:13
Michelle coddle I'm Ross doit I'm Carlos Lozada and I'm Lydia pgreen and this is matter of
0:20
[Music]
0:28
opinion all right so this week abortion landed in the spotlight again reminding
0:34
us just how much the issue of Reproductive Rights continues to Rock American politics so I've gathered you
0:42
all here today for us to Noodle over whether the latest developments in the
0:47
fight over abortion access suggest religion is gaining or losing steam in
0:52
the political Arena but first someone's going to have to walk us through the latest uh Lydia you want to tackle this
0:58
for us I'm happy too well it was an action-packed week I mean we always knew
1:04
since the Supreme Court overturned Row in 2022 that abortion was going to play a huge role in the 2024 presidential
1:10
election obviously the Senate is up for grabs the house there's you know it's going to be a big big big issue it's a
1:15
lot it's a lot and so so this week uh you know Trump the you know Wy politician that he is took a big swing
1:23
at diffusing what has become I think a very difficult and toxic issue for his party and he announced on a video that
1:29
uh while he's proud to have helped dismantle roie Wade he believes that abortion should be left up to the states
1:34
he thought IVF needs to be protected and he he didn't explicitly say that he was against a national ban and there were a
1:40
lot of other details that he left out that give him lots and lots of wiggle room his favorite thing to have but uh
1:46
you know it was a big moment it happened on Monday and then on Tuesday the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a Draconian
1:53
ban on abortion that dated back to 1864 yes prood yeah pre-statehood
2:00
amazing yeah you know women couldn't vote back then as you might recall um so
2:05
just to be clear this ban was on the books in like you know 1968 and 1969
2:11
which is the reason that the Supreme Court had it revert the Supreme Court ruled that because of row the law that
2:19
was on the books in Arizona in 1969 or 1970 when women had the right to vote
2:25
dating back to which had originally been passed in 1864
2:31
repealed in20 1930 1940 or50 was I just
2:37
think it's useful to be clear that's all apprciate it for clarity very kind of
2:42
you so Arizona is of course a very important swing state so this this issue
2:47
instantly became a hot potato one of Trump's acolytes Carrie Lake who a couple of years ago said she loved this
2:53
very old law she's currently running for Senate in Arizona and she's tried to back away from it she didn't get any
2:59
help from from her fellow State Republicans cuz on Wednesday the uh Republican dominated State Legislature
3:05
blocked a democratic effort to repeal the 1864 law so you know that's about
3:10
where things are you know how when Trump and his supporters talk about the
3:16
economy under his watch during his presidency they always act as if 2020 didn't count right as if they can just
3:22
go back in time and kind of erase that year from his record as president on
3:28
abortion I see a sort of similar kind of time travel sort of depending on what audience he's trying to sway and you see
3:35
that clearly in that video statement like Lydia said he he doesn't Express support for a National Abortion ban he
3:42
also doesn't criticize sort of the proposed state level bans even if they're far more restrictive than his own prior stated preference for a ban
3:49
after 16 weeks but even Beyond those kind of policy specifics the rhetoric is
3:55
sort of very weirdly and artfully all over the map right he urges people to follow the their heart and their faith
4:01
which sounds kind of like it's a nod to Christian conservatives but then he also says do whatever is right for yourself
4:08
you know which sounds very very kind of pro- choices um I missed that in the Bible where it says that authentic
4:14
authentically Trump but yeah but what's what's clear is exactly is that Trump probably does not have hard and fast
4:20
views on abortion himself and says whatever he thinks will help him politically but that doesn't change the
4:25
fact that he's in a bind right he obviously sees that the efforts at a abortion restrictions post dobs have
4:31
been very unpopular but he also knows where his bread gets buttered on abortion and the hard thing about trying
4:36
to Signal different things to different audiences is that everyone can hear you at the same time that's true although
4:42
they sometimes hear you through different filters and that is worked to his Advantage a lot of it although in
4:49
this case there were some staunchly pro-life political players who were not pleased I mean Mike Pence and Lindsey
4:56
Graham and the Susan B Anthony folks were you know expressing their disappointment
5:02
over this but on some level does this matter if if they're unhappy with this
5:07
particular thing well that's I mean let me just uh I guess quasi defend the
5:14
specificity of Trump's views so afterward he was asked whether he would sign a National Abortion restriction
5:22
that crossed his desk and I believe he said no he would not so he didn't say that in the video but he did clarify it
5:28
when asked afterward and he also criticized the abortion law which you know reflects again a certain
5:34
incoherence he was saying States should do whatever they feel like they should do but then when a state law is
5:41
reinstated that he doesn't like he criticized it and Trump has been on the record criticizing the heartbeat bills
5:48
uh the kind that Ronda santz supported you know again not in this moment but in different contexts in the last year or
5:55
so so I think you can look at Trump and say pretty pretty clearly that Trump is
6:00
in a way a sort of classic conflicted voter on abortion again not that he has any kind of deeply felt views but you
6:08
could talk him into a 15we ban or a 20we ban and you probably couldn't talk him
6:14
into a six or eight-week ban and again without that being sort of his you know
6:19
his absolute position he sent enough signals I think that we can say that's where he actually is but do you actually
6:27
think you couldn't talk him in to pretty much anything I mean that's the problem with him and the problem with paying too
6:33
much attention to kind of what's in his heart really when you're talking about a
6:38
pure opportunist if the pressure from his Congressional team or from his base
6:46
was to go farther why wouldn't he I think if it was if it suddenly became
6:52
the case that uh heartbeat laws were very popular Across America and 60% of
6:57
the country supported them Donald Trump would absolutely support them but if you're trying to pressure him from the
7:04
pro-life side I don't think you have incredibly strong political leverage I
7:09
think it's very clear even before he came out with this statement that you know most Republican senators in
7:16
contested states were not themselves eager to pass a 16we ban or even a 20we
7:21
ban um so yes you could pressure him but for the pressure I think to radically shift his perspective the country as a
7:29
whole would have to shift pro- lifers would have to show that they could win some referenda for instance so in this
7:36
landscape I think Trump's positioning is likely to hold to some degree that would
7:43
be my guess the other thing that was notable to me was the the two sort of biggest political voices that came out
7:49
were Lindsey Graham and Mike Pence and Lindsey Graham is notable to me because of his incredibly poor track record of
7:56
sticking to it when he criticizes Trump right Falls like a cheap suit yeah no he really does and and Pence you know who I
8:02
think is someone who has very very deep conviction on this issue is so deep in the wilderness I mean he is the guy that
8:09
Trump put on the ticket to prove his his sort of fty to the pro-life position
8:15
it's just kind of remarkable you know how far exiled he is from the kind of Beating Heart of of the Republican party
8:22
today Trump's political needs are also very different now from the moment when he needed Pence or when he had like if
8:29
you go back 2016 you know he needed Evangelical voters not just to win the election to even secure the nomination
8:34
right and he needed Pence to kind of you know win people over he doesn't need
8:40
this voting base in quite the same way that he did back then he can be I don't
8:46
know if how to call him a conflicted voter like Ross does he can just be a sort of opportunistic politician so
8:52
there's been a lot of talk about whether or not Trump's going squishy on this is
8:57
going to cause a rift among his his white Evangelical supporters and I just find this almost
9:04
incomprehensible and I think in part it's because of how he has changed in terms of what he represents to those
9:11
white evangelicals I mean originally he was a tool right you know he was going to give them their justices on the
9:17
Supreme Court and he was going to give them their kind of death of row it was
9:24
very specific very transactional almost but over the past several years he has
9:30
become almost their Messiah if not their Messiah then at least their prophet he has leaned all in into that I am your
9:37
representative you are persecuted I am your Justice he has tapped into kind of
9:43
the the larger grievance of that Community to a degree that it it goes
9:49
Way Beyond the specifics of what he can actually deliver for them to where it is
9:55
it is a spiritual kind of connection with a lot of these folks and they are not going to aband he would have to do
10:00
something truly egregious for them to abandon him I think the most honest moment in Trump's video statement was
10:06
when he said you must follow your heart on this issue but remember you must also win elections right and so he recognizes
10:14
that even as he's become that figure for the pro-life movement he's very pragmatic about what it means for his
10:20
own Prospect and what you know the irony in this is that when it comes to the two candidates you know own views it's the
10:27
pro-choice Democrat who may be the one um who is the one with the more sort of religious and philosophical qualms about
10:33
abortion than compared to the Republican nominee but that doesn't matter right like Biden says that row basically had
10:41
it right and Trump beats his chest about being the one who got rid of row so evangelicals may you know you know Mike
10:48
Pence and Others May wonder you know how deeply they can trust Trump on abortion but they know they can't trust Biden and
10:54
so I don't see how it's going to you know have a significant any kind of erosion
10:59
of support for him especially since he's become this kind of Messianic figure
11:05
they can't trust Biden they also can't trust the voters right I mean the reality is that like row it turns out
11:11
May well be the compromis position on abortion right I mean that may be where America actually has landed on abortion
11:19
first of all I mean I think like talking about American evangelicalism as essentially a
11:25
Messianic cult for Donald Trump is a ridiculous over generalization about an incredibly diverse community of tens of
11:32
millions of people that honestly we would never make about any other group and in fact there are tons and tons of
11:38
evangelicals who have a to still have a totally transactional approach to their support for Donald Trump along the lines
11:45
that uh Carlos is suggesting where it's like look you know no matter what happens Joe Biden supports zero pro-life
11:52
policies he supports legislation that is well to the left of where row actually
11:58
was and so if if you are pro-life what you know what are you actually going to do you don't have to love Trump to sort
12:03
of have that perspective there's also the reality and this is why Trump did this now as opposed to four months ago
12:11
when he was still in a semi contested primary or four months from now when he will actually need prol lifers to vote
12:19
he did it now because elections are fought at the margins he didn't want to alienate Pro lifers during the primary
12:25
and he doesn't want to be seen as betraying them close to the ction when it would be you know high in their minds
12:31
Trump in a really tight election yeah he's obviously going to get 80 85% of the white Evangelical vote no matter
12:38
what but he could lose the election if 200,000 people in a few swing states are
12:44
pissed off about his abortion stat so there is some risk for him and again it's why he's doing it now and not
12:50
earlier or later so here's the question then we can see why Trump needs the white evangelic
12:59
Bas clearly but what about how like how is the era of trump impacting religious
13:06
conservatives and the conservative movement and their kind of role in politics more generally which Ross you
13:12
had some very deep thoughts on and I want you to unpack them after we take a quick break so stick with us everybody
13:18
and we'll be right [Music]
13:28
back [Music]
13:39
all right we're back Ross you wrote a column this week coming off of Trump's statement on abortion you want to walk
13:46
us through your thoughts on how all this connects to the challenges facing the pro-life movement and religious
13:53
conservatives In This Moment sure I'll just take an hour and 47 minutes and we
13:58
run you will be glued to you so trying to be very brief and glib we were talking
14:04
before about you know the extent to which the overturning of row and the
14:09
return of the issue to the States has pushed American politics in a more pro-choice Direction I think that's
14:15
somewhat true and evident but it's also true that if you look at polling on what
14:20
people think about abortion and whether people think it should always be legal or sometimes be legal and so on there's
14:27
a big shift that doesn't start in 2022 it starts in the mid-2010s around the
14:33
time that Donald Trump becomes the leader of the Republican party and I I argued in the column that there is some
14:40
connection here that essentially having if you are a idealistic and religiously
14:47
motivated movement that is trying to argue that you are defending the rights
14:53
of unborn human life while also promising to protect women in a vulnerable state having Donald Trump as
14:59
opposed to someone else as your standard Bearer makes that argument seem less
15:04
compelling to a lot of people who are on the fence about the issue um and I even
15:10
suggested it might make it less compelling to people who vote for Trump people might vote for Trump because he's
15:15
a tough guy and a hardass and is going to secure the southern border but they still wouldn't trust him to you know
15:22
figure out what you do about abortion ban exceptions for women who have
15:27
miscarried or to save the life of the mother and so on like would you trust Donald Trump to you know to to write
15:34
that kind of legislation you probably wouldn't so I think that is not both a
15:39
real sort of force affecting politics for the last 5 to seven years but also one that continues to be an issue right
15:46
I mean you write about the need to protect women in a vulnerable time but I I have to say that I'm pretty sure what
15:52
women want uh most women want is not male protection but the autonomy to make their own decisions and I don't know
16:00
that a politics that's based on will protect you in a vulnerable time is sort
16:06
of the need of the hour in this moment so I I actually think there are problems with both um as we sort of stare down
16:12
the 2024 election and I think neither of them is especially appealing to the people that he needs to convince to vote
16:17
for him I mean that's the pro-choice argument right and it may be that that argument just which by the way is winning
16:24
FYI all right I want to take I mean I'm just just wait wait wait wait just so
16:29
I'm I'm obviously quite aware that the pro-choice argument is winning and I never expected the overturning of roie
16:34
Wade to lead to abortion bans in more than a very few States and it was always clear that the pro-life perspective was
16:41
a minority perspective in American politics that said I'm naturally quite interested as someone who thinks that
16:47
it's wrong to kill unborn human beings in the womb in arguments and politics
16:52
that might persuade if not you my beloved fellow podcasters then at least
16:57
some people who are genu ly conflicted on the issue and I do think an argument that says we're here to help women and
17:04
children has a more plausible chance of making that persuasion than the kind of
17:09
arguments that Trump makes that's all I'm saying Ross your your column made
17:14
the point that the pro-life movement has become sort of deeply intertwined with
17:20
Donald Trump and that he's a a sort of lousy standard Bearer for a strident
17:26
pro-life case and I guess what I'm wondering is why in 2016 they had many
17:32
options they had many options who were you know more conventionally and
17:38
plausibly pro-life candidates I mean I think the argument that you can make is
17:44
that once Trump was President the pro-life movement should have let's say thrown their weight behind one of the
17:50
impeachment efforts and tried to get you know Mike Pence as president instead you could make that kind of argument I mean
17:57
Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were the two candidates of different flanks different
18:02
factions within the pro-life movement the sort of upper middle class whole food shopping PR lifers liked Rubio and
18:10
you know Iowa evangelicals liked Cruz and there you know if you go back and
18:15
look at sort of a lot of never you know a lot of different kinds of never trumpism but a lot of never trumpers
18:21
were were sort of in different parts of the pro-life part of the party Trump was
18:27
very successful at rally a different kind of voter and then once he was the nominee you had a combination of the
18:35
sort of binary Choice Dynamic of American politics with yeah some of the Dynamics that Michelle was talking about
18:41
earlier where you had parts of evangelicalism developed this kind of religious narrative around Trump
18:48
especially in sort of I think pentecostalist parts of uh American
18:53
Christianity and we talk about white evangelicals but in fact if you look at like Hispanic Republicans a lot of them
18:59
are pentecostalists so you know there's a lot of different Dynamics at play it's
19:05
partially being forced into it it's partially rationalizing something once you're forced into it it's partially the
19:11
kind of you know quasi religious bond that people form with their leaders it's a lot of different things at once if the
19:17
pro-life movement could wave the magic wand and make you know Ronda santis the Republican nominee most of them would
19:23
have um but that's not what happened so
19:29
we've landed in this spot and so I I now have certain concerns about and this
19:35
will sound odd from where we're coming from but I have certain concerns about what this is doing to kind of the appeal
19:43
of religion in a country where you're having a rise of secularism and a loss
19:50
of faith in all kinds of Institutions and you know I find the loss of broad
19:56
religious faith in this country to be very troubling I mean I I don't think that's a a good thing to be hoping for
20:03
but what we've seen with Trump and even going back farther than Trump with a certain kind of militant Evangelical
20:11
Christianity is that it turns off people people talk about how they are very
20:17
turned off by kind of the punitive restrictive backward-looking approach to what Christianity should be
20:25
and what Trump is pushing but I think it is a issue if by tying themselves to
20:32
this really flawed really toxic figure that Christianity especially white
20:40
protestantism has linked itself in the minds of younger Generations in particular with something that's really
20:47
negative and for a church that is fighting to hold on to its voters I mean this is a broad problem whether you're
20:53
talking about white you mean hold on hold on to its parishioners yes hold on
20:59
sorry there theith so this is something that you know it used to be that you were just looking at this as a problem
21:06
in mainstream protestantism but it has made its way into more conservative groups as well and so I do kind of worry
21:14
what it's going to mean for that side of this equation like they have definitely
21:19
damaged the brand I mean the good news though Michelle is that it you know liberals can sort of prop up religion
21:26
themselves just by going back to liberal Protestant churches and Reviving them right so you know be be the be the
21:33
change you wish to you wish to I mean but if you've damaged the whole idea of religion and increasingly religion is
21:39
viewed as a republican political arm that's a problem I was I was sorry I was
21:45
being mildly factious I know um so yes I think I I mean this isn't this is an argument that I have with my more Pro
21:51
Trump religious conservative friends who basically say you know look you may hate Trump but given how sex and socially
21:59
liberal and hostile to religious liberty the Democratic Coalition has become you have no choice but to support him and I
22:05
say well that works to a point but you are also creating a version of the cultural effect that I think you're
22:12
describing correctly where there is I mean the thing about all these things is they're very hard to measure like the
22:17
trend towards disaffiliation predates Trump it's that Trump did not cause this everything in cultural and political
22:23
life sort of happens on the margins and it is important to stress that a big part of religious disaffiliation is not
22:31
young college educated ex evangelicals turning against their parents religion
22:37
those people exist but a bigger part is workingclass Americans sort of dropping
22:42
out of religious life because they're dropping out of other forms of life altogether and a lot of those people are still voting for Trump well they still
22:49
consider themselves religious so it's it's a complicated well they identify they still believe in God Church they
22:55
still believe in God some of them I mean like a lot of the So-Cal nuns people with no religious affiliation are
23:02
disaffected workingclass Americans who yes still say they believe in God but aren't congregationalists or methodists
23:08
or Catholics anymore right so that's part of the story too and Trump picks up
23:14
disaffected voters who have left religion for one set of reasons and pushes some you know college educated
23:21
younger evangelicals maybe away from their parents' churches too but I agree
23:27
I I agree it's a big problem um don't think secular liberalism is doing that great either at the moment
23:32
but yes it's a real issue that the Trump era has exacerbated for religious
23:39
conservatives yeah but I mean look at the presidents of the 21st century you know setting Trump aside right I think
23:45
each of them give us a model of what it is to be a believer and to Model A you
23:53
know compassionate Christian faith right I mean George W bush the creator of of pepar one one of the most important
24:00
humanitarian efforts that the United States has done in in recent history you know to bring treatment for HIV and AIDS
24:08
to to Africa he you know his faith I think prompted him to want to end the war you know the Civil War in Sudan
24:14
which his administration successfully did you had Barack Obama who very much was a product of the black church and
24:21
you know culturally embodied those values of a certain kind of Christianity you have Joe Biden who's you know I
24:27
think a very kind of bog type of kind of Centrist Catholic and it's just it's
24:32
interesting to me that you look at that genealogy in the 21st century you you've actually had leaders who've modeled to
24:38
me what feels like a very normal kind of Christianity and I would say admirable
24:44
kind of Christianity with different political inflections and so Trump really is the very very big outlier in
24:50
all of that but that would seem to cut a little bit against Michelle's argument right I mean the most liberal forms of
24:57
protestantism are are the the mainline churches have not did not recover because Barack Obama modeled liberal
25:04
Christianity and they haven't recovered because Joe Biden has modeled liberal Catholicism so that should make us a little more doubtful I think about the
25:11
strength of this political effect even as again I I do think it's real Carlos
25:17
your mouth is open yeah I know I um yes my mouth is open maybe I'm just hungry Michelle hungry hungry for the truth the
25:25
word hungry hungry for the word of God the the we're talking about sort of a a
25:32
secularization of American life and a departure from church going and I wonder
25:39
I'm I'm trying to understand the connection to politics with this because
25:45
it's also that politics has in some ways become a new religion it's overlapping
25:51
so forcefully with religious inclination right in the past it was hard
25:58
to identify someone's political affiliation based on whether they went to church right now it's the overlap is
26:05
enormous like you know it's conservative Republicans and it seems that there are
26:11
there are times in which sort of religious observance and religious principle is defined by a series of
26:17
positions on on like policy questions on abortion rights or or on same seex marriage and I was thinking about this
26:24
Ross in the context of a prior column that you wrote um I read you very carefully the um we all do more
26:31
carefully than I read myself and you you wrote for instance that that the left has a hard time being happy in part
26:38
because they've sort of given up on God right I'm I'm sort of simplifying what
26:44
yes that that was the simplified version yeah yeah um and but when when I read that I immediately thought you know I
26:50
wonder if there's an extent to which the right has held on some portion of the right has held on to faith by not by
26:58
giving being up on God like you say the left has but by somehow turning that faith into a sort of
27:05
political almost culture War tool well I also think that like you know the quote
27:10
unquote being religious kind of gets a bit of a bad rap in the in being so closely associated with one idea of what
27:16
it means to be religious I mean one of the cases that I've been following in this whole abortion Saga is one in
27:22
Indiana where you know Jewish women brought a suit saying that the very very strict abortion ban there actually
27:28
conflicts with their religious beliefs and we've just been through Ramadan um there are many many different kinds of
27:35
religious Faith both you know liberal conservative and everything in between and I think that the overidentification
27:40
with one specific kind of Faith with politics is in itself kind of a problem
27:48
one thing that could change that kind of identification is if more liberal people
27:53
were religious right there certainly is a religious left I grew up around parts
27:58
of it I went at times to churches that were connected to it my own Catholic
28:04
Church includes obviously lots of political liberals but the story of the
28:10
last 40 years nonetheless is that the churches that are most associated with
28:16
liberal politics have had the most trouble conservative churches have had trouble too but it's liberal churches
28:21
have had the most trouble sustaining themselves and getting people to go to church so to the to the extent that you
28:27
want and I think you should want religion in America to mean something more than just southern white
28:33
evangelicalism or you know traditionalism in its various forms you
28:38
would need people who are liberal to be more religious and again to generalize
28:45
in the aggregate you'd need people to go to church or Sy been people raising
28:51
raising the alarm and begging Democrats not to see the field on religion I mean
28:56
you know Hillary Clinton had somebody on her campaign whose entire you know raise on Detro was to reach out
29:03
to Liberal religious voters I mean this is kind of a perennial issue for them
29:09
for years and years and years but again I just I just I just want to point out that the past many like basically every
29:16
Democratic president in my lifetime has been a professed believer I mean and now we have a presidential candidate who
29:22
like does he believe in God Donald Trump I don't know but it's not about it's not about the messenger it's about the
29:28
Outreach to the voters no but this is but it's not about either it's about whether liberals go to church right like
29:35
liberalism can be okay politically in a country that's secularizing but the fundamental issue driving the
29:42
identification of conservative politics with religion is the fact that liberals
29:47
especially the well-educated liberals who set the tone for the culture have decided to be in denial about the
29:53
existence of God to retreat into a vague agnosticism and to not get up on on Sunday or Saturday and go to church
29:59
that's what's driving the identification if you want the identification to stop dear listener go to church is going to
30:06
have a snowle no I'm I'm sorry but but but you know we've just talked about the fact that there are all these Trump
30:12
supporters who don't go to church right I mean okay I know you think they should go to church them fewer of them listen
30:18
to this podcast but dear Trump supporters who don't go to church go to church and while you're at
30:26
it read the New Testament people it's great I love it I love it you know it's it's interesting sort of Ross's
30:31
challenge to the religious churchgoing left just because I know so many
30:38
Catholic liberals you know Dan beran Dorothy Day type Catholic liberals who I
30:43
went to college with at Notre Dame who feel politically homeless and for whom
30:49
this incessant overlap and sort of identity formation between religion and
30:56
politics is is destructive and I sort of know that there are many reasons why
31:03
they have a harder time getting up on on Sunday as as Ross wants them to yeah and I I guess I I do think that there is a
31:10
deep American tradition of separating religion from politics and at least you know if they can't be clinically
31:16
separated at least having some some space and distance between them and I think that we're we're living in a
31:22
moment of upheaval about the interpretation of the Constitutions to separation between religion and
31:28
government and um you know I think that undoubtedly plays a role in all of this as well um it it feels unsettling I
31:35
think church and state is the is the division religion and politics will never be
31:40
divided and on that spiritual note we will close this
31:46
discussion and when we come back we're going to get hot and [Music]
31:56
cold [Music]
32:13
and we are back and finally huzzah it is time for hot cold where each week one of
32:18
us shares something we're into over or somewhere in between so who's got us this week uh I can do it um excellent I
32:26
am at least War towards Netflix's big hit science
32:31
fiction drama the three body problem which is adapted from a uh Chinese
32:38
science fiction bestseller it is I I actually don't I'm I'm writing my
32:43
newsletter about this so there will be spoilers in the newsletter but the way the show is structured I I don't even
32:49
want to say the most basic thing about about what the story is wait you're hot on it but you're not going to tell us
32:55
anything about all right fine it's about aliens fine it's about it's about aliens okay of course you like it of course of
33:01
no um but yeah it's about sort of interstellar conflict but with a very
33:06
interesting conceit for how the shape this takes where basically there is an
33:12
alien Fleet that is on the way to Earth to you know conquer us but it's going to take them hundreds of years to get here
33:20
and in the interim they have sent ahead sort of forces probes technologies that
33:26
are supposed to um not that kind Michelle that uh go to
33:32
go to church Michelle um the that are supposed to divide us prevent scientific
33:38
progress um all these kind of things to basically keep us stuck in decadence so
33:44
the show is in fact a merger of two of my interests this is your sweet spot decadence and stagnation and Aliens now
33:51
unfortunately I I don't think it's the guys who did Game of Thrones are doing it they're very talented they couldn't
33:58
land Game of Thrones looking ahead to the future books in this series I don't think they're going to be able to land
34:03
this one either um at least they have books to land on that's they do no that's true but the books the books get
34:09
you know the books they get weird the book get weird we just need a specialty on who can land series like this there
34:16
should be somebody out there who specializes in not having a lost ending
34:21
the makers of succession should be hired brought in for series Landings that's
34:27
Justified justifies actually every series should end with Tom wam scans
34:32
taking power like how does how does dune how does dune Emperor tomw scans you
34:38
know who wins the alien Earth War tomw scans that's what I'm here for okay well there we go I think that is what the
34:45
takeaway from this week's episode should be Tom wcam forever anybody disagree
34:51
yeah he'll he'll decide our abortion policy too God God and God and
34:56
tomw all right then well guys thank you so much this has been Illuminating
