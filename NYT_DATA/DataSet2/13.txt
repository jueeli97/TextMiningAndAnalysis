Why the G.O.P. Nomination Fight Is Now (All But) Over



0:01
from The New York Times I'm Michael
0:03
borro this is the
0:07
daily
0:09
today the real meaning of Donald Trump's
0:13
Victory last night in the New Hampshire
0:15
Republican
0:17
primary I spoke with times political
0:20
correspondent Jonathan
0:25
Weissman it's Wednesday January
0:28
24th
0:34
Jonathan are you
0:37
rolling I'm rolling I'm I'm right here
0:40
okay very good so it is at this very
0:43
moment 11:03 p.m. and we have almost the
0:48
full results of the New Hampshire
0:50
primary I think 70 some per of the votes
0:55
are in so just walk us through the
0:58
Topline numbers so it looks like Donald
1:01
Trump has beat Nikki Haley in New
1:04
Hampshire by about 10 and a half 11
1:07
percentage points that's certainly not
1:11
the kind of blowout that we saw in Iowa
1:14
it's not even as bad as some of the late
1:17
polling that had her down more like 15
1:20
16 percentage points but for Nikki Haley
1:24
a loss is a loss she really needed to
1:27
pull New Hampshire out and it only gets
1:31
a lot more difficult from here MH and
1:34
look what Trump won he won women he won
1:37
men he won Republicans he won
1:40
conservative Republicans he pretty much
1:43
did what he did in Iowa which was to
1:46
show that he has control over the
1:49
Republican
1:51
electorate right and now I think the
1:54
question on everyone's mind let's just
1:57
cut to the chase is whether this
1:59
domination battle is basically now over
2:03
did Trump just end Nikki Haley's
2:05
candidacy effectively thank you New
2:08
Hampshire for the love the kindness the
2:11
support and a great night here tonight
2:14
thank you so much so after the race was
2:16
called Nikki hilly came out to her
2:18
Afterparty I'll call it and she said now
2:21
you've all heard the chatter among the
2:23
political class they're falling all over
2:27
themselves saying this race is over well
2:30
I have news for all of them that New
2:33
Hampshire primary is the beginning of
2:35
this process not the end of this process
2:38
mhm this race is far from over there are
2:42
dozens of States left to go and the next
2:46
one is my sweet state of South
2:50
Carolina and she vowed she'll stay in
2:53
the race South Carolina voters don't
2:56
want a coronation they want an election
2:59
and we're going to give them one because
3:01
we are just getting started thank you
3:04
for the energy right and I think we have
3:07
all observed in this primary and in
3:11
pretty much every primary I've covered
3:12
Jonathan you've covered as well that
3:14
candidates say they are in the race and
3:17
suddenly they're not in a heartbeat we
3:19
saw that with Jeb Bush Marco Rubio in
3:22
2016 we saw that with Ronda Sanchez just
3:25
a few days ago just a few days ago
3:28
remember Dan Sanchez said he is not
3:30
going to kneel down and kiss the ring
3:32
and then just days later he knelt down
3:35
and kissed the ring so yes just because
3:38
a candidate is saying she is going to
3:40
keep going doesn't necessarily mean she
3:43
will she has to take stock and decide
3:46
whether it is good for her so I'll ask
3:49
this question again is this race
3:53
effectively over has Donald Trump for
3:55
all intents and purposes wrapped up not
3:58
officially but in kind of the political
4:01
real politique of this race the
4:04
Republican nomination yes Donald Trump
4:07
will be the nominee of the Republican
4:09
Party barring some miraculous
4:13
intervention that won't involve Nikki
4:16
Haley at this point well let's talk
4:17
Jonathan about why this played out the
4:20
way that it did in New Hampshire because
4:23
if you rewind the clock just a few days
4:26
ago a political lifetime ago our
4:29
understanding was that this was supposed
4:31
to be a three-person race in New
4:34
Hampshire a three-person race that would
4:36
we predicted be focused on the battle
4:39
for number two that's where we left our
4:40
listeners off a week ago when we talked
4:42
to Shane goldmacher with the sense that
4:45
unless either Haley or Ron Des santis
4:48
dropped out they would just muck up each
4:50
other's path to being competitive with
4:52
Trump Dan santis as we just talked about
4:54
drops out in the middle of this past
4:56
week a theoretical Boon to Nikki ha
5:00
and yet she lost by something like 10
5:03
points so just untangle that for us well
5:07
let's look at Ron de Sanz I mean by the
5:09
time Des Sanz dropped out he hardly had
5:12
any voters six percentage points in New
5:14
Hampshire in New Hampshire I'm sorry and
5:17
almost all of desantis's Voters said
5:20
that their second choice wasn't Nikki
5:22
Haley their second choice was Donald
5:25
Trump I actually think that desantis's
5:28
departure
5:30
was kind of a stab in the back to Nikki
5:33
Haley Des santis not only left two days
5:36
before the election in New Hampshire but
5:39
he endorsed Trump and he went out with a
5:42
blast against the corporatist Nikki
5:45
Haley he didn't want his voters to go to
5:48
her so that was a big blow even though
5:51
she got the two-person race she wanted
5:54
we saw Trump's numbers go up not down
5:57
but regardless of what DeSantis is
5:59
supporters did or didn't have to offer
6:02
Haley why then didn't Haley's own
6:05
strategy end up working at all in New
6:09
Hampshire where she has been on the rise
6:12
she campaigned a tremendous amount and
6:16
where her campaign said she was a
6:19
natural fit for this primary electorate
6:22
so what made her campaign think that say
6:24
that and why didn't It ultimately bear
6:27
out 4 % the largest chunk of the
6:32
electorate in New Hampshire is
6:35
unaffiliated independent not connected
6:37
to the Democratic or the Republican
6:39
Party 40% that is a big chunk right and
6:43
the Assumption was that most of those
6:47
40% the ones that wanted to vote in the
6:50
Republican primary were going to go to
6:51
Nikki Haley and Nikki Haley had a
6:54
template she could have looked back at
6:57
John McCain's campaign in 20 000 to see
7:01
how you energize these unaffiliated
7:04
voters how you get folks that aren't
7:08
really tied to a political party or an
7:10
ideology decide with you and that
7:12
template is to actually reach out to
7:16
them in a big way to say I want
7:20
independent voters I want a big tent you
7:23
know voters in New Hampshire especially
7:26
Independents really want authenticity
7:28
they want access McCain in 2000 he would
7:33
do these Town Hall meetings that would
7:35
go on and on and on until everybody had
7:39
asked every question that they could
7:40
come up with there was never a question
7:43
of him hiding he was out there he was
7:46
taking risks right Nikki Haley she would
7:49
go into like a diner she would give a
7:51
15minute stump speech and then she would
7:54
leave sometimes she would say I'm going
7:56
to take questions today and she would
7:58
take literally like five questions if
8:00
that that wasn't what New Hampshire
8:03
wanted to see they wanted access they
8:06
wanted authenticity and she just never
8:09
offered it up you know I was talking to
8:11
an independent from do New Hampshire a
8:14
few days ago and he had told me you know
8:16
I really wanted Chris Christie but with
8:20
chrisy out of the race I'll vote for
8:22
Nikki Haley I don't love her but I do
8:25
want to stop Donald Trump well he
8:27
reached out to me today and he said I
8:29
don't know if you're gonna do a
8:30
follow-up story but I decided I just
8:33
can't vote for Nikki Haley I'm gonna go
8:35
and write in Joe Biden's name and I said
8:38
why and he said you know Nikki Hy never
8:41
asked me for my vote she never gave me a
8:44
compelling reason for me to vote for her
8:46
and if she's not going to do that I'm
8:48
not going to fascinating so how did
8:50
Haley's failure in in this telling to
8:52
follow that template and truly persuade
8:56
Independence in New Hampshire to come to
8:57
her how did that ultimately man EST in
9:00
the final numbers we saw on Tuesday
9:03
night Haley won Independence no question
9:07
she won them but she didn't win them by
9:11
the overwhelming majorities that she
9:14
needed toh so she also had the other
9:17
side of the equation she needed to win a
9:21
good number of Republicans because
9:24
ultimately she's running for the
9:25
Republican nomination right and she
9:27
didn't do it Donald Trump absolutely
9:31
overwhelmingly crushed her with
9:33
Republicans especially with Republicans
9:36
who identified themselves as
9:38
conservatives it really showed her
9:40
fundamental weakness because New
9:42
Hampshire is not as conservative a
9:45
republican base as she's going to be
9:47
facing in South Carolina and for much of
9:50
the country actually it's a pretty
9:52
moderate Republican base but she didn't
9:54
really win those people either if you
9:57
were an identified Republican you almost
9:59
certainly voted for Donald Trump right
10:02
and you can't win the Republican
10:04
nomination without Republican votes and
10:06
just put a number around that how much
10:08
did Trump essentially Crush her among
10:11
Republicans here the numbers are
10:14
overwhelming Trump won about three
10:17
quarters three out of four Republicans
10:20
who went to vote voted for Donald J
10:23
Trump which is really interesting
10:25
because what that would seem to tell us
10:27
was that Nikki Haley's 44% or so second
10:31
place finish in New Hampshire is kind of
10:34
misleading because so much of it is as
10:37
you have gotten at unique to the scale
10:40
of independent voters in that state and
10:43
the reality is she did pretty poorly
10:46
among Republicans who make up the rest
10:48
of the primary season electorate that
10:51
she's going to have to contend with in
10:53
the next few races and all of that makes
10:56
a certain sense given that her campaign
10:58
became a increasingly anti-trump whose
11:01
main appeal was to the faction of
11:03
Republicans ready to move on from Donald
11:06
Trump which turned out in a place like
11:08
New Hampshire to be smaller than the
11:11
group of Republicans that very much want
11:12
him to be the
11:14
nominee yes from a message standpoint
11:17
she was really in a bind remember she
11:20
first started this as pretty respectful
11:24
of trump but she said you know it's time
11:27
to turn the page it's time for a new
11:29
generation of leadership I'm the new
11:32
face of the Republican party then she
11:36
started being a little more critical of
11:38
him on policy and talking about he ran
11:42
up the debt by8
11:44
trillion he's leaving behind our allies
11:48
in Ukraine that didn't work very well
11:50
either then she started sharpening her
11:53
message about Trump personally and by
11:55
the end she was talking about Donald
11:58
Trump as an agent of chaos with a brain
12:02
that seemed to be addling I mean she was
12:05
getting tougher and that didn't work
12:07
either right because the harder you go
12:09
at Trump the bigger the backlash is
12:13
against you but if you don't go at Trump
12:15
people will say well why are you even
12:18
running I'll vote for the original guy
12:20
right and if you're an independent why
12:22
would I turn to you at all if you're not
12:24
willing to criticize Trump and and so
12:26
Jonathan what we have witnessed step
12:29
back over the past two nomination
12:31
contests Iowa now New Hampshire is that
12:35
you can't beat Trump by running as his
12:39
political Heir which DeSantis tried
12:42
didn't work you can't beat Trump by
12:46
running as ultimately his Nemesis or
12:49
critic which Nikki Haley just tried you
12:52
just can't beat him as a republican
12:55
pretty much
12:57
period yeah
13:00
yes this is Donald Trump's
13:03
party and that's why after tonight
13:06
Donald Trump has this Republican
13:08
nomination wrapped
13:12
[Music]
13:21
up we'll be right
13:25
back so Jonathan with the caveat that
13:27
Nikki Haley does remain in the
13:29
Republican race for however long she
13:31
decides to stay in it we are now
13:35
effectively in the very strange position
13:38
of a general election that basically
13:41
begins now 10 months before election day
13:45
yeah and you know what's really crazy
13:47
about it is it feels to voters like
13:51
these are two incumbent presidents you
13:55
have an incumbent president in Joe Biden
13:59
running against a former president who
14:02
was only President you know less than
14:04
four years ago in Donald Trump right and
14:07
people are making a judgment based on
14:10
you know what kind of presidents they
14:13
were it feels like an incumbent on
14:16
incumbent election already and we should
14:18
say this is a general election that
14:22
improbably pits not just two incumbents
14:26
as you're describing but the exact same
14:29
two candidates who ran against each
14:31
other four years ago one of whom sought
14:35
to overturn the results of that last
14:38
election 2020 and is now relying on that
14:41
same system to elevate him to become his
14:44
party's nominee and then will seek to
14:47
have that same system elect him
14:49
president and that race that last race
14:52
where Biden faced Trump and its
14:54
aftermath was a complete National trauma
14:57
and yet our political system is
14:59
recreating that same race yeah and
15:02
remember after January 6th the
15:05
Republican Party had their moment they
15:08
could have been done with Donald Trump
15:11
at that time the wouldbe Speaker of the
15:14
House Kevin McCarthy went down to the
15:16
floor of the house to actually say no we
15:19
are not going to support the impeachment
15:21
of Donald Trump then we had Mitch
15:25
McConnell going to The Well of the
15:27
Senate
15:29
he had the opportunity to convict Trump
15:32
in that impeachment and after the
15:35
conviction the Senate could have easily
15:38
voted with just a simple majority to Bar
15:41
Trump from ever holding federal office
15:44
again instead they acquitted him so here
15:49
we are now and the entire Republican
15:53
apparatus is coalescing around him
15:55
they're looking at the Republican
15:58
elector it and saying well if you can't
16:01
beat him join him we saw Tim Scott right
16:05
behind Trump and and is victory speech
16:08
we saw John Corin who might be the next
16:12
Senate Majority Leader from Texas
16:14
indorsing Trump we saw people like
16:17
representative Nancy mace from South
16:20
Carolina who endorses Trump over Niki
16:24
Haley and it's not because Nikki Haley
16:27
is alienated all these people they don't
16:30
hate her they just see the handwriting
16:32
on the wall and they fear Crossing
16:35
Donald Trump they feel like now is the
16:38
time they have to unite behind the
16:41
eventual nominee right we should say on
16:44
the other side of the 2024 ballot and
16:47
contributing to this rematch we're
16:49
talking about is a Democratic party
16:52
apparatus and Leadership that decided
16:55
that Joe Biden should be the nominee KNE
16:58
again and they worked pretty tirelessly
17:02
to ensure that there would not be a
17:04
robust fight over that question and so
17:09
we now end up with a democratic nominee
17:13
that has real questions around his
17:16
popularity in a general election against
17:18
Trump who has real questions about his
17:20
popularity against Biden it is a truism
17:24
that incumbent presidents are very
17:26
difficult to defeat they almost always
17:29
win re-election and it was kind of
17:32
natural for the Democratic party
17:34
apparatus its leadership to Rally around
17:38
Joe Biden as the incumbent but this is a
17:41
weak incumbent you can look at any
17:44
polling you can see he's weak with young
17:47
voters he's weak with Progressive voters
17:50
who right now are very angry at the war
17:54
in Gaza he is weak with black voters who
17:58
were really stung by inflation and feel
18:01
like they didn't get all the things that
18:04
they were promised and he's really
18:06
weakened among Hispanic
18:08
voters he is looking like a weak
18:11
incumbent and yet the party Powers
18:15
rallied around him and now we have two
18:19
candidates running for president that
18:21
are not particularly popular with the
18:24
American people despite that though I
18:27
wonder if there is a way of looking at
18:29
tonight's results in New Hampshire just
18:31
to go back to the main event here as any
18:35
kind of a positive development for
18:39
President Biden if once Nikki Haley does
18:43
eventually drop out of his race does it
18:45
feel correct or at all safe to assume
18:48
that at least some of her supporters
18:50
especially these independent voters
18:52
might be comfortable voting for
18:55
President Biden in a general election
18:56
many of them have told our colleagues
18:58
that they couldn't stomach voting for
19:01
Trump and this is for all kinds of
19:04
reasons right for January 6th because of
19:05
Trump's conduct because of was criminal
19:06
liability and so on and therefore what
19:10
Nikki Haley did well in New Hampshire
19:13
bodess pretty well for Biden in November
19:16
and pretty poorly for Trump is that how
19:19
we should think about this when I look
19:21
at Nicki Haley's
19:22
44% of New Hampshire I don't think
19:26
that's great news for Nikki Haley I
19:28
think it is really great news for Joe
19:31
Biden the fact is Iowa is not a swing
19:34
state New Hampshire is a swing state and
19:38
I look at those Haley voters and see a
19:41
lot of potential support for Joe Biden I
19:44
mean the fact is we talked to a whole
19:46
lot of independent voters in New
19:48
Hampshire who said they're going to vote
19:50
for Nikki Haley because they wanted to
19:53
stop Donald Trump but they fully
19:55
acknowledged they plan to vote for Joe
19:58
Biden in the fall I think that what we
20:02
see in those Haley voters in the exit
20:06
polling is a real fear of another Trump
20:10
term and that fear is going to show up
20:14
in a movement toward Joe Biden that
20:17
being said we don't know what all these
20:20
Haley voters are going to do in November
20:23
some of them might fall in line with
20:26
Donald Trump just the way so many other
20:28
people do some might just not go out and
20:31
vote at all in November because they
20:33
don't like their choices and they don't
20:36
have to make one of the choices right
20:38
and to that point on this night where we
20:40
feel like we can say that this
20:41
Republican nomination contest is
20:43
basically over and that the general
20:44
election has commenced the reality is
20:47
that polling right now National polling
20:50
swing State polling shows this to be an
20:53
excruciatingly close general election
20:56
race yes it's 10 months out
20:58
but the closeness of it is kind of
21:01
extraordinary and those same polls tell
21:03
us each and everyone that voters
21:07
especially those who man up being
21:09
decisive in this election are just not
21:12
happy with their choices most Americans
21:16
did not want a rematch between Donald
21:19
Trump and Joe Biden and that's leading
21:22
to this real sense of
21:25
dread a fear of what is going to be
21:28
coming over the next 9 10 months and
21:32
even a denial you hear it all the time
21:37
Republicans saying oh Joe Biden isn't
21:39
really going to be the nominee somehow
21:42
there's some magical thing that he's
21:44
going to pull that the Democrats are
21:46
going to put up someone else or you talk
21:49
to Democrats and they say oh there's no
21:52
way Donald Trump's not really going to
21:54
be the nominee somehow maybe he'll be
21:57
put in prison it could happen maybe
22:00
he'll be knocked off the ballot by a
22:03
constitutional intervention but the fact
22:06
is Underneath It All everybody is really
22:10
afraid about what is brewing for this
22:14
coming election right what you're really
22:16
saying is that there's some wishful
22:19
thinking happening right now on the part
22:21
of both parties and it's born out of
22:26
this sense of denial that you are
22:28
diagnosing in the electorate I mean
22:30
people are so determined to avoid this
22:33
in their heads and in their worlds that
22:36
they're basically engaging in
22:38
Fantastical thinking we don't know
22:40
